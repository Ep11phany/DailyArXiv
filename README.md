| **[PixelRefer: A Unified Framework for Spatio-Temporal Object Referring with Arbitrary Granularity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23603v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong general-purpose capabilities in open-world visual comprehension. However, most existing MLLMs primarily focus on holistic, scene-level understanding, often overlooking the need for fine-grained, object-centric reasoning. In this paper, we present PixelRefer, a unified region-level MLLM framework that enables advanced fine-grained understanding over user-specified regions across both images and videos. Motivated by the observation that LLM attention predominantly focuses on object-level tokens, we propose a Scale-Adaptive Object Tokenizer (SAOT) to generate compact and semantically rich object representations from free-form regions. Our analysis reveals that global visual tokens contribute mainly in early LLM layers, inspiring the design of PixelRefer-Lite, an efficient variant that employs an Object-Centric Infusion module to pre-fuse global context into object tokens. This yields a lightweight Object-Only Framework that substantially reduces computational cost while maintaining high semantic fidelity. To facilitate fine-grained instruction tuning, we curate PixelRefer-2.2M, a high-quality object-centric instruction dataset. Extensive experiments across a range of benchmarks validate that PixelRefer achieves leading performance with fewer training samples, while PixelRefer-Lite offers competitive accuracy with notable gains in efficiency.</p></details> | 22 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Alita-G: Self-Evolving Generative Agent for Agent Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23601v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to perform better when scaffolded into agents with memory, tools, and feedback. Beyond this, self-evolving agents have emerged, but current work largely limits adaptation to prompt rewriting or failure retries. Therefore, we present ALITA-G, a self-evolution framework that transforms a general-purpose agent into a domain expert by systematically generating, abstracting, and curating Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools. In this framework, a generalist agent executes a curated suite of target-domain tasks and synthesizes candidate MCPs from successful trajectories. These are then abstracted to parameterized primitives and consolidated into an MCP Box. At inference time, ALITA-G performs retrieval-augmented MCP selection with the help of each tool's descriptions and use cases, before executing an agent equipped with the MCP Executor. Across several benchmarks GAIA, PathVQA, and Humanity's Last Exam, ALITA-G attains strong gains while reducing computation costs. On GAIA validation, it achieves 83.03% pass@1 and 89.09% pass@3, establishing a new state-of-the-art result while reducing mean tokens per example by approximately 15% relative to a strong baseline agent. ALITA-G thus provides a principled pathway from generalist capability to reusable, domain-specific competence, improving both accuracy and efficiency on complex reasoning tasks.</p></details> | 15 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Constrained Entropic Unlearning: A Primal-Dual Framework for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05314v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in real-world settings increasingly face the need to unlearn sensitive, outdated, or proprietary information. Existing unlearning methods typically formulate forgetting and retention as a regularized trade-off, combining both objectives into a single scalarized loss. This often leads to unstable optimization and degraded performance on retained data, especially under aggressive forgetting. We propose a new formulation of LLM unlearning as a constrained optimization problem: forgetting is enforced via a novel logit-margin flattening loss that explicitly drives the output distribution toward uniformity on a designated forget set, while retention is preserved through a hard constraint on a separate retain set. Compared to entropy-based objectives, our loss is softmax-free, numerically stable, and maintains non-vanishing gradients, enabling more efficient and robust optimization. We solve the constrained problem using a scalable primal-dual algorithm that exposes the trade-off between forgetting and retention through the dynamics of the dual variable, all without any extra computational overhead. Evaluations on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks across diverse LLM architectures demonstrate that our approach consistently matches or exceeds state-of-the-art baselines, effectively removing targeted information while preserving downstream utility.</p></details> | <details><summary>The T...</summary><p>The Thirty-Ninth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems</p></details> |
| **[Think Twice: Branch-and-Rethink Reasoning Reward Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23596v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on thinking models that externalize intermediate steps and allocate extra test-time compute, with think-twice strategies showing that a deliberate second pass can elicit stronger reasoning. In contrast, most reward models (RMs) still compress many quality dimensions into a single scalar in one shot, a design that induces judgment diffusion: attention spreads across evaluation criteria, yielding diluted focus and shallow analysis. We introduce branch-and-rethink (BR-RM), a two-turn RM that transfers the think-twice principle to reward modeling. Turn 1 performs adaptive branching, selecting a small set of instance-critical dimensions (such as factuality and safety) and sketching concise, evidence-seeking hypotheses. Turn 2 executes branch-conditioned rethinking, a targeted reread that tests those hypotheses and scrutinizes only what matters most. We train with GRPO-style reinforcement learning over structured two-turn traces using a simple binary outcome reward with strict format checks, making the approach compatible with standard RLHF pipelines. By converting all-at-oncescoringintofocused, second-lookreasoning, BR-RMreducesjudgmentdiffusionandimproves sensitivity to subtle yet consequential errors while remaining practical and scalable. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on three challenging reward modeling benchmarks across diverse domains. The code and the model will be released soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Agent Evolve: LLM Self-Improve through Co-evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23595v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated significant potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the success of RL for LLMs heavily relies on human-curated datasets and verifiable rewards, which limit their scalability and generality. Recent Self-Play RL methods, inspired by the success of the paradigm in games and Go, aim to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities without human-annotated data. However, their methods primarily depend on a grounded environment for feedback (e.g., a Python interpreter or a game engine); extending them to general domains remains challenging. To address these challenges, we propose Multi-Agent Evolve (MAE), a framework that enables LLMs to self-evolve in solving diverse tasks, including mathematics, reasoning, and general knowledge Q&A. The core design of MAE is based on a triplet of interacting agents (Proposer, Solver, Judge) that are instantiated from a single LLM, and applies reinforcement learning to optimize their behaviors. The Proposer generates questions, the Solver attempts solutions, and the Judge evaluates both while co-evolving. Experiments on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct demonstrate that MAE achieves an average improvement of 4.54% on multiple benchmarks. These results highlight MAE as a scalable, data-efficient method for enhancing the general reasoning abilities of LLMs with minimal reliance on human-curated supervision.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 4 figures, submitted to ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[Lightweight Robust Direct Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23590v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a popular method for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) due to its stability and simplicity. However, it is also known to be sensitive to noise in the data and prone to overfitting. Recent works have proposed using distributionally robust optimization (DRO) to address potential noise and distributional shift in the data. However, these methods often suffer from excessive conservatism and high computational cost. We propose DPO-PRO (DPO with Preference Robustness), a robust fine-tuning algorithm based on DPO which accounts for uncertainty in the preference distribution through a lightweight DRO formulation. Unlike prior DRO-based variants, DPO-PRO focuses solely on uncertainty in preferences, avoiding unnecessary conservatism and incurring negligible computational overhead. We further show that DPO-PRO is equivalent to a regularized DPO objective that penalizes model overconfidence under weak preference signals. We evaluate DPO-PRO on standard alignment benchmarks and a real-world public health task. Experimental results show that our method consistently improves robustness to noisy preference signals compared to existing DPO variants.</p></details> |  |
| **[FARMER: Flow AutoRegressive Transformer over Pixels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23588v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Directly modeling the explicit likelihood of the raw data distribution is key topic in the machine learning area, which achieves the scaling successes in Large Language Models by autoregressive modeling. However, continuous AR modeling over visual pixel data suffer from extremely long sequences and high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we present FARMER, a novel end-to-end generative framework that unifies Normalizing Flows (NF) and Autoregressive (AR) models for tractable likelihood estimation and high-quality image synthesis directly from raw pixels. FARMER employs an invertible autoregressive flow to transform images into latent sequences, whose distribution is modeled implicitly by an autoregressive model. To address the redundancy and complexity in pixel-level modeling, we propose a self-supervised dimension reduction scheme that partitions NF latent channels into informative and redundant groups, enabling more effective and efficient AR modeling. Furthermore, we design a one-step distillation scheme to significantly accelerate inference speed and introduce a resampling-based classifier-free guidance algorithm to boost image generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FARMER achieves competitive performance compared to existing pixel-based generative models while providing exact likelihoods and scalable training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Byted...</summary><p>Bytedance Seed Technical Report</p></details> |
| **[A Survey of Data Agents: Emerging Paradigm or Overstated Hype?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23587v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has spurred the emergence of data agents--autonomous systems designed to orchestrate Data + AI ecosystems for tackling complex data-related tasks. However, the term "data agent" currently suffers from terminological ambiguity and inconsistent adoption, conflating simple query responders with sophisticated autonomous architectures. This terminological ambiguity fosters mismatched user expectations, accountability challenges, and barriers to industry growth. Inspired by the SAE J3016 standard for driving automation, this survey introduces the first systematic hierarchical taxonomy for data agents, comprising six levels that delineate and trace progressive shifts in autonomy, from manual operations (L0) to a vision of generative, fully autonomous data agents (L5), thereby clarifying capability boundaries and responsibility allocation. Through this lens, we offer a structured review of existing research arranged by increasing autonomy, encompassing specialized data agents for data management, preparation, and analysis, alongside emerging efforts toward versatile, comprehensive systems with enhanced autonomy. We further analyze critical evolutionary leaps and technical gaps for advancing data agents, especially the ongoing L2-to-L3 transition, where data agents evolve from procedural execution to autonomous orchestration. Finally, we conclude with a forward-looking roadmap, envisioning the advent of proactive, generative data agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pleas...</summary><p>Please refer to our paper list and companion materials at: https://github.com/HKUSTDial/awesome-data-agents</p></details> |
| **[ESCA: Contextualizing Embodied Agents via Scene-Graph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15963v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) are making rapid progress toward general-purpose embodied agents. However, existing MLLMs do not reliably capture fine-grained links between low-level visual features and high-level textual semantics, leading to weak grounding and inaccurate perception. To overcome this challenge, we propose ESCA, a framework that contextualizes embodied agents by grounding their perception in spatial-temporal scene graphs. At its core is SGCLIP, a novel, open-domain, promptable foundation model for generating scene graphs that is based on CLIP. SGCLIP is trained on 87K+ open-domain videos using a neurosymbolic pipeline that aligns automatically generated captions with scene graphs produced by the model itself, eliminating the need for human-labeled annotations. We demonstrate that SGCLIP excels in both prompt-based inference and task-specific fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art results on scene graph generation and action localization benchmarks. ESCA with SGCLIP improves perception for embodied agents based on both open-source and commercial MLLMs, achieving state of-the-art performance across two embodied environments. Notably, ESCA significantly reduces agent perception errors and enables open-source models to surpass proprietary baselines. We release the source code for SGCLIP model training at https://github.com/video-fm/LASER and for the embodied agent at https://github.com/video-fm/ESCA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a Spotlight Paper at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[LLM4Cell: A Survey of Large Language and Agentic Models for Single-Cell Biology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07793v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) and emerging agentic frameworks are beginning to transform single-cell biology by enabling natural-language reasoning, generative annotation, and multimodal data integration. However, progress remains fragmented across data modalities, architectures, and evaluation standards. LLM4Cell presents the first unified survey of 58 foundation and agentic models developed for single-cell research, spanning RNA, ATAC, multi-omic, and spatial modalities. We categorize these methods into five families-foundation, text-bridge, spatial, multimodal, epigenomic, and agentic-and map them to eight key analytical tasks including annotation, trajectory and perturbation modeling, and drug-response prediction. Drawing on over 40 public datasets, we analyze benchmark suitability, data diversity, and ethical or scalability constraints, and evaluate models across 10 domain dimensions covering biological grounding, multi-omics alignment, fairness, privacy, and explainability. By linking datasets, models, and evaluation domains, LLM4Cell provides the first integrated view of language-driven single-cell intelligence and outlines open challenges in interpretability, standardization, and trustworthy model development.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 5 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[SafeMERGE: Preserving Safety Alignment in Fine-Tuned Large Language Models via Selective Layer-Wise Model Merging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17239v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is a common practice to adapt generalist models to specialized domains. However, recent studies show that fine-tuning can erode safety alignment, causing LLMs to respond to harmful or unethical prompts. Many methods to realign safety have been proposed, but often introduce custom algorithms that are difficult to implement or compromise task utility. In this work, we propose SafeMERGE, a lightweight, post-fine-tuning framework that preserves safety while maintaining downstream performance. SafeMERGE selectively merges fine-tuned with safety-aligned model layers only when they deviate from safe behavior, measured by a cosine similarity criterion. Across three LLMs and two tasks, SafeMERGE consistently reduces harmful outputs compared to other defenses, with negligible or even positive impact on utility. Our results demonstrate that selective layer-wise merging offers an effective safeguard against the inadvertent loss of safety during fine-tuning, establishing SafeMERGE as a simple post-fine-tuning defense.</p></details> |  |
| **[EgoThinker: Unveiling Egocentric Reasoning with Spatio-Temporal CoT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23569v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Egocentric video reasoning centers on an unobservable agent behind the camera who dynamically shapes the environment, requiring inference of hidden intentions and recognition of fine-grained interactions. This core challenge limits current multimodal large language models MLLMs, which excel at visible event reasoning but lack embodied, first-person understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce EgoThinker, a novel framework that endows MLLMs with robust egocentric reasoning capabilities through spatio-temporal chain-of-thought supervision and a two-stage learning curriculum. First, we introduce EgoRe-5M, a large-scale egocentric QA dataset constructed from 13M diverse egocentric video clips. This dataset features multi-minute segments annotated with detailed CoT rationales and dense hand-object grounding. Second, we employ SFT on EgoRe-5M to instill reasoning skills, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning RFT to further enhance spatio-temporal localization. Experimental results show that EgoThinker outperforms existing methods across multiple egocentric benchmarks, while achieving substantial improvements in fine-grained spatio-temporal localization tasks. Full code and data are released at https://github.com/InternRobotics/EgoThinker.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[ReCode: Unify Plan and Action for Universal Granularity Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23564v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world tasks require decisions at varying granularities, and humans excel at this by leveraging a unified cognitive representation where planning is fundamentally understood as a high-level form of action. However, current Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents lack this crucial capability to operate fluidly across decision granularities. This limitation stems from existing paradigms that enforce a rigid separation between high-level planning and low-level action, which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization. We propose ReCode (Recursive Code Generation), a novel paradigm that addresses this limitation by unifying planning and action within a single code representation. In this representation, ReCode treats high-level plans as abstract placeholder functions, which the agent then recursively decomposes into finer-grained sub-functions until reaching primitive actions. This recursive approach dissolves the rigid boundary between plan and action, enabling the agent to dynamically control its decision granularity. Furthermore, the recursive structure inherently generates rich, multi-granularity training data, enabling models to learn hierarchical decision-making processes. Extensive experiments show ReCode significantly surpasses advanced baselines in inference performance and demonstrates exceptional data efficiency in training, validating our core insight that unifying planning and action through recursive code generation is a powerful and effective approach to achieving universal granularity control. The code is available at https://github.com/FoundationAgents/ReCode.</p></details> |  |
| **[SafeCOMM: A Study on Safety Degradation in Fine-Tuned Telecom Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00062v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on telecom datasets is a common practice to adapt general-purpose models to the telecom domain. However, little attention has been paid to how this process may compromise model safety. Recent research has shown that even benign fine-tuning can degrade the safety alignment of LLMs, causing them to respond to harmful or unethical user queries. In this paper, we investigate this issue by fine-tuning LLMs on three representative telecom datasets and show that safety degrades even for light telecom domain adaptation. To this end, we introduce TeleHarm, the first telecom-specific red-teaming benchmark, which we use alongside established Direct-Harm and HexPhi datasets to systematically assess harmful behavior. We further extend our analysis to publicly available TeleLLMs that were continually pre-trained on large telecom corpora, revealing that safety alignment is severely lacking, primarily due to the omission of safety-focused instruction tuning. To address these issues, we evaluate three realignment defenses: SafeInstruct, SafeLoRA, SafeMERGE. We show that, across all settings, the proposed defenses can effectively restore safety without compromising telecom task performance, leading to Safe teleCOMMunication (SafeCOMM) models. Our work serves as both a diagnostic study and practical guide for safety realignment in telecom-tuned LLMs, underscoring the need for safety-aware instruction and fine-tuning in the telecom domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[ISA-Bench: Benchmarking Instruction Sensitivity for Large Audio Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23558v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Audio Language Models (LALMs), which couple acoustic perception with large language models (LLMs) to extract and understand diverse information from audio, have attracted intense interest from both academic and industrial communities. However, existing LALMs are highly sensitive to how instructions are phrased, affecting both (i) instruction-following rates and (ii) task performance. Yet, no existing benchmarks offer a systematic and comprehensive evaluation of this sensitivity. We introduce ISA-Bench, a dynamic benchmark evaluating instruction sensitivity for LALMs along three axes: instruction description, output format, and task composition. We assess recent open-source and proprietary LALMs using ISA-Bench, profiling both compliance and accuracy under controlled instruction variations. Experimental results reveal that even state-of-the-art LALMs suffer significant instruction sensitivity, leading to degraded performance on fundamental audio understanding tasks. To mitigate this issue, we fine-tune Qwen2-Audio on a specifically constructed complex instruction-variant dataset, achieving a marked improvement in instruction-following performance. However, this also induces nontrivial catastrophic forgetting: the model loses some previously mastered task capabilities when exposed to new instruction styles. Our benchmark provides a standardized basis for assessing and improving instruction sensitivity in LALMs, underscoring the need for instruction-robust audio understanding in real-world pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to icassp 2026</p></details> |
| **[Minimizing Human Intervention in Online Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23557v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce and study an online problem arising in question answering systems. In this problem, an agent must sequentially classify user-submitted queries represented by $d$-dimensional embeddings drawn i.i.d. from an unknown distribution. The agent may consult a costly human expert for the correct label, or guess on her own without receiving feedback. The goal is to minimize regret against an oracle with free expert access. When the time horizon $T$ is at least exponential in the embedding dimension $d$, one can learn the geometry of the class regions: in this regime, we propose the Conservative Hull-based Classifier (CHC), which maintains convex hulls of expert-labeled queries and calls the expert as soon as a query lands outside all known hulls. CHC attains $\mathcal{O}(\log^d T)$ regret in $T$ and is minimax optimal for $d=1$. Otherwise, the geometry cannot be reliably learned without additional distributional assumptions. We show that when the queries are drawn from a subgaussian mixture, for $T \le e^d$, a Center-based Classifier (CC) achieves regret proportional to $N\log{N}$ where $N$ is the number of labels. To bridge these regimes, we introduce the Generalized Hull-based Classifier (GHC), a practical extension of CHC that allows for more aggressive guessing via a tunable threshold parameter. Our approach is validated with experiments, notably on real-world question-answering datasets using embeddings derived from state-of-the-art large language models.</p></details> | 49 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Fixing It in Post: A Comparative Study of LLM Post-Training Data Quality and Model Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06522v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work on large language models (LLMs) has increasingly focused on post-training and alignment with datasets curated to enhance instruction following, world knowledge, and specialized skills. However, most post-training datasets used in leading open- and closed-source LLMs remain inaccessible to the public, with limited information about their construction process. This lack of transparency has motivated the recent development of open-source post-training corpora. While training on these open alternatives can yield performance comparable to that of leading models, systematic comparisons remain challenging due to the significant computational cost of conducting them rigorously at scale, and are therefore largely absent. As a result, it remains unclear how specific samples, task types, or curation strategies influence downstream performance when assessing data quality. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive side-by-side analysis of two prominent open post-training datasets: Tulu-3-SFT-Mix and SmolTalk. Using the Magpie framework, we annotate each sample with detailed quality metrics, including turn structure (single-turn vs. multi-turn), task category, input quality, and response quality, and we derive statistics that reveal structural and qualitative similarities and differences between the two datasets. Based on these insights, we design a principled curation recipe that produces a new data mixture, TuluTalk, which contains 14% fewer samples than either source dataset while matching or exceeding their performance on key benchmarks. Our findings offer actionable insights for constructing more effective post-training datasets that improve model performance within practical resource limits. To support future research, we publicly release both the annotated source datasets and our curated TuluTalk mixture.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deductive Chain-of-Thought Augmented Socially-aware Robot Navigation World Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23509v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social robot navigation increasingly relies on large language models for reasoning, path planning, and enabling movement in dynamic human spaces. However, relying solely on LLMs for planning often leads to unpredictable and unsafe behaviors, especially in dynamic human spaces, due to limited physical grounding and weak logical consistency. In this work, we introduce NaviWM, a socially-aware robot Navigation World Model that augments LLM reasoning with a structured world model and a logic-driven chain-of-thought process. NaviWM consists of two main components: (1) a spatial-temporal world model that captures the positions, velocities, and activities of agents in the environment, and (2) a deductive reasoning module that guides LLMs through a multi-step, logic-based inference process. This integration enables the robot to generate navigation decisions that are both socially compliant and physically safe, under well-defined constraints such as personal space, collision avoidance, and timing. Unlike previous methods based on prompting or fine-tuning, NaviWM encodes social norms as first-order logic, enabling interpretable and verifiable reasoning. Experiments show that NaviWM improves success rates and reduces social violations, particularly in crowded environments. These results demonstrate the benefit of combining formal reasoning with LLMs for robust social navigation. Additional experimental details and demo videos for this work can be found at: https://sites.google.com/view/NaviWM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emotion-Coherent Reasoning for Multimodal LLMs via Emotional Rationale Verifier](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23506v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is transforming human-computer interaction (HCI) from surface-level exchanges into more nuanced and emotionally intelligent communication. To realize this shift, emotion understanding becomes essential allowing systems to capture subtle cues underlying user intent. Furthermore, providing faithful explanations for predicted emotions is crucial to ensure interpretability and build user trust. However, current MLLM-based methods often generate emotion explanations that diverge from the target labels and sometimes even contradict their own predicted emotions. This inconsistency poses a critical risk for misunderstanding and erodes reliability in interactive settings. To address this, we propose a novel approach: the Emotional Rationale Verifier (ERV) and an Explanation Reward. Our method guides the model to produce reasoning that is explicitly consistent with the target emotion during multimodal emotion recognition without modifying the model architecture or requiring additional paired video-description annotations. Our method significantly improves faithful explanation-prediction consistency and explanation emotion accuracy on the MAFW and DFEW datasets. Through extensive experiments and human evaluations, we show that our approach not only enhances alignment between explanation and prediction but also empowers MLLMs to deliver emotionally coherent, trustworthy interactions, marking a key step toward truly human-like HCI systems.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Cancer-Myth: Evaluating AI Chatbot on Patient Questions with False Presuppositions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11373v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cancer patients are increasingly turning to large language models (LLMs) for medical information, making it critical to assess how well these models handle complex, personalized questions. However, current medical benchmarks focus on medical exams or consumer-searched questions and do not evaluate LLMs on real patient questions with patient details. In this paper, we first have three hematology-oncology physicians evaluate cancer-related questions drawn from real patients. While LLM responses are generally accurate, the models frequently fail to recognize or address false presuppositions in the questions, posing risks to safe medical decision-making. To study this limitation systematically, we introduce Cancer-Myth, an expert-verified adversarial dataset of 585 cancer-related questions with false presuppositions. On this benchmark, no frontier LLM -- including GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Claude-4-Sonnet -- corrects these false presuppositions more than $43\%$ of the time. To study mitigation strategies, we further construct a 150-question Cancer-Myth-NFP set, in which physicians confirm the absence of false presuppositions. We find typical mitigation strategies, such as adding precautionary prompts with GEPA optimization, can raise accuracy on Cancer-Myth to $80\%$, but at the cost of misidentifying presuppositions in $41\%$ of Cancer-Myth-NFP questions and causing a $10\%$ relative performance drop on other medical benchmarks. These findings highlight a critical gap in the reliability of LLMs, show that prompting alone is not a reliable remedy for false presuppositions, and underscore the need for more robust safeguards in medical AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Approximate Caching for Faster Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05530v3)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves the reliability of large language model (LLM) answers by integrating external knowledge. However, RAG increases the end-to-end inference time since looking for relevant documents from large vector databases is computationally expensive. To address this, we introduce Proximity, an approximate key-value cache that optimizes the RAG workflow by leveraging similarities in user queries. Instead of treating each query independently, Proximity reuses previously retrieved documents when similar queries appear, substantially reducing the reliance on expensive vector database lookups. To efficiently scale, Proximity employs a locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) scheme that enables fast cache lookups while preserving retrieval accuracy. We evaluate Proximity using the MMLU and MedRAG question-answering benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that Proximity with our LSH scheme and a realistically-skewed MedRAG workload reduces database calls by 77.2% while maintaining database recall and test accuracy. We experiment with different similarity tolerances and cache capacities, and show that the time spent within the Proximity cache remains low and constant (4.8 microseconds) even as the cache grows substantially in size. Our results demonstrate that approximate caching is a practical and effective strategy for optimizing RAG-based systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Middleware '25</p></details> |
| **[Less is More: Local Intrinsic Dimensions of Contextual Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01034v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the internal mechanisms of large language models (LLMs) remains a challenging and complex endeavor. Even fundamental questions, such as how fine-tuning affects model behavior, often require extensive empirical evaluation. In this paper, we introduce a novel perspective based on the geometric properties of contextual latent embeddings to study the effects of training and fine-tuning. To that end, we measure the local dimensions of a contextual language model's latent space and analyze their shifts during training and fine-tuning. We show that the local dimensions provide insights into the model's training dynamics and generalization ability. Specifically, the mean of the local dimensions predicts when the model's training capabilities are exhausted, as exemplified in a dialogue state tracking task, overfitting, as demonstrated in an emotion recognition task, and grokking, as illustrated with an arithmetic task. Furthermore, our experiments suggest a practical heuristic: reductions in the mean local dimension tend to accompany and predict subsequent performance gains. Through this exploration, we aim to provide practitioners with a deeper understanding of the implications of fine-tuning on embedding spaces, facilitating informed decisions when configuring models for specific applications. The results of this work contribute to the ongoing discourse on the interpretability, adaptability, and generalizability of LLMs by bridging the gap between intrinsic model mechanisms and geometric properties in the respective embeddings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025; in press). 10 pages, with an additional 17 pages in the appendix.

| **[MergeMix: A Unified Augmentation Paradigm for Visual and Multi-Modal Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23479v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language alignment in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) typically relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL). SFT is stable and efficient but requires large-scale human annotations and cannot capture subtle preferences, while RL brings in a reward signal for training, but suffers from overhead and instability. These limitations highlight a trade-off between scalability, robustness, and alignment quality. To address this, we propose MergeMix, a training-time augmentation paradigm that bridges SFT and RL. It first applies an attention-aware image mixing via token merge with more cluster representation and spatial context, and then presents a preference-driven training paradigm for MLLMs by building preference pairs with mixed images and raw images, and optimizing via SimPO loss. As a mixup augmentation, MergeMix enhances attention consistency and efficiency, surpassing other heuristic-based methods in classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MergeMix achieves competitive accuracy with improved efficiency, providing a scalable approach to preference alignment in classification and MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code Link: https://github.com/JinXins/MergeMix</p></details> |

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise, existing benchmarks largely overlook these tutoring skills. We introduce MMTutorBench, the first benchmark for AI math tutoring, consisting of 685 problems built around pedagogically significant key-steps. Each problem is paired with problem-specific rubrics that enable fine-grained evaluation across six dimensions, and structured into three tasks-Insight Discovery, Operation Formulation, and Operation Execution. We evaluate 12 leading MLLMs and find clear performance gaps between proprietary and open-source systems, substantial room compared to human tutors, and consistent trends across input variants: OCR pipelines degrade tutoring quality, few-shot prompting yields limited gains, and our rubric-based LLM-as-a-Judge proves highly reliable. These results highlight both the difficulty and diagnostic value of MMTutorBench for advancing AI tutoring.</p></details> |  |

We present a policy aware controller that uses a large language model (LLM) to interpret natural language requests against written policies and metadata, not raw data. The system, implemented with Google Gemini~2.0 Flash, executes a six-stage reasoning framework (context interpretation, user validation, data classification, business purpose test, compliance mapping, and risk synthesis) with early hard policy gates and deny by default. It returns APPROVE, DENY, CONDITIONAL together with cited controls and a machine readable rationale. We evaluate on fourteen canonical cases across seven scenario families using a privacy preserving benchmark. Results show Exact Decision Match improving from 10/14 to 13/14 (92.9\%) after applying policy gates, DENY recall rising to 1.00, False Approval Rate on must-deny families dropping to 0, and Functional Appropriateness and Compliance Adherence at 14/14. Expert ratings of rationale quality are high, and median latency is under one minute. These findings indicate that policy constrained LLM reasoning, combined with explicit gates and audit trails, can translate human readable policies into safe, compliant, and traceable machine decisions.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 1...</summary><p>The 17th International Conference on Knowledge and Systems Engineering</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose Video-Thinker, which empowers MLLMs to think with videos by autonomously leveraging their intrinsic "grounding" and "captioning" capabilities to generate reasoning clues throughout the inference process. To spark this capability, we construct Video-Thinker-10K, a curated dataset featuring autonomous tool usage within chain-of-thought reasoning sequences. Our training strategy begins with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to learn the reasoning format, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to strengthen this reasoning capability. Through this approach, Video-Thinker enables MLLMs to autonomously navigate grounding and captioning tasks for video reasoning, eliminating the need for constructing and calling external tools. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Video-Thinker achieves significant performance gains on both in-domain tasks and challenging out-of-domain video reasoning benchmarks, including Video-Holmes, CG-Bench-Reasoning, and VRBench. Our Video-Thinker-7B substantially outperforms existing baselines such as Video-R1 and establishes state-of-the-art performance among 7B-sized MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, their length, financial jargon, and nuanced language make fine-grained analysis difficult. Prior sentiment analysis in the financial domain required a large, expensive labeled dataset, making the sentence-level stance towards specific financial targets challenging. In this work, we introduce a sentence-level corpus for stance detection focused on three core financial metrics: debt, earnings per share (EPS), and sales. The sentences were extracted from Form 10-K annual reports and ECTs, and labeled for stance (positive, negative, neutral) using the advanced ChatGPT-o3-pro model under rigorous human validation. Using this corpus, we conduct a systematic evaluation of modern large language models (LLMs) using zero-shot, few-shot, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategies. Our results show that few-shot with CoT prompting performs best compared to supervised baselines, and LLMs' performance varies across the SEC and ECT datasets. Our findings highlight the practical viability of leveraging LLMs for target-specific stance in the financial domain without requiring extensive labeled data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Education Paradigm Shift To Maintain Human Competitive Advantage Over AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23436v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discussion about the replacement of intellectual human labour by ``thinking machines'' has been present in the public and expert discourse since the creation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as an idea and terminology since the middle of the twentieth century. Until recently, it was more of a hypothetical concern. However, in recent years, with the rise of Generative AI, especially Large Language Models (LLM), and particularly with the widespread popularity of the ChatGPT model, that concern became practical. Many domains of human intellectual labour have to adapt to the new AI tools that give humans new functionality and opportunity, but also question the viability and necessity of some human work that used to be considered intellectual yet has now become an easily automatable commodity. Education, unexpectedly, has now become burdened by an especially crucial role of charting long-range strategies for discovering viable human skills that would guarantee their place in the world of the ubiquitous use of AI in the intellectual sphere. We highlight weaknesses of the current AI and, especially, of its LLM-based core, show that root causes of LLMs' weaknesses are unfixable by the current technologies, and propose directions in the constructivist paradigm for the changes in Education that ensure long-term advantages of humans over AI tools.</p></details> |  |

Yet, LLMs require more inference steps when generating non-English text due to their reliance on English-centric tokenizers and vocabulary, resulting in higher usage costs to non-English speakers. Vocabulary expansion with target language tokens is a widely used cross-lingual vocabulary adaptation approach to remedy this issue. Despite its effectiveness in inference speedup, previous work on vocabulary expansion has focused on high-resource settings assuming access to a substantial amount of target language data to effectively initialize the embeddings of the new tokens and adapt the LLM to the target language. However, vocabulary expansion in low-resource settings has yet to be explored. In this article, we investigate vocabulary expansion in low-resource settings by considering embedding initialization methods and continual pre-training strategies. Through extensive experiments across typologically diverse languages, tasks and models, we establish a set of strategies to perform vocabulary expansion for faster inference, while striving to maintain competitive downstream performance to baselines. This is achieved with only 30K sentences ($\sim$0.01GB text data) from the target language.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Computational Linguistics</p></details> |

In this paper, we present AutoStreamPipe, a novel framework that employs Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the design, generation, and deployment of stream processing pipelines. AutoStreamPipe bridges the semantic gap between high-level user intent and platform-specific implementations across distributed stream processing systems for structured multi-agent reasoning by integrating a Hypergraph of Thoughts (HGoT) as an extended version of GoT. AutoStreamPipe combines resilient execution strategies, advanced query analysis, and HGoT to deliver pipelines with good accuracy. Experimental evaluations on diverse pipelines demonstrate that AutoStreamPipe significantly reduces development time (x6.3) and error rates (x5.19), as measured by a novel Error-Free Score (EFS), compared to LLM code-generation methods.</p></details> | Under review |

While state-of-the-art Software Engineering (SE) agents like OpenHands or Cursor use LLM-based summarization to tackle this issue, it is unclear whether the increased complexity offers tangible performance benefits compared to simply omitting older observations. We present a systematic comparison of these approaches within SWE-agent on SWE-bench Verified across five diverse model configurations. Moreover, we show initial evidence of our findings generalizing to the OpenHands agent scaffold. We find that a simple environment observation masking strategy halves cost relative to the raw agent while matching, and sometimes slightly exceeding, the solve rate of LLM summarization. Additionally, we introduce a novel hybrid approach that further reduces costs by 7% and 11% compared to just observation masking or LLM summarization, respectively. Our findings raise concerns regarding the trend towards pure LLM summarization and provide initial evidence of untapped cost reductions by pushing the efficiency-effectiveness frontier. We release code and data for reproducibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>v3: D...</summary><p>v3: DL4C camera-ready version to be presented at the 4th DL4C workshop co-located with NeurIPS '25; added OpenHands generality probe, added hybrid context management strategy</p></details> |

Serving hundreds or thousands of these adapters on a single GPU allows request aggregation, increasing throughput, but may also cause request starvation if GPU memory limits are exceeded. To address this issue, this study focuses on determining the joint configuration of concurrent and parallel adapters that maximizes GPU throughput without inducing starvation, given heterogeneous adapter and traffic properties. We propose a data-driven ML approach leveraging interpretable models to tackle this caching problem and introduce the first Digital Twin capable of reproducing an LLM-adapter serving system, enabling efficient training data generation. Experiments with the vLLM framework and LoRA adapters show that the Digital Twin reproduces throughput within 5.1% of real results, while the ML approach predicts optimal numbers of concurrent and parallel adapters with an error of at most 7.2% under heterogeneous, real-world workloads.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in a computer science workshop</p></details> |

While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promise in tackling VTG through reinforcement learning (RL), they overlook the challenges arising from both the quality and difficulty of training samples. (1) Partially annotated samples. Many samples contain relevant segments beyond the annotated interval, introducing ambiguous supervision. (2) Hard-to-ground samples. Samples with poor zero-shot performance produce consistently low and indistinguishable rewards during RL training, exhibiting no clear preference among multiple outputs and thus hindering learning efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose VideoTG-R1, a novel curriculum RL framework with reflected boundary annotations, enabling data-efficient training. Specifically, we propose a Boundary Reflection Agent that utilizes MLLMs to predict query-relevant timestamps outside the annotated intervals, allowing us to identify and filter out partially annotated samples, thereby reducing ambiguity. Furthermore, we introduce a Difficulty Estimation Agent to assess the training difficulty of each sample and design a curriculum RL strategy that dynamically masks the videos of hard-to-ground samples according to the training steps, easing the training difficulty and providing clearer preference. Experiments on the VTG and grounded VideoQA tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Remarkably, with only 10% of the training samples and 21% of the computational budget, VideoTG-R1 outperforms full-data counterparts under both group relative policy optimization (GRPO) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT). The code is available at https://github.com/ldong1111/VideoTG-R1.</p></details> |  |

However, a recent important paper questioned their effectiveness by demonstrating that a simple single layer linear model outperforms Transformer-based models. This was soon shown to be not as valid, by a better transformer-based model termed PatchTST. More re cently, TimeLLM demonstrated even better results by repurposing a Large Language Model (LLM) for the TSF domain. Again, a follow up paper challenged this by demonstrating that removing the LLM component or replacing it with a basic attention layer in fact yields better performance. One of the challenges in forecasting is the fact that TSF data favors the more recent past, and is sometimes subject to unpredictable events. Based upon these recent insights in TSF, we propose a strong Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework. Our method combines the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models including xLSTM, en hanced Linear, PatchTST, and minGRU, among others. This set of complimentary and diverse models for TSF are integrated in a Trans former based MoE gating network. Our proposed model outperforms all existing TSF models on standard benchmarks, surpassing even the latest approaches based on MoE frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting Religious Language in Climate Discourse](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23395v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Religious language continues to permeate contemporary discourse, even in ostensibly secular domains such as environmental activism and climate change debates. This paper investigates how explicit and implicit forms of religious language appear in climate-related texts produced by secular and religious nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). We introduce a dual methodological approach: a rule-based model using a hierarchical tree of religious terms derived from ecotheology literature, and large language models (LLMs) operating in a zero-shot setting. Using a dataset of more than 880,000 sentences, we compare how these methods detect religious language and analyze points of agreement and divergence. The results show that the rule-based method consistently labels more sentences as religious than LLMs. These findings highlight not only the methodological challenges of computationally detecting religious language but also the broader tension over whether religious language should be defined by vocabulary alone or by contextual meaning. This study contributes to digital methods in religious studies by demonstrating both the potential and the limitations of approaches for analyzing how the sacred persists in climate discourse.</p></details> |  |

Despite its success in single generation problem solving, the reinforcement learning fine-tuning process may harm the model's exploration ability, as reflected in decreased diversity of generations and a resulting degradation of performance during Best-of-N sampling for large N values. In this work, we focus on optimizing the max@k metric, a continuous generalization of pass@k. We derive an unbiased on-policy gradient estimate for direct optimization of this metric. Furthermore, we extend our derivations to the off-policy updates, a common element in modern RLVR algorithms, that allows better sample efficiency. Empirically, we show that our objective effectively optimizes max@k metric in off-policy scenarios, aligning the model with the Best-of-N inference strategy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Steering Evaluation-Aware Language Models to Act Like They Are Deployed](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20487v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) can sometimes detect when they are being evaluated and adjust their behavior to appear more aligned, compromising the reliability of safety evaluations. In this paper, we show that adding a steering vector to an LLM's activations can suppress evaluation-awareness and make the model act like it is deployed during evaluation. To study our steering technique, we train an LLM to exhibit evaluation-aware behavior using a two-step training process designed to mimic how this behavior could emerge naturally. First, we perform continued pretraining on documents with factual descriptions of the model (1) using Python type hints during evaluation but not during deployment and (2) recognizing that the presence of a certain evaluation cue always means that it is being tested. Then, we train the model with expert iteration to use Python type hints in evaluation settings. The resulting model is evaluation-aware: it writes type hints in evaluation contexts more than deployment contexts. We find that activation steering can suppress evaluation awareness and make the model act like it is deployed even when the cue is present. Importantly, we constructed our steering vector using the original model before our additional training. Our results suggest that AI evaluators could improve the reliability of safety evaluations by steering models to act like they are deployed.</p></details> |  |

Different methods have been proposed to mitigate suchhallucinations and fragility, one of which is to measure theconsistency of LLM responses -- the model's confidence in the responseor likelihood of generating a similar response when resampled. Inprevious work, measuring LLM response consistency often relied oncalculating the probability of a response appearing within a pool of resampledresponses, analyzing internal states, or evaluating logits of resopnses.However, it was not clear how well theseapproaches approximated users' perceptions of consistency of LLMresponses. To find out, we performed a user study ($n=2,976$)demonstrating that current methods for measuring LLM responseconsistency typically do not align well with humans' perceptions of LLMconsistency. We propose a logit-based ensemble method for estimatingLLM consistency and show that our method matches the performance of thebest-performing existing metric in estimating human ratings of LLMconsistency. Our results suggest that methods for estimating LLMconsistency without human evaluation are sufficiently imperfect towarrant broader use of evaluation with human input; this would avoidmisjudging the adequacy of models because of the imperfections ofautomated consistency metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a main conference paper at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

Recent advancements in FP8 inference, backed by native hardware support, offer a potential solution: executing FP16 models by default, while switching to FP8 models during sudden load surges to achieve higher throughput at the cost of a slight quality degradation. Although this approach facilitates effective SLO management, it introduces additional memory overhead due to storing two versions of the same model. In response, this paper proposes NestedFP, an LLM serving technique that supports both FP16 and FP8 models in a memory efficient manner by overlaying FP8 parameters onto FP16 parameters, allowing both models to share the same FP16 memory footprint. By leveraging a compact data format for the overlay and a specialized GEMM kernel optimized for this format, NestedFP ensures minimal degradation in both model quality and inference throughput across both FP8 and FP16 modes. NestedFP provides a flexible platform for dynamic, SLO-aware precision selection. The code is available at https://github.com/SNU-ARC/NestedFP.</p></details> |  |

This study examines the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate future research ideas from scientific papers. Unlike tasks such as summarization or translation, idea generation lacks a clearly defined reference set or structure, making manual evaluation the default standard. However, human evaluation in this setting is extremely challenging ie: it requires substantial domain expertise, contextual understanding of the paper, and awareness of the current research landscape. This makes it time-consuming, costly, and fundamentally non-scalable, particularly as new LLMs are being released at a rapid pace. Currently, there is no automated evaluation metric specifically designed for this task. To address this gap, we propose two automated evaluation metrics: Idea Alignment Score (IAScore) and Idea Distinctness Index. We further conducted human evaluation to assess the novelty, relevance, and feasibility of the generated future research ideas. This investigation offers insights into the evolving role of LLMs in idea generation, highlighting both its capability and limitations. Our work contributes to the ongoing efforts in evaluating and utilizing language models for generating future research ideas.

In \textit{Symbolic Neural Generators} (SNGs), symbolic learners examine logical specifications of feasible data from a small set of instances -- sometimes just one. Each specification in turn constrains the conditional information supplied to a neural-based generator, which rejects any instance violating the symbolic specification. Like other neurosymbolic approaches, SNG exploits the complementary strengths of symbolic and neural methods. The outcome of an SNG is a triple $(H, X, W)$, where $H$ is a symbolic description of feasible instances constructed from data, $X$ a set of generated new instances that satisfy the description, and $W$ an associated weight. We introduce a semantics for such systems, based on the construction of appropriate \textit{base} and \textit{fibre} partially-ordered sets combined into an overall partial order, and outline a probabilistic extension relevant to practical applications. In this extension, SNGs result from searching over a weighted partial ordering. We implement an SNG combining a restricted form of Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) with a large language model (LLM) and evaluate it on early-stage drug design. Our main interest is the description and the set of potential inhibitor molecules generated by the SNG. On benchmark problems -- where drug targets are well understood -- SNG performance is statistically comparable to state-of-the-art methods. On exploratory problems with poorly understood targets, generated molecules exhibit binding affinities on par with leading clinical candidates. Experts further find the symbolic specifications useful as preliminary filters, with several generated molecules identified as viable for synthesis and wet-lab testing.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 15 figures; partial overlap of experimental results with https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.02.14.634875</p></details> |

While many works have focused on improving the efficiency of legal professionals, the research on helping non-professionals (e.g., plaintiffs) remains unexplored. This paper explores the problem of legal claim generation based on the given case's facts. First, we construct ClaimGen-CN, the first dataset for Chinese legal claim generation task, from various real-world legal disputes. Additionally, we design an evaluation metric tailored for assessing the generated claims, which encompasses two essential dimensions: factuality and clarity. Building on this, we conduct a comprehensive zero-shot evaluation of state-of-the-art general and legal-domain large language models. Our findings highlight the limitations of the current models in factual precision and expressive clarity, pointing to the need for more targeted development in this domain. To encourage further exploration of this important task, we will make the dataset publicly available.</p></details> |  |

However, emotional experiences are shaped by demographic and cultural contexts. This raises an important question: Can LLMs demonstrate equitable empathy across diverse user groups? We propose a framework to investigate how LLMs' cognitive and affective empathy vary across user personas defined by intersecting demographic attributes. Our study introduces a novel intersectional analysis spanning 315 unique personas, constructed from combinations of age, culture, and gender, across four LLMs. Results show that attributes profoundly shape a model's empathetic responses. Interestingly, we see that adding multiple attributes at once can attenuate and reverse expected empathy patterns. We show that they broadly reflect real-world empathetic trends, with notable misalignments for certain groups, such as those from Confucian culture. We complement our quantitative findings with qualitative insights to uncover model behaviour patterns across different demographic groups. Our findings highlight the importance of designing empathy-aware LLMs that account for demographic diversity to promote more inclusive and equitable model behaviour.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables, EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |

Yet, they are almost always executed monolithically, which underutilizes the heterogeneous accelerators (NPUs, GPUs, DSPs) in modern SoCs and leads to high end-to-end latency. In this paper, we present NANOMIND, a hardware--software co-design inference framework for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) that breaks large models into modular ``bricks'' (vision, language, audio, etc.) and maps each to its ideal accelerator. The key insight is that large models can be broken into modular components and scheduled to run on the most appropriate compute units. It performs module-level dynamic offloading across accelerators on unified-memory SoCs. By combining customized hardware design, system-level scheduling, and optimized low-bit computation kernels, we demonstrate our framework with a compact, battery-powered device capable of running LMMs entirely on device. This prototype functions as a self-contained intelligent assistant that requires no network connectivity, while achieving higher throughput and superior power efficiency under strict resource constraints. The design further bypasses CPU bottlenecks and reduces redundant memory usage through token-aware buffer management and module-level coordination. Our system outperforms existing implementations in resource efficiency, cutting energy consumption by 42.3\% and GPU memory usage by 11.2\%. This enables a battery-powered device to run LLaVA-OneVision with a camera for nearly half a day and LLaMA-3-8B for voice interactions up to almost 20.8 hours.</p></details> |  |
| **[SimBench: Benchmarking the Ability of Large Language Models to Simulate Human Behaviors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17516v3)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) simulations of human behavior have the potential to revolutionize the social and behavioral sciences, if and only if they faithfully reflect real human behaviors. Current evaluations are fragmented, based on bespoke tasks and metrics, creating a patchwork of incomparable results. To address this, we introduce SimBench, the first large-scale, standardized benchmark for a robust, reproducible science of LLM simulation. By unifying 20 diverse datasets covering tasks from moral decision-making to economic choice across a large global participant pool, SimBench provides the necessary foundation to ask fundamental questions about when, how, and why LLM simulations succeed or fail. We show that, while even the best LLMs today have limited simulation ability (score: 40.80/100), performance scales log-linearly with model size. Simulation performance is not improved by increased inference-time compute. We demonstrate an alignment-simulation trade-off: instruction-tuning improves performance on low-entropy (consensus) questions but degrades it on high-entropy (diverse) ones. Models particularly struggle when simulating specific demographic groups. Finally, we demonstrate that simulation ability correlates most strongly with deep, knowledge-intensive reasoning (MMLU-Pro, r=0.939).

| **[MOOSE-Chem: Large Language Models for Rediscovering Unseen Chemistry Scientific Hypotheses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07076v6)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific discovery plays a pivotal role in advancing human society, and recent progress in large language models (LLMs) suggests their potential to accelerate this process. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs can autonomously generate novel and valid hypotheses in chemistry. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs can discover high-quality chemistry hypotheses given only a research background-comprising a question and/or a survey-without restriction on the domain of the question. We begin with the observation that hypothesis discovery is a seemingly intractable task. To address this, we propose a formal mathematical decomposition grounded in a fundamental assumption: that most chemistry hypotheses can be composed from a research background and a set of inspirations. This decomposition leads to three practical subtasks-retrieving inspirations, composing hypotheses with inspirations, and ranking hypotheses - which together constitute a sufficient set of subtasks for the overall scientific discovery task. We further develop an agentic LLM framework, MOOSE-Chem, that is a direct implementation of this mathematical decomposition. To evaluate this framework, we construct a benchmark of 51 high-impact chemistry papers published and online after January 2024, each manually annotated by PhD chemists with background, inspirations, and hypothesis. The framework is able to rediscover many hypotheses with high similarity to the groundtruth, successfully capturing the core innovations-while ensuring no data contamination since it uses an LLM with knowledge cutoff date prior to 2024. Finally, based on LLM's surprisingly high accuracy on inspiration retrieval, a task with inherently out-of-distribution nature, we propose a bold assumption: that LLMs may already encode latent scientific knowledge associations not yet recognized by humans.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

This paper introduces a benchmark for evaluating how well large language models (LLMs) can anticipate changes in job demand, especially in occupations affected by AI. Existing research has shown that LLMs can extract sentiment, summarize economic reports, and emulate forecaster behavior, but little work has assessed their use for forward-looking labor prediction. Our benchmark combines two complementary datasets: a high-frequency index of sector-level job postings in the United States, and a global dataset of projected occupational changes due to AI adoption. We format these data into forecasting tasks with clear temporal splits, minimizing the risk of information leakage. We then evaluate LLMs using multiple prompting strategies, comparing task-scaffolded, persona-driven, and hybrid approaches across model families. We assess both quantitative accuracy and qualitative consistency over time. Results show that structured task prompts consistently improve forecast stability, while persona prompts offer advantages on short-term trends. However, performance varies significantly across sectors and horizons, highlighting the need for domain-aware prompting and rigorous evaluation protocols. By releasing our benchmark, we aim to support future research on labor forecasting, prompt design, and LLM-based economic reasoning. This work contributes to a growing body of research on how LLMs interact with real-world economic data, and provides a reproducible testbed for studying the limits and opportunities of AI as a forecasting tool in the context of labor markets.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages + Limitations + References</p></details> |

With the rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based OpenQA methods have reaped the benefits of emergent understanding and answering capabilities enabled by massive parameters compared to traditional methods. However, most of these methods encounter two critical challenges: how to integrate knowledge into LLMs effectively and how to adaptively generate results with specific answer formats for various task situations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named GenKI, which aims to improve the OpenQA performance by exploring Knowledge Integration and controllable Generation on LLMs simultaneously. Specifically, we first train a dense passage retrieval model to retrieve associated knowledge from a given knowledge base. Subsequently, we introduce a novel knowledge integration model that incorporates the retrieval knowledge into instructions during fine-tuning to intensify the model. Furthermore, to enable controllable generation in LLMs, we leverage a certain fine-tuned LLM and an ensemble based on text consistency incorporating all coherence, fluency, and answer format assurance. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on the TriviaQA, MSMARCO, and CMRC2018 datasets, featuring diverse answer formats, have demonstrated the effectiveness of GenKI with comparison of state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, ablation studies have disclosed a linear relationship between the frequency of retrieved knowledge and the model's ability to recall knowledge accurately against the ground truth. Our code of GenKI is available at https://github.com/USTC-StarTeam/GenKI</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

To deliver these services intelligently and efficiently, robust and accurate task planning capabilities are essential. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the integration of LLMs into service robotics, with a particular focus on their role in enhancing robotic task planning. First, the development and foundational techniques of LLMs, including pre-training, fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and prompt engineering, are reviewed. We then explore the application of LLMs as the cognitive core-`brain'-of service robots, discussing how LLMs contribute to improved autonomy and decision-making. Furthermore, recent advancements in LLM-driven task planning across various input modalities are analyzed, including text, visual, audio, and multimodal inputs. Finally, we summarize key challenges and limitations in current research and propose future directions to advance the task planning capabilities of service robots in complex, unstructured domestic environments. This review aims to serve as a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners in the fields of artificial intelligence and robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Biomimetic Intelligence and Robotics for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Validating Formal Specifications with LLM-generated Test Cases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23350v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Validation is a central activity when developing formal specifications. Similarly to coding, a possible validation technique is to define upfront test cases or scenarios that a future specification should satisfy or not. Unfortunately, specifying such test cases is burdensome and error prone, which could cause users to skip this validation task. This paper reports the results of an empirical evaluation of using pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of test cases from natural language requirements. In particular, we focus on test cases for structural requirements of simple domain models formalized in the Alloy specification language. Our evaluation focuses on the state-of-art GPT-5 model, but results from other closed- and open-source LLMs are also reported. The results show that, in this context, GPT-5 is already quite effective at generating positive (and negative) test cases that are syntactically correct and that satisfy (or not) the given requirement, and that can detect many wrong specifications written by humans.</p></details> |  |

While recent tools leverage LLMs to generate KGs, their computational demands limit accessibility for low-resource environments. Our paper introduces LightKGG, a novel framework that enables efficient KG extraction from textual data using small-scale language models (SLMs) through two key technical innovations: (1) Context-integrated Graph extraction integrates contextual information with nodes and edges into a unified graph structure, reducing the reliance on complex semantic processing while maintaining more key information; (2) Topology-enhanced relationship inference leverages the inherent topology of the extracted graph to efficiently infer relationships, enabling relationship discovery without relying on complex language understanding capabilities of LLMs. By enabling accurate KG construction with minimal hardware requirements, this work bridges the gap between automated knowledge extraction and practical deployment scenarios while introducing scientifically rigorous methods for optimizing SLM efficiency in structured NLP tasks.</p></details> |  |

For example, a tweet containing a harsh political critique could be embedded in a tweet that celebrates the same political leader, or an ordinary product review could conceal a secret manuscript. This uncanny state of affairs is now possible thanks to Large Language Models, and in this paper we present a simple and efficient protocol to achieve it. We show that even modest 8-billion-parameter open-source LLMs are sufficient to obtain high-quality results, and a message as long as this abstract can be encoded and decoded locally on a laptop in seconds. The existence of such a protocol demonstrates a radical decoupling of text from authorial intent, further eroding trust in written communication, already shaken by the rise of LLM chatbots. We illustrate this with a concrete scenario: a company could covertly deploy an unfiltered LLM by encoding its answers within the compliant responses of a safe model. This possibility raises urgent questions for AI safety and challenges our understanding of what it means for a Large Language Model to know something.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, main paper 9 pages</p></details> |

We create the first QA dataset for BaZi-based persona reasoning, where real human experiences categorized into wealth, health, kinship, career, and relationships are represented as life-event questions and answers. Furthermore, we propose the first BaZi-LLM system that integrates symbolic reasoning with large language models to generate temporally dynamic and fine-grained virtual personas. Compared with mainstream LLMs such as DeepSeek-v3 and GPT-5-mini, our method achieves a 30.3%-62.6% accuracy improvement. In addition, when incorrect BaZi information is used, our model's accuracy drops by 20%-45%, showing the potential of culturally grounded symbolic-LLM integration for realistic character simulation.</p></details> |  |

Inference-time methods provide a flexible alternative to fine-tuning, but their uniform computational effort often yields suboptimal alignment. We hypothesize that for many alignment tasks, the initial tokens of a response are disproportionately more critical. To leverage this principle, we introduce AdaSearch, a novel blockwise search strategy. It adaptively allocates a fixed computational budget using a sampling schedule, focusing search effort on these critical tokens. We apply AdaSearch to sequential decoding and introduce its tree-search counterpart, AdaBeam. Our comprehensive evaluation across eight LLMs demonstrates that AdaSearch outperforms strong Best-of-N and fine-tuning baselines. Specifically, win-rates improve by over 10% for harmlessness generation, controlled sentiment generation, and for mathematical reasoning tasks relative to Best-of-N.</p></details> |  |

In particular, the effect of different modes of collaboration between humans and LLMs on co-creation outcomes is unclear. To test this, we conducted a randomized controlled experiment ($N = 486$) comparing: (a) two variants of reflective, human-led modes in which the LLM elicits elaboration through suggestions or questions, against (b) a proactive, model-led mode in which the LLM independently rewrites ideas. By assessing the effects on idea quality, diversity, and perceived ownership, we found that the model-led mode substantially improved idea quality but reduced idea diversity and users' perceived idea ownership. The reflective, human-led mode also improved idea quality, yet while preserving diversity and ownership. Our findings highlight the importance of designing interactions with generative AI systems as reflective thought partners that complement human strengths and augment creative processes.</p></details> |  |

It clearly and concisely summarizes the current status, strengths, and limitations of conventional techniques, and explores the practical benefits of integrating LLMs into NIDS. Recent research on the application of LLMs to NIDS in diverse environments is reviewed, including conventional network infrastructures, autonomous vehicle environments and IoT environments. From this survey, readers will learn that: 1) the earliest methods, signature-based IDSs, continue to make significant contributions to modern systems, despite their well-known weaknesses; 2) NN-based detection, although considered promising and under development for more than two decades, and despite numerous related approaches, still faces significant challenges in practical deployment; 3) LLMs are useful for NIDS in many cases, and a number of related approaches have been proposed; however, they still face significant challenges in practical applications. Moreover, they can even be exploited as offensive tools, such as for generating malware, crafting phishing messages, or launching cyberattacks. Recently, several studies have been proposed to address these challenges, which are also reviewed in this survey; and 4) strategies for constructing domain-specific LLMs have been proposed and are outlined in this survey, as it is nearly impossible to train a NIDS-specific LLM from scratch.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages,1 figure, 204 references</p></details> |

We introduce and formally define the new task of fine-grained scientific hypothesis discovery, which entails generating detailed, experimentally actionable hypotheses from coarse initial research directions. We frame this as a combinatorial optimization problem and investigate the upper limits of LLMs' capacity to solve it when maximally leveraged. Specifically, we explore four foundational questions: (1) how to best harness an LLM's internal heuristics to formulate the fine-grained hypothesis it itself would judge as the most promising among all the possible hypotheses it might generate, based on its own internal scoring-thus defining a latent reward landscape over the hypothesis space; (2) whether such LLM-judged better hypotheses exhibit stronger alignment with ground-truth hypotheses; (3) whether shaping the reward landscape using an ensemble of diverse LLMs of similar capacity yields better outcomes than defining it with repeated instances of the strongest LLM among them; and (4) whether an ensemble of identical LLMs provides a more reliable reward landscape than a single LLM. To address these questions, we propose a hierarchical search method that incrementally proposes and integrates details into the hypothesis, progressing from general concepts to specific experimental configurations. We show that this hierarchical process smooths the reward landscape and enables more effective optimization. Empirical evaluations on a new benchmark of expert-annotated fine-grained hypotheses from recent literature show that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

While promising, its inner workings remain unclear. In this work, we shed light on the mechanism of in-context retrieval augmentation for question answering by viewing a prompt as a composition of informational components. We propose an attribution-based method to identify specialized attention heads, revealing in-context heads that comprehend instructions and retrieve relevant contextual information, and parametric heads that store entities' relational knowledge. To better understand their roles, we extract function vectors and modify their attention weights to show how they can influence the answer generation process. Finally, we leverage the gained insights to trace the sources of knowledge used during inference, paving the way towards more safe and transparent language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

BERT-based models excel at semantic matching but lack complex reasoning capabilities. While Large Language Models (LLMs) are explored, most still use discriminative fine-tuning or distill to smaller models for deployment. We propose a framework to directly deploy LLMs for this task, addressing key challenges: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) error accumulation, discriminative hallucination, and deployment feasibility. Our framework, TaoSR1, involves three stages: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with CoT to instill reasoning; (2) Offline sampling with a pass@N strategy and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to improve generation quality; and (3) Difficulty-based dynamic sampling with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to mitigate discriminative hallucination. Additionally, post-CoT processing and a cumulative probability-based partitioning method enable efficient online deployment. TaoSR1 significantly outperforms baselines on offline datasets and achieves substantial gains in online side-by-side human evaluations, introducing a novel paradigm for applying CoT reasoning to relevance classification.</p></details> |  |

Large language models (LLMs) offer an alternative by simulating synthetic consumers, but produce unrealistic response distributions when asked directly for numerical ratings. We present semantic similarity rating (SSR), a method that elicits textual responses from LLMs and maps these to Likert distributions using embedding similarity to reference statements. Testing on an extensive dataset comprising 57 personal care product surveys conducted by a leading corporation in that market (9,300 human responses), SSR achieves 90% of human test-retest reliability while maintaining realistic response distributions (KS similarity > 0.85). Additionally, these synthetic respondents provide rich qualitative feedback explaining their ratings.

| **[Thought Anchors: Which LLM Reasoning Steps Matter?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19143v4)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current frontier large-language models rely on reasoning to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Many existing interpretability are limited in this area, as standard methods have been designed to study single forward passes of a model rather than the multi-token computational steps that unfold during reasoning. We argue that analyzing reasoning traces at the sentence level is a promising approach to understanding reasoning processes. We introduce a black-box method that measures each sentence's counterfactual importance by repeatedly sampling replacement sentences from the model, filtering for semantically different ones, and continuing the chain of thought from that point onwards to quantify the sentence's impact on the distribution of final answers. We discover that certain sentences can have an outsized impact on the trajectory of the reasoning trace and final answer. We term these sentences \textit{thought anchors}. These are generally planning or uncertainty management sentences, and specialized attention heads consistently attend from subsequent sentences to thought anchors. We further show that examining sentence-sentence causal links within a reasoning trace gives insight into a model's behavior. Such information can be used to predict a problem's difficulty and the extent different question domains involve sequential or diffuse reasoning. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate that our techniques together provide a practical toolkit for analyzing reasoning models by conducting a detailed case study of how the model solves a difficult math problem, finding that our techniques yield a consistent picture of the reasoning trace's structure. We provide an open-source tool (thought-anchors.com) for visualizing the outputs of our methods on further problems. The convergence across our methods shows the potential of sentence-level analysis for a deeper understanding of reasoning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paul ...</summary><p>Paul C.

| **[Code Aesthetics with Agentic Reward Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23272v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become valuable assistants for developers in code-related tasks. While LLMs excel at traditional programming tasks such as code generation and bug fixing, they struggle with visually-oriented coding tasks, often producing suboptimal aesthetics. In this paper, we introduce a new pipeline to enhance the aesthetic quality of LLM-generated code. We first construct AesCode-358K, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset focused on code aesthetics. Next, we propose agentic reward feedback, a multi-agent system that evaluates executability, static aesthetics, and interactive aesthetics. Building on this, we develop GRPO-AR, which integrates these signals into the GRPO algorithm for joint optimization of functionality and code aesthetics. Finally, we develop OpenDesign, a benchmark for assessing code aesthetics. Experimental results show that combining supervised fine-tuning on AesCode-358K with reinforcement learning using agentic reward feedback significantly improves performance on OpenDesign and also enhances results on existing benchmarks such as PandasPlotBench. Notably, our AesCoder-4B surpasses GPT-4o and GPT-4.1, and achieves performance comparable to large open-source models with 480B-685B parameters, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | 30 pages, 7 figures |

Automated Circuit Discovery (ACDC) has emerged as a pivotal methodology in circuit discovery, but its application to large language models is severely limited by computational inefficiency and prohibitively high memory requirements. Although several accelerated approaches have been proposed, they primarily rely on linear approximations to ACDC, which significantly compromises analytical faithfulness. Our proposed method for accelerating automated circuit discovery, Per Attention Head Quantization (PAHQ), takes a fundamentally different approach by optimizing the efficiency of each individual patching operation. PAHQ leverages a fundamental alignment between activation patching and mixed-precision quantization (MPQ): interpretability analysis through patching essentially performs targeted ablation studies. Therefore, we can maintain high precision exclusively for investigated components while safely reducing precision elsewhere in the network. PAHQ-accelerated ACDC reduces runtime by up to 80\% and memory consumption by up to 30\% compared to unaccelerated ACDC while maintaining faithfulness. Importantly, our method readily integrates with existing edge-based circuit discovery techniques by modifying the attention computation mechanism. This training-free approach provides a practical and novel pathway for accelerating mechanistic interpretability methods.

The reliance on large language models as backbones has lead to concerns about potential text dominance, and the exploration of interactions between modalities is underdeveloped. How do we measure whether we're heading in the right direction, with the complexity that multi-modal models introduce? We propose a joint method of computing both feature attributions and modality scores based on Shapley values, where both the features and modalities are arbitrarily definable. Using these metrics, we compare $6$ VLM models of varying context lengths on $4$ representative datasets, focusing on multiple-choice VQA. In particular, we consider video frames and whole textual elements as equal features in the hierarchy, and the multiple-choice VQA task as an interaction between three modalities: video, question and answer. Our results demonstrate a dependence on text and show that the multiple-choice VQA task devolves into a model's ability to ignore distractors.

Existing architectures lack for-mal mechanisms for negotiating these multi-stakeholder tensions, creating risks in accountability and bias. This paper introduces the Advisory Governance Layer (AGL), a non-intrusive, multi-agent framework designed to enable distributed stakeholder participation in AI governance. The AGL employs specialized agents representing stakeholder groups to evaluate pedagogical actions against their spe-cific policies in a privacy-preserving manner, anticipating future advances in per-sonal assistant technology that will enhance stakeholder value expression.

SBAN comprises more than 3 million samples, including 2.9 million benign and 672,000 malware respectively, each represented across four complementary layers: binary code, assembly instructions, natural language descriptions, and source code. This unique multimodal structure enables research on cross-representation learning, semantic understanding of software, and automated malware detection. Beyond security applications, SBAN supports broader tasks such as code translation, code explanation, and other software mining tasks involving heterogeneous data. It is particularly suited for scalable training of deep models, including transformers and other LLM architectures. By bridging low-level machine representations and high-level human semantics, SBAN provides a robust foundation for building intelligent systems that reason about code. We believe that this dataset opens new opportunities for mining software behavior, improving security analytics, and enhancing LLM capabilities in pre-training and fine-tuning tasks for software code mining.</p></details> |  |

However, the most powerful empathetic LSLMs are increasingly closed off, leaving the crucial details about the architecture, data and development opaque to researchers. Given the critical need for transparent research into the LSLMs and empathetic behavior, we present OpenS2S, a fully open-source, transparent and end-to-end LSLM designed to enable empathetic speech interactions. Based on our empathetic speech-to-text model BLSP-Emo, OpenS2S further employs a streaming interleaved decoding architecture to achieve low-latency speech generation. To facilitate end-to-end training, OpenS2S incorporates an automated data construction pipeline that synthesizes diverse, high-quality empathetic speech dialogues at low cost. By leveraging large language models to generate empathetic content and controllable text-to-speech systems to introduce speaker and emotional variation, we construct a scalable training corpus with rich paralinguistic diversity and minimal human supervision. We release the fully open-source OpenS2S model, including the dataset, model weights, pre-training and fine-tuning codes, to empower the broader research community and accelerate innovation in empathetic speech systems.

While supervised IML achieves strong performance, it depends on costly pixel-level annotations. Existing weakly supervised or training-free alternatives often underperform and lack interpretability. We propose the In-Context Forensic Chain (ICFC), a training-free framework that leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for interpretable IML tasks. ICFC integrates an objectified rule construction with adaptive filtering to build a reliable knowledge base and a multi-step progressive reasoning pipeline that mirrors expert forensic workflows from coarse proposals to fine-grained forensics results. This design enables systematic exploitation of MLLM reasoning for image-level classification, pixel-level localization, and text-level interpretability. Across multiple benchmarks, ICFC not only surpasses state-of-the-art training-free methods but also achieves competitive or superior performance compared to weakly and fully supervised approaches.</p></details> |  |

Although personalized preference learning addresses this by tailoring separate preferences for individual users, the field lacks standardized methods to assess its effectiveness. We present a multi-faceted evaluation framework that measures not only performance but also fairness, unintended effects, and adaptability across varying levels of preference divergence. Through extensive experiments comparing eight personalization methods across three preference datasets, we demonstrate that performance differences between methods could reach 36% when users strongly disagree, and personalization can introduce up to 20% safety misalignment. These findings highlight the critical need for holistic evaluation approaches to advance the development of more effective and inclusive preference learning systems.</p></details> |  |

To fill this gap, we propose "Blink-Think-Link" (BTL), a brain-inspired framework for human-GUI interaction that mimics the human cognitive process between users and graphical interfaces. The system decomposes interactions into three biologically plausible phases: (1) Blink - rapid detection and attention to relevant screen areas, analogous to saccadic eye movements; (2) Think - higher-level reasoning and decision-making, mirroring cognitive planning; and (3) Link - generation of executable commands for precise motor control, emulating human action selection mechanisms. Additionally, we introduce two key technical innovations for the BTL framework: (1) Blink Data Generation - an automated annotation pipeline specifically optimized for blink data, and (2) BTL Reward -- the first rule-based reward mechanism that enables reinforcement learning driven by both process and outcome. Building upon this framework, we develop a GUI agent model named BTL-UI, which demonstrates competitive performance across both static GUI understanding and dynamic interaction tasks in comprehensive benchmarks. These results provide conclusive empirical validation of the framework's efficacy in developing advanced GUI Agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

While effective for simple queries, traditional RAG systems struggle with large-scale, unstructured corpora where information is fragmented. Recent advances incorporate knowledge graphs to capture relational structures, enabling more comprehensive retrieval for complex, multi-hop reasoning tasks. However, existing graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) methods rely on unstable and costly relation extraction for graph construction, often producing noisy graphs with incorrect or inconsistent relations that degrade retrieval quality. In this paper, we revisit the pipeline of existing GraphRAG systems and propose LinearRAG (Linear Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation), an efficient framework that enables reliable graph construction and precise passage retrieval. Specifically, LinearRAG constructs a relation-free hierarchical graph, termed Tri-Graph, using only lightweight entity extraction and semantic linking, avoiding unstable relation modeling. This new paradigm of graph construction scales linearly with corpus size and incurs no extra token consumption, providing an economical and reliable indexing of the original passages. For retrieval, LinearRAG adopts a two-stage strategy: (i) relevant entity activation via local semantic bridging, followed by (ii) passage retrieval through global importance aggregation. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that LinearRAG significantly outperforms baseline models.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we study whether multi-turn training with human feedback is necessary for reasoning tasks. We compare conventional single-turn training with three multi-turn strategies and reach contrary conclusions to previous research. We find that models trained in a single-turn setting generalize effectively to both single- and multi-turn evaluations, while models trained with multi-turn strategies exhibit a significant degradation in single-turn reasoning performance. These results suggest that for tasks with complete information, robust single-turn training remains more effective and reliable, as multi-turn training with basic feedback provides limited benefits and can even degrade reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Guardrail for Safety Preservation: When Safety-Sensitive Subspace Meets Harmful-Resistant Null-Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14301v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in diverse tasks, yet their safety alignment remains fragile during adaptation. Even when fine-tuning on benign data or with low-rank adaptation, pre-trained safety behaviors are easily degraded, leading to harmful responses in the fine-tuned models. To address this challenge, we propose GuardSpace, a guardrail framework for preserving safety alignment throughout fine-tuning, composed of two key components: a safety-sensitive subspace and a harmful-resistant null space. First, we explicitly decompose pre-trained weights into safety-relevant and safety-irrelevant components using covariance-preconditioned singular value decomposition, and initialize low-rank adapters from the safety-irrelevant ones, while freezing safety-relevant components to preserve their associated safety mechanism. Second, we construct a null space projector that restricts adapter updates from altering safe outputs on harmful prompts, thereby maintaining the original refusal behavior. Experiments with various pre-trained models on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that GuardSpace achieves superior performance over existing methods. Notably, for Llama-2-7B-Chat fine-tuned on GSM8K, GuardSpace outperforms the state-of-the-art method AsFT, reducing the average harmful score from 14.4% to 3.6%, while improving the accuracy from from 26.0% to 28.0%.</p></details> |  |

Most existing resources pair problems with solutions, but omit the intermediate thought process that guides coding. To close this gap, we present a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline that produces nearly 800k instruction-reasoning-code-test quadruplets. Each sample combines a task, a step-by-step reasoning trace, a working solution, and executable tests, enabling models to learn not just the what but also the how of problem solving. Our pipeline combines four key components: curated contest problems, web-mined content filtered by relevance classifiers, data expansion guided by reasoning patterns, and multi-stage execution-based validation. A genetic mutation algorithm further increases task diversity while maintaining consistency between reasoning traces and code implementations. Our key finding is that fine-tuning LLMs on this dataset yields consistent improvements on coding benchmarks. Beyond raw accuracy, reasoning-aware data can substitute for model scaling, generalize across architectures, and outperform leading open-source alternatives under identical sample budgets. Our work establishes reasoning-centered synthetic data generation as an efficient approach for advancing coding capabilities in LLMs. We publish our dataset and generation pipeline to facilitate further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: The 4th Deep Learning for Code Workshop (DL4C)</p></details> |

While recent advancements in post-training techniques, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), leverage increased sampling with relative reward scoring to achieve superior performance, these methods often suffer from training instability that limits their practical adoption. As a next step, we present Group Variance Policy Optimization (GVPO). GVPO incorporates the analytical solution to KL-constrained reward maximization directly into its gradient weights, ensuring alignment with the optimal policy. The method provides intuitive physical interpretations: its gradient mirrors the mean squared error between the central distance of implicit rewards and that of actual rewards. GVPO offers two key advantages: (1) it guarantees a unique optimal solution, exactly the KL-constrained reward maximization objective, (2) it supports flexible sampling distributions that avoids on-policy and importance sampling limitations. By unifying theoretical guarantees with practical adaptability, GVPO establishes a new paradigm for reliable and versatile LLM post-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

The advancement of machine learning methods in relation extraction, along with the development of large medical text databases, has enabled the low cost extraction of such relations compared to other approaches that typically require expert knowledge. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are limited datasets specifically designed for drug drug relation extraction currently available. Therefore, employing transfer learning becomes necessary to apply machine learning methods in this domain. In this study, we propose DREAM, a method that first employs a trained relation extraction model to discover relations between entities and then applies this model to a corpus of medical texts to construct an ontology of drug relationships. The extracted relations are subsequently validated using a large language model. Quantitative results indicate that the LLM agreed with 71 of the relations extracted from a subset of PubMed abstracts. Furthermore, our qualitative analysis indicates that this approach can uncover ambiguities in the medical domain, highlighting the challenges inherent in relation extraction in this field.</p></details> |  |

However, evaluating their performance in realistic and complex social interactions remains a significant challenge. Most previous research built datasets through simulated agent-to-agent interactions, which fails to capture the authentic linguistic styles and relational dynamics found in real human conversations. To address this gap, we introduce SI-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate aspects of social intelligence in LLMs. Grounded in broad social science theories, SI-Bench contains 2,221 authentic multi-turn dialogues collected from a social networking application. We further selected a subset of 312 dialogues for manual annotation across 8 major models. The experiments show that SOTA models have surpassed the human expert in process reasoning under complex social situations, yet they still fall behind humans in reply quality. Moreover, introducing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning may degrade the performance of LLMs in social dialogue tasks. All datasets are openly available at https://github.com/SI-Bench/SI-Bench.git.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |

Current benchmarks focus on single-turn interactions with generic policies, failing to capture the conversational dynamics of real-world usage and the application-specific harms that emerge in context. Such potential oversights can lead to harms that go unnoticed in standard safety benchmarks and other current evaluation methodologies. To address these needs for robust AI safety evaluation, we introduce SAGE (Safety AI Generic Evaluation), an automated modular framework designed for customized and dynamic harm evaluations. SAGE employs prompted adversarial agents with diverse personalities based on the Big Five model, enabling system-aware multi-turn conversations that adapt to target applications and harm policies. We evaluate seven state-of-the-art LLMs across three applications and harm policies. Multi-turn experiments show that harm increases with conversation length, model behavior varies significantly when exposed to different user personalities and scenarios, and some models minimize harm via high refusal rates that reduce usefulness. We also demonstrate policy sensitivity within a harm category where tightening a child-focused sexual policy substantially increases measured defects across applications. These results motivate adaptive, policy-aware, and context-specific testing for safer real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

These limitations arise from the absence of theory-aligned supervision and the difficulty of capturing nuanced mental processes in real-world narratives. To address this gap, we leverage expert-labeled, psychologically rich scenarios and propose a trajectory-aware reinforcement learning framework that explicitly imitates expert psychological thought patterns. By integrating real-world stimuli with structured reasoning guidance, our approach enables compact models to internalize social-cognitive principles, perform nuanced psychological inference, and support continual self-improvement. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks further demonstrate that our models achieve expert-level interpretive capabilities, exhibiting strong out-of-distribution generalization and robust continual learning across diverse, challenging, and psychologically grounded tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Direct Generation: A Decomposed Approach to Well-Crafted Screenwriting with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23163v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The screenplay serves as the foundation for television production, defining narrative structure, character development, and dialogue. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show great potential in creative writing, direct end-to-end generation approaches often fail to produce well-crafted screenplays. We argue this failure stems from forcing a single model to simultaneously master two disparate capabilities: creative narrative construction and rigid format adherence. The resulting outputs may mimic superficial style but lack the deep structural integrity and storytelling substance required for professional use. To enable LLMs to generate high-quality screenplays, we introduce Dual-Stage Refinement (DSR), a decomposed framework that decouples creative narrative generation from format conversion. The first stage transforms a brief outline into rich, novel-style prose. The second stage refines this narrative into a professionally formatted screenplay. This separation enables the model to specialize in one distinct capability at each stage. A key challenge in implementing DSR is the scarcity of paired outline-to-novel training data. We address this through hybrid data synthesis: reverse synthesis deconstructs existing screenplays into structured inputs, while forward synthesis leverages these inputs to generate high-quality narrative texts as training targets. Blind evaluations by professional screenwriters show that DSR achieves a 75% win rate against strong baselines like Gemini-2.5-Pro and reaches 82.7% of human-level performance. Our work demonstrates that decomposed generation architecture with tailored data synthesis effectively specializes LLMs in complex creative domains.</p></details> |  |

However, existing quality-first paradigms often overlook valuable signals in discarded low-quality data and rely on imperfect quality filters. We introduce ENTP (Enhancing low-quality SFT data via Neural-symbolic Text Purge-Mix), a framework that revitalizes low-quality corpora through symbolic purification and neural reconstruction. The symbolic module identifies and prunes noisy samples based on statistical priors, while the neural component synthesizes enriched instruction-response pairs by leveraging latent representations and model knowledge. This neural-symbolic synergy enhances data informativeness and diversity. Experiments show that ENTP-augmented datasets, constructed exclusively from low-quality data, outperform 13 established data-selection baselines across five instruction-following benchmarks, and even surpass fine-tuning on the full original dataset (approximately 300K examples). Our results highlight the untapped potential of low-quality data and underscore the importance of intelligent purification and synthesis for efficient instruction alignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Echo State Transformer: Attention Over Finite Memories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02917v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models and their underlying Transformer architecture are remarkably efficient, they do not reflect how our brain processes and learns a diversity of cognitive tasks such as language and working memory. Furthermore, sequential data processing with Transformers encounters a fundamental barrier: quadratic complexity growth with sequence length. Motivated by these limitations, our ambition is to create more efficient models that are less reliant on intensive computations. We introduce Echo State Transformers (EST), a hybrid architecture that elegantly resolves this challenge while demonstrating exceptional performance in classification and detection tasks. EST integrates the Transformer attention mechanisms with principles from Reservoir Computing to create a fixed-size window distributed memory system. Drawing inspiration from Echo State Networks, the most prominent instance of the Reservoir Computing paradigm, our approach leverages reservoirs (random recurrent networks) as a lightweight and efficient memory. Our architecture integrates a new module called ''Working Memory'' based on several reservoirs working in parallel. These reservoirs work as independent working memory units with distinct internal dynamics. A novelty here is that the classical reservoir hyperparameters, controlling the dynamics, are now trained. Thus, the EST dynamically adapts the reservoir memory/non-linearity trade-off. Thanks to these working memory units, EST achieves constant computational complexity at each processing step, effectively breaking the quadratic scaling problem of standard Transformers. We evaluate ESTs on a recent challenging timeseries benchmark: the Time Series Library, which comprises 69 tasks across five categories. Results show that ESTs ranks first overall in two of five categories, outperforming strong state-of-the-art baselines on classification and anomaly detection tasks, while remaining competitive on short-term forecasting. These results position ESTs as a compelling alternative for time-series classification and anomaly detection, and a practical complement to transformer-style models in applications that prioritize robust representations and sensitive event detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Confidence Estimates Decide When Chain-of-Thought Is Necessary for LLMs?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21007v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a common technique for enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). While extended reasoning can boost accuracy on complex tasks, it is often unnecessary and substantially increases token usage, limiting the practicality of reasoning models in many scenarios. Recent models, such as GPT-OSS and Qwen3, expose controls that enable users to adjust the length of CoT or determine whether it is used at all. Yet, it remains unclear when CoT should be used: on some tasks it improves performance, while on others it provides little benefit or even harms performance. We address this challenge with confidence-gated CoT, where a model invokes reasoning only when confidence in its direct answer is low. To this end, we present the first systematic study of training-free confidence estimation methods for CoT gating. Specifically, we evaluate four training-free confidence estimation methods and compare them to a random baseline and an oracle that always knows when CoT is needed. Through extensive experiments, we show that existing training-free confidence measures can reduce redundant CoT and outperform randomly invoked CoT. However, the utility of individual confidence measures is inconsistent, varying with both the dataset and the model, underscoring the difficulty of deploying confidence-gated CoT in practice. By analysing both strengths and failure modes, our study highlights the potential and limitations of current methods and paves the way toward more reliable adaptive gating of CoT.</p></details> | Under Review |

This limitation has motivated a growing interest in unsupervised paradigms as a third stage of post-training after SFT and RL. While recent efforts have explored this direction, their methods are complex and difficult to iterate. To address this, we propose MM-UPT, a simple yet effective framework for unsupervised post-training of MLLMs, enabling continual self-improvement without any external supervision. The training method of MM-UPT builds upon GRPO, replacing traditional reward signals with a self-rewarding mechanism based on majority voting over multiple sampled responses. Our experiments demonstrate that such training method effectively improves the reasoning ability of Qwen2.5-VL-7B (e.g., 66.3\%$\rightarrow$72.9\% on MathVista, 62.9\%$\rightarrow$68.7\% on We-Math), using standard dataset without ground truth labels. To further explore scalability, we extend our framework to a data self-generation setting, designing two strategies that prompt the MLLM to synthesize new training samples on its own. Additional experiments show that combining these synthetic data with the unsupervised training method can also boost performance, highlighting a promising approach for scalable self-improvement. Overall, MM-UPT offers a new paradigm for autonomous enhancement of MLLMs, serving as a critical third step after initial SFT and RL in the absence of external supervision.

However, these models face a fundamental challenge when processing raw biomolecular sequences: the tokenization dilemma. Whether treating sequences as a specialized language, risking the loss of functional motif information, or as a separate modality, introducing formidable alignment challenges, current strategies fundamentally limit their reasoning capacity. We challenge this sequence-centric paradigm by positing that a more effective strategy is to provide Sci-LLMs with high-level structured context derived from established bioinformatics tools, thereby bypassing the need to interpret low-level noisy sequence data directly. Through a systematic comparison of leading Sci-LLMs on biological reasoning tasks, we tested three input modes: sequence-only, context-only, and a combination of both. Our findings are striking: the context-only approach consistently and substantially outperforms all other modes. Even more revealing, the inclusion of the raw sequence alongside its high-level context consistently degrades performance, indicating that raw sequences act as informational noise, even for models with specialized tokenization schemes. These results suggest that the primary strength of existing Sci-LLMs lies not in their nascent ability to interpret biomolecular syntax from scratch, but in their profound capacity for reasoning over structured, human-readable knowledge. Therefore, we argue for reframing Sci-LLMs not as sequence decoders, but as powerful reasoning engines over expert knowledge. This work lays the foundation for a new class of hybrid scientific AI agents, repositioning the developmental focus from direct sequence interpretation towards high-level knowledge synthesis.

LoRA essentially describes the projection of an input space into a low-dimensional output space, with the dimensionality determined by the LoRA rank. In standard LoRA, all input tokens share the same weights and undergo an identical input-output projection. This limits LoRA's ability to capture token-specific information due to the inherent semantic differences among tokens. To address this limitation, we propose Token-wise Projected Low-Rank Adaptation (TopLoRA), which dynamically adjusts LoRA weights according to the input token, thereby learning token-wise input-output projections in an end-to-end manner. Formally, the weights of TopLoRA can be expressed as $B\Sigma_X A$, where $A$ and $B$ are low-rank matrices (as in standard LoRA), and $\Sigma_X$ is a diagonal matrix generated from each input token $X$. Notably, TopLoRA does not increase the rank of LoRA weights but achieves more granular adaptation by learning token-wise LoRA weights (i.e., token-wise input-output projections). Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that TopLoRA consistently outperforms LoRA and its variants.

Compared to modular and aligned MLLMs, native MLLMs preserve richer paralinguistic features such as emotion and prosody, and generate speech responses directly within the backbone LLM rather than using a separate speech decoder. This integration also results in lower response latency and smoother interaction. However, native MLLMs suffer from catastrophic forgetting and performance degradation because the available paired speech-text data is insufficient to support the pretraining of MLLMs compared to the vast amount of text data required to pretrain text LLMs. To address this issue, we propose DeepTalk, a framework for adaptive modality expert learning based on a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. DeepTalk first adaptively distinguishes modality experts according to their modality load within the LLM. Each modality expert then undergoes specialized single-modality training, followed by joint multimodal collaborative training. As a result, DeepTalk incurs only a 5.5% performance drop compared to the original LLM, which is significantly lower than the average performance drop of over 20% typically seen in native MLLMs (such as GLM-4-Voice), and is on par with modular MLLMs. Meanwhile, the end-to-end dialogue latency remains within 0.5 seconds, ensuring a seamless and intelligent speech interaction experience.

| **[COUNTDOWN: Contextually Sparse Activation Filtering Out Unnecessary Weights in Down Projection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17701v3)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing size of large language models has created significant computational inefficiencies. To address this challenge, sparse activation methods selectively deactivates non-essential parameters during inference, reducing computational costs in FFNN layers. While existing methods focus on non-linear gating mechanisms, we hypothesize that the sparsity of the FFNN layer lies globally in the form of a linear combination over its internal down projection matrix. Based on this insight, we propose two methods: M-COUNTDOWN, leveraging indirect coefficients, and D-COUNTDOWN, utilizing direct coefficients of the linear combination. Experimental results demonstrate that D-COUNTDOWN can omit 90% of computations with performance loss as low as 5.5% ideally, while M-COUNTDOWN provides a predictor-free solution with up to 29.4% better performance preservation compared to existing methods. Our specialized kernel implementations effectively realize these theoretical gains into substantial real-world acceleration.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 (Main Track)</p></details> |
| **[Leveraging Hierarchical Organization for Medical Multi-document Summarization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23104v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical multi-document summarization (MDS) is a complex task that requires effectively managing cross-document relationships. This paper investigates whether incorporating hierarchical structures in the inputs of MDS can improve a model's ability to organize and contextualize information across documents compared to traditional flat summarization methods. We investigate two ways of incorporating hierarchical organization across three large language models (LLMs), and conduct comprehensive evaluations of the resulting summaries using automated metrics, model-based metrics, and domain expert evaluation of preference, understandability, clarity, complexity, relevance, coverage, factuality, and coherence. Our results show that human experts prefer model-generated summaries over human-written summaries. Hierarchical approaches generally preserve factuality, coverage, and coherence of information, while also increasing human preference for summaries. Additionally, we examine whether simulated judgments from GPT-4 align with human judgments, finding higher agreement along more objective evaluation facets. Our findings demonstrate that hierarchical structures can improve the clarity of medical summaries generated by models while maintaining content coverage, providing a practical way to improve human preference for generated summaries.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Imprecise Distance Metrics: LLM-Predicted Target Call Stacks for Directed Greybox Fuzzing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23101v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Directed greybox fuzzing (DGF) aims to efficiently trigger bugs at specific target locations by prioritizing seeds whose execution paths are more likely to mutate into triggering target bugs. However, existing DGF approaches suffer from imprecise probability calculations due to their reliance on complex distance metrics derived from static analysis. The over-approximations inherent in static analysis cause a large number of irrelevant execution paths to be mistakenly considered to potentially mutate into triggering target bugs, significantly reducing fuzzing efficiency. We propose to replace static analysis-based distance metrics with precise call stack representations. Call stacks represent precise control flows, thereby avoiding false information in static analysis. We leverage large language models (LLMs) to predict vulnerability-triggering call stacks for guiding seed prioritization. Our approach constructs call graphs through static analysis to identify methods that can potentially reach target locations, then utilizes LLMs to predict the most likely call stack sequence that triggers the vulnerability. Seeds whose execution paths have higher overlap with the predicted call stack are prioritized for mutation. This is the first work to integrate LLMs into the core seed prioritization mechanism of DGF. We implement our approach and evaluate it against several state-of-the-art fuzzers. On a suite of real-world programs, our approach triggers vulnerabilities $1.86\times$ to $3.09\times$ faster compared to baselines. In addition, our approach identifies 10 new vulnerabilities and 2 incomplete fixes in the latest versions of programs used in our controlled experiments through directed patch testing, with 10 assigned CVE IDs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under submission</p></details> |

As a common data structure in many real-world domains, understanding graph data is a crucial part of advancing general intelligence. To this end, we propose a dynamic benchmark named GraphInstruct in this paper, which comprehensively includes 21 classical graph reasoning tasks, providing diverse graph generation pipelines and detailed intermediate reasoning steps for each sample. Based on GraphInstruct, we develop GraphSolver via efficient instruction-tuning, which demonstrates prominent graph understanding capability compared to other open-sourced LLMs. To further endow LLMs with multi-step graph reasoning capability, we propose a label-mask training strategy and build GraphSolver+, which leverages masked supervision on intermediate reasoning tokens to emphasize crucial node-identification signals. As one of the pioneering efforts to enhance the graph understanding and reasoning abilities of LLMs, extensive experiments have demonstrated the superiority of GraphSolver and GraphSolver+ over other LLMs. We sincerely hope GraphInstruct will facilitate further research on applying LLMs to graph-structured data.

However, existing multimodal approaches often overlook the distinct statistical properties and temporal dependencies that are fundamental to time-series data. To bridge this gap, we propose MAP4TS, a novel Multi-Aspect Prompting Framework that explicitly incorporates classical time-series analysis into the prompt design. Our framework introduces four specialized prompt components: a Global Domain Prompt that conveys dataset-level context, a Local Domain Prompt that encodes recent trends and series-specific behaviors, and a pair of Statistical and Temporal Prompts that embed handcrafted insights derived from autocorrelation (ACF), partial autocorrelation (PACF), and Fourier analysis. Multi-Aspect Prompts are combined with raw time-series embeddings and passed through a cross-modality alignment module to produce unified representations, which are then processed by an LLM and projected for final forecasting. Extensive experiments across eight diverse datasets show that MAP4TS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based methods. Our ablation studies further reveal that prompt-aware designs significantly enhance performance stability and that GPT-2 backbones, when paired with structured prompts, outperform larger models like LLaMA in long-term forecasting tasks.</p></details> |  |

While DPO establishes an offline paradigm with single hyperparameter $\beta$, subsequent methods like SimPO reintroduce complexity through dual parameters ($\beta$, $\gamma$). We propose {ReLU-based Preference Optimization (RePO)}, a streamlined algorithm that eliminates $\beta$ via two advances: (1) retaining SimPO's reference-free margins but removing $\beta$ through gradient analysis, and (2) adopting a ReLU-based max-margin loss that naturally filters trivial pairs. Theoretically, RePO is characterized as SimPO's limiting case ($\beta \to \infty$), where the logistic weighting collapses to binary thresholding, forming a convex envelope of the 0-1 loss. Empirical results on AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard show that RePO outperforms DPO and SimPO across multiple base models, requiring only one hyperparameter to tune.</p></details> |  |

We conducted a systematic review of 270 studies, combining text embeddings, unsupervised clustering and topic modeling to build a computational taxonomy. Three domains emerge organically across the reviewed literature. LLM as Social Minds examines whether and when models display behaviors that elicit attributions of cognition, morality and bias, while addressing challenges such as test leakage and surface cues. LLM Societies examines multi-agent settings where interaction protocols, architectures and mechanism design shape coordination, norms, institutions and collective epistemic processes. LLM-Human Interactions examines how LLMs reshape tasks, learning, trust, work and governance, and how risks arise at the human-AI interface. This taxonomy provides a reproducible map of a fragmented field, clarifies evidentiary standards across levels of analysis, and highlights opportunities for cumulative progress in the social science of artificial intelligence.</p></details> |  |

For the evolution of reasoning models on this task, reward models are a necessary intermediate step. These models judge outcomes or intermediate steps. Decoder-only transformer models can be turned into reward models by introducing a regression layer and supervised fine-tuning. While it is known that reflection capabilities generally increase with the size of a model, we want to investigate whether state-of-the-art small language models like the Phi-4 family can be turned into usable reward models blending the consideration of process rewards and outcome rewards. Targeting this goal, we construct a dataset of code samples with correctness labels derived from the APPS coding challenge benchmark. We then train a value-head model to estimate the success probability of intermediate outputs. Our evaluation shows that small LLMs are capable of serving as effective reward models or code evaluation critics, successfully identifying correct solutions among multiple candidates. Using this critic, we achieve over a 20% improvement in the search capability of the most accurate code out of multiple generations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and to be presented at NeurIPS 2025 Workshop: Foundations of Reasoning in Language Models</p></details> |

Mid-training is distinguished by its use of intermediate data and computational resources, systematically enhancing specified capabilities such as mathematics, coding, reasoning, and long-context extension, while maintaining foundational competencies. This survey provides a formal definition of mid-training for large language models (LLMs) and investigates optimization frameworks that encompass data curation, training strategies, and model architecture optimization. We analyze mainstream model implementations in the context of objective-driven interventions, illustrating how mid-training serves as a distinct and critical stage in the progressive development of LLM capabilities. By clarifying the unique contributions of mid-training, this survey offers a comprehensive taxonomy and actionable insights, supporting future research and innovation in the advancement of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Prior work in this context has mostly focused on generation and relied on benchmarks derived from open-domain sources, most notably Wikipedia. In such settings, retrieval challenges often remain hidden due to language imbalances, overlap with pretraining data, and memorized content. To address this gap, we study Arabic-English RAG in a domain-specific setting using benchmarks derived from real-world corporate datasets. Our benchmarks include all combinations of languages for the user query and the supporting document, drawn independently and uniformly at random. This enables a systematic study of multilingual retrieval behavior. Our findings reveal that retrieval is a critical bottleneck in cross-lingual domain-specific scenarios, with substantial performance drops occurring when the user query and supporting document languages differ. A key insight is that these failures stem primarily from the retriever's difficulty in ranking documents across languages. Finally, we propose two simple retrieval strategies that address this source of failure by enforcing equal retrieval from both languages or by translating the query, resulting in substantial improvements in cross-lingual and overall performance. These results highlight meaningful opportunities for improving multilingual retrieval, particularly in practical, real-world RAG applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ArabicNLP 2025</p></details> |

However, poor translation quality degrades response generation performance. Existing approaches either assume sufficient translation quality or utilize the rewriting method, which introduces factual distortion and hallucinations. To mitigate these problems, we propose Quality-Aware Translation Tagging in mRAG (QTT-RAG), which explicitly evaluates translation quality along three dimensions-semantic equivalence, grammatical accuracy, and naturalness&fluency-and attach these scores as metadata without altering the original content. We evaluate QTT-RAG against CrossRAG and DKM-RAG as baselines in two open-domain QA benchmarks (XORQA, MKQA) using six instruction-tuned LLMs ranging from 2.4B to 14B parameters, covering two low-resource languages (Korean and Finnish) and one high-resource language (Chinese). QTT-RAG outperforms the baselines by preserving factual integrity while enabling generator models to make informed decisions based on translation reliability. This approach allows for effective usage of cross-lingual documents in low-resource settings with limited native language documents, offering a practical and robust solution across multilingual domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 MRL Workshop</p></details> |

Accurate family identification can greatly facilitate automated sample labeling and understanding on crowdsourced malware analysis platforms such as VirusTotal and MalwareBazaar, which generate vast amounts of data daily. In this paper, we explore and assess the feasibility of using traditional binary string features for family classification in the new era of large language models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Specifically, we investigate howFamily-Specific String (FSS) features can be utilized in a manner similar to RAG to facilitate family classification. To this end, we develop a curated evaluation framework covering 4,347 samples from 67 malware families, extract and analyze over 25 million strings, and conduct detailed ablation studies to assess the impact of different design choices in four major modules, with each providing a relative improvement ranging from 8.1% to 120%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a technical report from Lingnan University, Hong Kong.

A Fact-Checking Dataset for Evaluating the Robustness of RAG Against Misleading Retrievals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16101v3)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has shown impressive capabilities in mitigating hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs struggle to maintain consistent reasoning when exposed to misleading or conflicting evidence, especially in real-world domains such as politics, where information is polarized or selectively framed. Mainstream RAG benchmarks evaluate models under clean retrieval settings, where systems generate answers from gold-standard documents, or under synthetically perturbed settings, where documents are artificially injected with noise. These assumptions fail to reflect real-world conditions, often leading to an overestimation of RAG system performance. To address this gap, we introduce RAGuard, the first benchmark to evaluate the robustness of RAG systems against misleading retrievals. Unlike prior benchmarks that rely on synthetic noise, our fact-checking dataset captures naturally occurring misinformation by constructing its retrieval corpus from Reddit discussions. It categorizes retrieved evidence into three types: supporting, misleading, and unrelated, providing a realistic and challenging testbed for assessing how well RAG systems navigate different types of evidence. Our experiments reveal that, when exposed to potentially misleading retrievals, all tested LLM-powered RAG systems perform worse than their zero-shot baselines (i.e., no retrieval at all), while human annotators consistently perform better, highlighting LLMs' susceptibility to noisy environments. To our knowledge, RAGuard is the first benchmark to systematically assess the robustness of the RAG against misleading evidence. We expect this benchmark to drive future research toward improving RAG systems beyond idealized datasets, making them more reliable for real-world applications. The dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/UCSC-IRKM/RAGuard.</p></details> | <details><summary>Advan...</summary><p>Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

Maximising attacker engagement is essential to their utility. However research has highlighted that context-awareness, such as the ability to respond to new attack types, systems and attacker agents, is necessary to increase engagement. Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown as one approach to increase context awareness but suffer from several challenges including accuracy and timeliness of response time, high operational costs and data-protection issues due to cloud deployment. We propose the System-Based Attention Shell Honeypot (SBASH) framework which manages data-protection issues through the use of lightweight local LLMs. We investigate the use of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) supported LLMs and non-RAG LLMs for Linux shell commands and evaluate them using several different metrics such as response time differences, realism from human testers, and similarity to a real system calculated with Levenshtein distance, SBert, and BertScore. We show that RAG improves accuracy for untuned models while models that have been tuned via a system prompt that tells the LLM to respond like a Linux system achieve without RAG a similar accuracy as untuned with RAG, while having a slightly lower latency.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in: The 3rd International Conference on Foundation and Large Language Models (FLLM2025), IEEE, 2025</p></details> |

However, this broad-view approach often lacks the deep structured reasoning needed for complex multi-hop question answering (QA), leading to incomplete evidence and error accumulation. To address these limitations, we propose SubQRAG, a sub-question-driven framework that enhances reasoning depth. SubQRAG decomposes a complex question into an ordered chain of verifiable sub-questions. For each sub-question, it retrieves relevant triples from the graph. When the existing graph is insufficient, the system dynamically expands it by extracting new triples from source documents in real time. All triples used in the reasoning process are aggregated into a "graph memory," forming a structured and traceable evidence path for final answer generation. Experiments on three multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that SubQRAG achieves consistent and significant improvements, especially in Exact Match scores.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 figure |

However, these state-of-the-art-performance is predominantly in English language. To address this gap we made an effort of bridging language gaps by incorporating Adaptive RAG system to Indonesian language. Adaptive RAG system integrates a classifier whose task is to distinguish the question complexity, which in turn determines the strategy for answering the question. To overcome the limited availability of Indonesian language dataset, our study employs machine translation as data augmentation approach. Experiments show reliable question complexity classifier; however, we observed significant inconsistencies in multi-retrieval answering strategy which negatively impacted the overall evaluation when this strategy was applied. These findings highlight both the promise and challenges of question answering in low-resource language suggesting directions for future improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Using two complementary tasks from Long Code Arena -- code completion and bug localization -- we systematically compare retrieval configurations across various context window sizes along three axes: (i) chunking strategy, (ii) similarity scoring, and (iii) splitting granularity. (1) For PL-PL, sparse BM25 with word-level splitting is the most effective and practical, significantly outperforming dense alternatives while being an order of magnitude faster. (2) For NL-PL, proprietary dense encoders (Voyager-3 family) consistently beat sparse retrievers, however requiring 100x larger latency. (3) Optimal chunk size scales with available context: 32-64 line chunks work best at small budgets, and whole-file retrieval becomes competitive at 16000 tokens. (4) Simple line-based chunking matches syntax-aware splitting across budgets. (5) Retrieval latency varies by up to 200x across configurations; BPE-based splitting is needlessly slow, and BM25 + word splitting offers the best quality-latency trade-off. Thus, we provide evidence-based recommendations for implementing effective code-oriented RAG systems based on task requirements, model constraints, and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, the introduction of external knowledge bases presents RAG with challenges in long-context processing, significantly increasing memory consumption and inference latency. Existing research accelerates inference by precomputing Key and Value (KV) of the knowledge base and loading them on-demand during inference. Based on the access frequency of different KV chunks within the external knowledge base, this paper proposes a hotness-aware RAG (HA-RAG) inference optimization system. First, leveraging the numerical distribution of KV chunks, we introduce a hotness-aware mixed-precision compressing and loading method to reduce disk I/O and memory access overhead. Second, we design a hotness-aware data placement strategy that prioritizes storing frequently accessed KV chunks in high-speed memory to improve data access efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with TurboRAG, the proposed HA-RAG achieves an average speedup of 2.10x and maximum speedup of 10.49x in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) with negligible accuracy loss.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages,16 figures,2 tables</p></details> |

Although previous studies noted that retrieving many documents can degrade performance, they did not isolate how the quantity of documents affects performance while controlling for context length. We evaluate various language models on custom datasets derived from a multi-hop QA task. We keep the context length and position of relevant information constant while varying the number of documents, and find that increasing the document count in RAG settings poses significant challenges for most LLMs, reducing performance by up to 20%. However, Qwen2.5 maintained consistent results across increasing document counts, indicating better multi-document handling capability. Finally, our results indicate that processing multiple documents is a separate challenge from handling long contexts.

By integrating documents retrieved from a database into the prompt of a large language model (LLM), RAG enables more reliable and informative content generation. While there has been extensive research on vector databases, many open research problems remain once they are considered in the wider context of end-to-end RAG pipelines. One practical yet challenging problem is how to jointly optimize both system performance and generation quality in RAG, which is significantly more complex than it appears due to the numerous knobs on both the algorithmic side (spanning models and databases) and the systems side (from software to hardware). In this paper, we present RAG-Stack, a three-pillar blueprint for quality-performance co-optimization in RAG systems. RAG-Stack comprises: (1) RAG-IR, an intermediate representation that serves as an abstraction layer to decouple quality and performance aspects; (2) RAG-CM, a cost model for estimating system performance given an RAG-IR; and (3) RAG-PE, a plan exploration algorithm that searches for high-quality, high-performance RAG configurations. We believe this three-pillar blueprint will become the de facto paradigm for RAG quality-performance co-optimization in the years to come.</p></details> |  |

However, the dynamic nature of user interests and content poses a significant challenge: While initial fine-tuning aligns LLMs with domain knowledge and user preferences, it fails to capture such real-time changes, necessitating robust update mechanisms. This paper investigates strategies for updating LLM-powered recommenders, focusing on the trade-offs between ongoing fine-tuning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Using an LLM-powered user interest exploration system as a case study, we perform a comparative analysis of these methods across dimensions like cost, agility, and knowledge incorporation. We propose a hybrid update strategy that leverages the long-term knowledge adaptation of periodic fine-tuning with the agility of low-cost RAG. We demonstrate through live A/B experiments on a billion-user platform that this hybrid approach yields statistically significant improvements in user satisfaction, offering a practical and cost-effective framework for maintaining high-quality LLM-powered recommender systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>RecSy...</summary><p>RecSys 2025 Industry Track</p></details> |

Rather than explaining model internals, outputs are gated ex-ante and bound to cryptographically verifiable evidence for each material answer. Unvalidated targets are stated (>=20% relative reduction in confident errors; p95 latency <= 900 ms; <= 2.2x serve cost) together with a pre-registered (optional) pilot using NO-GO gates. The design complements existing RAG/guardrails by making policy checks auditable, replayable, and receipt-backed. Target domains include back-office compliance in pharma, medical devices, finance, legal, and the public sector where error costs may exceed thousands of euros and audit trails are mandatory under regulations such as the EU AI Act.

They often regenerate predictable token sequences at every step and rely on stochastic stopping, leading to excessive token usage and unstable termination. We propose TSSS (Think Straight, Stop Smart), a structured multi-hop RAG framework designed for efficiency. TSSS introduces (i) a template-based reasoning that caches recurring prefixes and anchors sub-queries to the main question, reducing token generation cost while promoting stable reasoning, and (ii) a retriever-based terminator, which deterministically halts reasoning once additional sub-queries collapse into repetition. This separation of structured reasoning and termination control enables both faster inference and more reliable answers.

| **[Is Implicit Knowledge Enough for LLMs? A RAG Approach for Tree-based Structures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10806v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are adept at generating responses based on information within their context. While this ability is useful for interacting with structured data like code files, another popular method, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), retrieves relevant documents to augment the model's in-context learning. However, it is not well-explored how to best represent this retrieved knowledge for generating responses on structured data, particularly hierarchical structures like trees. In this work, we propose a novel bottom-up method to linearize knowledge from tree-like structures (like a GitHub repository) by generating implicit, aggregated summaries at each hierarchical level. This approach enables the knowledge to be stored in a knowledge base and used directly with RAG. We then compare our method to using RAG on raw, unstructured code, evaluating the accuracy and quality of the generated responses. Our results show that while response quality is comparable across both methods, our approach generates over 68% fewer documents in the retriever, a significant gain in efficiency. This finding suggests that leveraging implicit, linearized knowledge may be a highly effective and scalable strategy for handling complex, hierarchical data structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Waiti...</summary><p>Waiting for Conference Response</p></details> |
| **[Query Decomposition for RAG: Balancing Exploration-Exploitation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18633v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems address complex user requests by decomposing them into subqueries, retrieving potentially relevant documents for each, and then aggregating them to generate an answer. Efficiently selecting informative documents requires balancing a key trade-off: (i) retrieving broadly enough to capture all the relevant material, and (ii) limiting retrieval to avoid excessive noise and computational cost. We formulate query decomposition and document retrieval in an exploitation-exploration setting, where retrieving one document at a time builds a belief about the utility of a given sub-query and informs the decision to continue exploiting or exploring an alternative. We experiment with a variety of bandit learning methods and demonstrate their effectiveness in dynamically selecting the most informative sub-queries. Our main finding is that estimating document relevance using rank information and human judgments yields a 35% gain in document-level precision, 15% increase in {\alpha}-nDCG, and better performance on the downstream task of long-form generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can we Evaluate RAGs with Synthetic Data?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11758v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate whether synthetic question-answer (QA) data generated by large language models (LLMs) can serve as an effective proxy for human-labeled benchmarks when the latter is unavailable. We assess the reliability of synthetic benchmarks across two experiments: one varying retriever parameters while keeping the generator fixed, and another varying the generator with fixed retriever parameters. Across four datasets, of which two open-domain and two proprietary, we find that synthetic benchmarks reliably rank the RAGs varying in terms of retriever configuration, aligning well with human-labeled benchmark baselines. However, they do not consistently produce reliable RAG rankings when comparing generator architectures. The breakdown possibly arises from a combination of task mismatch between the synthetic and human benchmarks, and stylistic bias favoring certain generators.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for the SynDAiTE workshop at the European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML-PKDD 2025), September 15, 2025 - Porto, Portugal</p></details> |
| **[ChronoPlay: A Framework for Modeling Dual Dynamics and Authenticity in Game RAG Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18455v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are increasingly vital in dynamic domains like online gaming, yet the lack of a dedicated benchmark has impeded standardized evaluation in this area. The core difficulty lies in Dual Dynamics: the constant interplay between game content updates and the shifting focus of the player community. Furthermore, the necessity of automating such a benchmark introduces a critical requirement for player-centric authenticity to ensure generated questions are realistic. To address this integrated challenge, we introduce ChronoPlay, a novel framework for the automated and continuous generation of game RAG benchmarks. ChronoPlay utilizes a dual-dynamic update mechanism to track both forms of change, and a dual-source synthesis engine that draws from official sources and player community to ensure both factual correctness and authentic query patterns. We instantiate our framework on three distinct games to create the first dynamic RAG benchmark for the gaming domain, offering new insights into model performance under these complex and realistic conditions. Code is avaliable at: https://github.com/hly1998/ChronoPlay.</p></details> |  |
| **[KG-Infused RAG: Augmenting Corpus-Based RAG with External Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09542v2)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves factual accuracy by grounding responses in external knowledge. However, existing RAG methods either rely solely on text corpora and neglect structural knowledge, or build ad-hoc knowledge graphs (KGs) at high cost and low reliability. To address these issues, we propose KG-Infused RAG, a framework that incorporates pre-existing large-scale KGs into RAG and applies spreading activation to enhance both retrieval and generation. KG-Infused RAG directly performs spreading activation over external KGs to retrieve relevant structured knowledge, which is then used to expand queries and integrated with corpus passages, enabling interpretable and semantically grounded multi-source retrieval. We further improve KG-Infused RAG through preference learning on sampled key stages of the pipeline. Experiments on five QA benchmarks show that KG-Infused RAG consistently outperforms vanilla RAG (by 3.9% to 17.8%). Compared with KG-based approaches such as GraphRAG and LightRAG, our method obtains structured knowledge at lower cost while achieving superior performance. Additionally, integrating KG-Infused RAG with Self-RAG and DeepNote yields further gains, demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility as a plug-and-play enhancement module for corpus-based RAG methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAG vs. GraphRAG: A Systematic Evaluation and Key Insights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11371v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the performance of LLMs across various tasks by retrieving relevant information from external sources, particularly on text-based data. For structured data, such as knowledge graphs, GraphRAG has been widely used to retrieve relevant information. However, recent studies have revealed that structuring implicit knowledge from text into graphs can benefit certain tasks, extending the application of GraphRAG from graph data to general text-based data. Despite their successful extensions, most applications of GraphRAG for text data have been designed for specific tasks and datasets, lacking a systematic evaluation and comparison between RAG and GraphRAG on widely used text-based benchmarks. In this paper, we systematically evaluate RAG and GraphRAG on well-established benchmark tasks, such as Question Answering and Query-based Summarization. Our results highlight the distinct strengths of RAG and GraphRAG across different tasks and evaluation perspectives. Inspired by these observations, we investigate strategies to integrate their strengths to improve downstream tasks. Additionally, we provide an in-depth discussion of the shortcomings of current GraphRAG approaches and outline directions for future research.</p></details> |  |

However, their effectiveness with image-based queries is limited, as general Vision-Language Model captions often lack clinical specificity and factual grounding. This study proposes and validates a framework to specialize the MedGemma model for generating high-fidelity captions that serve as superior queries. To overcome data scarcity, we employ a knowledge distillation pipeline to create a synthetic dataset across dermatology, fundus, and chest radiography domains, and fine-tune MedGemma using the parameter-efficient QLoRA method. Performance was rigorously assessed through a dual framework measuring both classification accuracy and, via a novel application of the RAGAS framework, caption faithfulness, relevancy, and correctness. The fine-tuned model demonstrated substantial improvements in classification performance, while RAGAS evaluation confirmed significant gains in caption faithfulness and correctness, validating the models ability to produce reliable, factually grounded descriptions. This work establishes a robust pipeline for specializing medical VLMs and validates the resulting model as a high-quality query generator, laying the groundwork for enhancing multimodal RAG systems in evidence-based clinical decision support.</p></details> |  |
| **[Repairing Tool Calls Using Post-tool Execution Reflection and RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17874v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic systems interact with external systems by calling tools such as Python functions, REST API endpoints, or command line tools such as kubectl in Kubernetes. These tool calls often fail for various syntactic and semantic reasons. Some less obvious semantic errors can only be identified and resolved after analyzing the tool's response. To repair these errors, we develop a post-tool execution reflection component that combines large language model (LLM)-based reflection with domain-specific retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) using documents describing both the specific tool being called and troubleshooting documents related to the tool. For this paper, we focus on the use case of the kubectl command line tool to manage Kubernetes, a platform for orchestrating cluster applications. Through a larger empirical study and a smaller manual evaluation, we find that our RAG-based reflection will repair kubectl commands such that they are both more likely to successfully execute (pass rate) for 55% of our models evaluated and 36% more likely to correctly answer the user query on average. We find that troubleshooting documents improve pass rate compared to official documentation by an average of 10%.</p></details> |  |
| **[METIS: Fast Quality-Aware RAG Systems with Configuration Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10543v3)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) allows LLMs (large language models) to generate better responses with external knowledge, but using more external knowledge often improves generation quality at the expense of response delay. Prior work either reduces the response delay (through better scheduling of RAG queries) or strives to maximize quality (which involves tuning the RAG workflow), but they fall short in optimizing the tradeoff between the delay and quality of RAG responses. This paper presents METIS, the first RAG system that jointly schedules queries and adapts the key RAG configurations of each query, such as the number of retrieved text chunks and synthesis methods, in order to balance quality optimization and response delay reduction. Using 4 popular RAG-QA datasets, we show that compared with the state-of-the-art RAG optimization schemes, METIS reduces the generation latency by $1.64-2.54\times$ without sacrificing generation quality.</p></details> | 17 pages, 18 figures |
| **[Unmasking Hiring Bias: Platform Data Analysis and Controlled Experiments on Bias in Online Freelance Marketplaces via RAG-LLM Generated Contents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13091v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online freelance marketplaces, a rapidly growing part of the global labor market, are creating a fair environment where professional skills are the main factor for hiring. While these platforms can reduce bias from traditional hiring, the personal information in user profiles raises concerns about ongoing discrimination. Past studies on this topic have mostly used existing data, which makes it hard to control for other factors and clearly see the effect of things like gender or race. To solve these problems, this paper presents a new method that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a Large Language Model (LLM) to create realistic, artificial freelancer profiles for controlled experiments. This approach effectively separates individual factors, enabling a clearer statistical analysis of how different variables influence the freelancer project process. In addition to analyzing extracted data with traditional statistical methods for post-project stage analysis, our research utilizes a dataset with highly controlled variables, generated by an RAG-LLM, to conduct a simulated hiring experiment for pre-project stage analysis. The results of our experiments show that, regarding gender, while no significant preference emerged in initial hiring decisions, female freelancers are substantially more likely to receive imperfect ratings post-project stage. Regarding regional bias, a strong and consistent preference favoring US-based freelancers shows that people are more likely to be selected in the simulated experiments, perceived as more leader-like, and receive higher ratings on the live platform.</p></details> |  |
| **[EviNote-RAG: Enhancing RAG Models via Answer-Supportive Evidence Notes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00877v3)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has advanced open-domain question answering by incorporating external information into model reasoning. However, effectively leveraging external information to enhance reasoning presents the following challenges: (1) low signal-to-noise ratio, where answer-supportive external information is diluted by irrelevant material, and (2) error accumulation, which arises in multi-hop reasoning when incomplete or misleading information is incorporated. To address these challenges, we introduce EviNote-RAG, a framework that follows a retrieve-note-answer workflow. Instead of reasoning directly over raw external information, the model first produces Supportive-Evidence Notes (SENs), which concisely preserve answer-critical information and explicitly mark key and uncertainty information to improve accuracy. We further design an entailment-based Evidence Quality Reward (EQR) to ensure that SENs are logically sufficient to derive the final answer, thereby enhancing SENs' quality. Experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain QA benchmarks show that EviNote-RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving answer accuracy, training stability, robustness, and efficiency. In particular, it yields relative F1 gains of 20% on HotpotQA (+0.093), 40% on Bamboogle (+0.151), and 91% on 2Wiki (+0.256), benefiting from improvements in the reasoning process.</p></details> |  |

Such documents often combine text, images, tables, equations, and graphs, each contributing unique information. In this work, we present a Modality-Aware Hybrid retrieval Architecture (MAHA), designed specifically for multimodal question answering with reasoning through a modality-aware knowledge graph. MAHA integrates dense vector retrieval with structured graph traversal, where the knowledge graph encodes cross-modal semantics and relationships. This design enables both semantically rich and context-aware retrieval across diverse modalities. Evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that MAHA substantially outperforms baseline methods, achieving a ROUGE-L score of 0.486, providing complete modality coverage. These results highlight MAHA's ability to combine embeddings with explicit document structure, enabling effective multimodal retrieval. Our work establishes a scalable and interpretable retrieval framework that advances RAG systems by enabling modality-aware reasoning over unstructured multimodal data.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, submitted for review</p></details> |

Nevertheless, existing methods often struggle to achieve effective synergy between system effectiveness and cost efficiency, leading to neither unsatisfying performance nor excessive LLM prompt tokens and inference time. To this end, this paper proposes REMINDRAG, which employs an LLM-guided graph traversal featuring node exploration, node exploitation, and, most notably, memory replay, to improve both system effectiveness and cost efficiency. Specifically, REMINDRAG memorizes traversal experience within KG edge embeddings, mirroring the way LLMs "memorize" world knowledge within their parameters, but in a train-free manner. We theoretically and experimentally confirm the effectiveness of REMINDRAG, demonstrating its superiority over existing baselines across various benchmark datasets and LLM backbones.

Existing methods either use a predetermined number of iterations or rely on confidence proxies that poorly reflect whether more retrieval will actually help. We cast iterative RAG as a finite-horizon Markov decision process and introduce Stop-RAG, a value-based controller that adaptively decides when to stop retrieving. Trained with full-width forward-view Q($\lambda$) targets from complete trajectories, Stop-RAG learns effective stopping policies while remaining compatible with black-box APIs and existing pipelines. On multi-hop question-answering benchmarks, Stop-RAG consistently outperforms both fixed-iteration baselines and prompting-based stopping with LLMs. These results highlight adaptive stopping as a key missing component in current agentic systems, and demonstrate that value-based control can improve the accuracy of RAG systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 MTI-LLM Workshop</p></details> |

Although current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enrich LLMs with external knowledge, they largely ignore this temporal nature. This raises two challenges for RAG. First, current RAG methods lack effective time-aware representations. Same facts of different time are difficult to distinguish with vector embeddings or conventional knowledge graphs. Second, most RAG evaluations assume a static corpus, leaving a blind spot regarding update costs and retrieval stability as knowledge evolves. To make RAG time-aware, we propose Temporal GraphRAG (TG-RAG), which models external corpora as a bi-level temporal graph consisting of a temporal knowledge graph with timestamped relations and a hierarchical time graph. Multi-granularity temporal summaries are generated for each time node to capture both key events and broader trends at that time. The design supports incremental updates by extracting new temporal facts from the incoming corpus and merging them into the existing graph. The temporal graph explicitly represents identical facts at different times as distinct edges to avoid ambiguity, and the time hierarchy graph allows only generating reports for new leaf time nodes and their ancestors, ensuring effective and efficient updates. During inference, TG-RAG dynamically retrieves a subgraph within the temporal and semantic scope of the query, enabling precise evidence gathering. Moreover, we introduce ECT-QA, a time-sensitive question-answering dataset featuring both specific and abstract queries, along with a comprehensive evaluation protocol designed to assess incremental update capabilities of RAG systems. Extensive experiments show that TG-RAG significantly outperforms existing baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in handling temporal knowledge and incremental updates.</p></details> |  |
| **[SeCon-RAG: A Two-Stage Semantic Filtering and Conflict-Free Framework for Trustworthy RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09710v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems enhance large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge but are vulnerable to corpus poisoning and contamination attacks, which can compromise output integrity. Existing defenses often apply aggressive filtering, leading to unnecessary loss of valuable information and reduced reliability in generation. To address this problem, we propose a two-stage semantic filtering and conflict-free framework for trustworthy RAG. In the first stage, we perform a joint filter with semantic and cluster-based filtering which is guided by the Entity-intent-relation extractor (EIRE). EIRE extracts entities, latent objectives, and entity relations from both the user query and filtered documents, scores their semantic relevance, and selectively adds valuable documents into the clean retrieval database. In the second stage, we proposed an EIRE-guided conflict-aware filtering module, which analyzes semantic consistency between the query, candidate answers, and retrieved knowledge before final answer generation, filtering out internal and external contradictions that could mislead the model. Through this two-stage process, SeCon-RAG effectively preserves useful knowledge while mitigating conflict contamination, achieving significant improvements in both generation robustness and output trustworthiness. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and datasets demonstrate that the proposed SeCon-RAG markedly outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[RAG-Anything: All-in-One RAG Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12323v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a fundamental paradigm for expanding Large Language Models beyond their static training limitations. However, a critical misalignment exists between current RAG capabilities and real-world information environments. Modern knowledge repositories are inherently multimodal, containing rich combinations of textual content, visual elements, structured tables, and mathematical expressions. Yet existing RAG frameworks are limited to textual content, creating fundamental gaps when processing multimodal documents. We present RAG-Anything, a unified framework that enables comprehensive knowledge retrieval across all modalities. Our approach reconceptualizes multimodal content as interconnected knowledge entities rather than isolated data types. The framework introduces dual-graph construction to capture both cross-modal relationships and textual semantics within a unified representation. We develop cross-modal hybrid retrieval that combines structural knowledge navigation with semantic matching. This enables effective reasoning over heterogeneous content where relevant evidence spans multiple modalities. RAG-Anything demonstrates superior performance on challenging multimodal benchmarks, achieving significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Performance gains become particularly pronounced on long documents where traditional approaches fail. Our framework establishes a new paradigm for multimodal knowledge access, eliminating the architectural fragmentation that constrains current systems. Our framework is open-sourced at: https://github.com/HKUDS/RAG-Anything.</p></details> |  |

Yet, existing work treats counter-speech generation as pure text generation task, mainly based on Large Language Models or NGO experts. These approaches show severe drawbacks due to the limited reliability and coherence in the generated countering text, and in scalability, respectively. To close this gap, we introduce a novel framework to model counter-speech generation as knowledge-wise text generation process. Our framework integrates advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines to ensure the generation of trustworthy counter-speech for 8 main target groups identified in the hate speech literature, including women, people of colour, persons with disabilities, migrants, Muslims, Jews, LGBT persons, and other. We built a knowledge base over the United Nations Digital Library, EUR-Lex and the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights, comprising a total of 32,792 texts. We use the MultiTarget-CONAN dataset to empirically assess the quality of the generated counter-speech, both through standard metrics (i.e., JudgeLM) and a human evaluation. Results show that our framework outperforms standard LLM baselines and competitive approach, on both assessments. The resulting framework and the knowledge base pave the way for studying trustworthy and sound counter-speech generation, in hate speech and beyond.</p></details> |  |

Yet, RAG-based LLMs still hallucinate even when provided with correct and sufficient context. A growing line of work suggests that this stems from an imbalance between how models use external context and their internal knowledge, and several approaches have attempted to quantify these signals for hallucination detection. However, existing methods require extensive hyperparameter tuning, limiting their generalizability. We propose LUMINA, a novel framework that detects hallucinations in RAG systems through context-knowledge signals: external context utilization is quantified via distributional distance, while internal knowledge utilization is measured by tracking how predicted tokens evolve across transformer layers. We further introduce a framework for statistically validating these measurements. Experiments on common RAG hallucination benchmarks and four open-source LLMs show that LUMINA achieves consistently high AUROC and AUPRC scores, outperforming prior utilization-based methods by up to +13% AUROC on HalluRAG. Moreover, LUMINA remains robust under relaxed assumptions about retrieval quality and model matching, offering both effectiveness and practicality.</p></details> |  |

Several benchmarks have been created to measure the performance of LLMs on this task. We present a longitudinal study comparing the feedback loop of an internal and external human annotator group for the complex annotation task of creating multi-turn RAG conversations for evaluating LLMs. We analyze the conversations produced by both groups and provide results of a survey comparing their experiences. Our study highlights the advantages of each annotator population and the impact of the different feedback loops; a closer loop creates higher quality conversations with a decrease in quantity and diversity. Further, we present guidance for how to best utilize two different population groups when performing annotation tasks, particularly when the task is complex.</p></details> | 26 pages |

Most existing approaches lack transparency in their decision-making and provide limited attribution to credible sources. We introduce FinVet, a novel multi-agent framework that integrates two Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines with external fact-checking through a confidence-weighted voting mechanism. FinVet employs adaptive three-tier processing that dynamically adjusts verification strategies based on retrieval confidence, from direct metadata extraction to hybrid reasoning to full model-based analysis. Unlike existing methods, FinVet provides evidence-backed verdicts, source attribution, confidence scores, and explicit uncertainty flags when evidence is insufficient. Experimental evaluation on the FinFact dataset shows that FinVet achieves an F1 score of 0.85, which is a 10.4% improvement over the best individual pipeline (fact-check pipeline) and 37% improvement over standalone RAG approaches.</p></details> |  |

Effectively adapting RAG systems to domain-specific settings requires specialized, context-rich training data beyond general-purpose question-answering. Here, we propose RAGen, a scalable and modular framework for generating domain-grounded question-answer-context (QAC) triples tailored to diverse RAG adaptation approaches. RAGen produces these QAC triples by identifying key concepts in documents, generating diverse questions guided by Bloom's Taxonomy-inspired principles, and pairing them with precise answers extracted from relevant contexts. RAGen supports multiple RAG adaptation strategies, including the optimization of key components such as the LLM, retriever, and embedding model, etc. Its modular pipeline features semantic chunking, hierarchical concept extraction, and multi-chunk retrieval, along with the introduction of curated distractor contexts to promote robust reasoning. Designed for scalability, RAGen efficiently handles large and evolving document corpora without redundant processing, making it especially suitable for dynamic evolving domains such as scientific research and enterprise knowledge bases.</p></details> |  |

It does so by adding external data into the LLM's context. We develop a new class of black-box attack, RAG-Pull, that inserts hidden UTF characters into queries or external code repositories, redirecting retrieval toward malicious code, thereby breaking the models' safety alignment. We observe that query and code perturbations alone can shift retrieval toward attacker-controlled snippets, while combined query-and-target perturbations achieve near-perfect success. Once retrieved, these snippets introduce exploitable vulnerabilities such as remote code execution and SQL injection. RAG-Pull's minimal perturbations can alter the model's safety alignment and increase preference towards unsafe code, therefore opening up a new class of attacks on LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chronological Passage Assembling in RAG framework for Temporal Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18748v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-context question answering over narrative tasks is challenging because correct answers often hinge on reconstructing a coherent timeline of events while preserving contextual f low in a limited context window. Retrievalaugmented generation (RAG) methods aim to address this challenge by selectively retrieving only necessary document segments. However, narrative texts possess unique characteristics that limit the effectiveness of these existing approaches. Specifically, understanding narrative texts requires more than isolated segments, as the broader context and sequential relationships between segments are crucial for comprehension. To address these limitations, we propose ChronoRAG, a novel RAG framework specialized for narrative texts. This approach focuses on two essential aspects: refining dispersed document information into coherent and structured passages and preserving narrative flow by explicitly capturing and maintaining the temporal order among retrieved passages. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of ChronoRAG through experiments on the NarrativeQA and GutenQAdataset, showing substantial improvements in tasks requiring both factual identification and comprehension of complex sequential relationships, underscoring that reasoning over temporal order is crucial in resolving narrative QA.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |

However, these models can inadvertently learn and retain sensitive information and harmful content during training, raising significant ethical and legal concerns. To address these issues, machine unlearning has been introduced as a potential solution. While existing unlearning methods take into account the specific characteristics of LLMs, they often suffer from high computational demands, limited applicability, or the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address these limitations, we propose a lightweight behavioral unlearning framework based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology. By modifying the external knowledge base of RAG, we simulate the effects of forgetting without directly interacting with the unlearned LLM. We approach the construction of unlearned knowledge as a constrained optimization problem, deriving two key components that underpin the effectiveness of RAG-based unlearning. This RAG-based approach is particularly effective for closed-source LLMs, where existing unlearning methods often fail. We evaluate our framework through extensive experiments on both open-source and closed-source models, including ChatGPT, Gemini, Llama-2-7b-chat, and PaLM 2. The results demonstrate that our approach meets five key unlearning criteria: effectiveness, universality, harmlessness, simplicity, and robustness. Meanwhile, this approach can extend to multimodal large language models and LLM-based agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, 13 tables.

However, existing financial RAG systems face two significant challenges: (1) they struggle to process heterogeneous data formats, such as text, tables, and figures; and (2) they encounter difficulties in balancing general-domain applicability with company-specific adaptation. To overcome these challenges, we present VeritasFi, an innovative hybrid RAG framework that incorporates a multi-modal preprocessing pipeline alongside a cutting-edge two-stage training strategy for its re-ranking component. VeritasFi enhances financial QA through three key innovations: (1) A multi-modal preprocessing pipeline that seamlessly transforms heterogeneous data into a coherent, machine-readable format. (2) A tripartite hybrid retrieval engine that operates in parallel, combining deep multi-path retrieval over a semantically indexed document corpus, real-time data acquisition through tool utilization, and an expert-curated memory bank for high-frequency questions, ensuring comprehensive scope, accuracy, and efficiency.

| **[Review of Inference-Time Scaling Strategies: Reasoning, Search and RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10787v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance gains of LLMs have historically been driven by scaling up model size and training data. However, the rapidly diminishing availability of high-quality training data is introducing a fundamental bottleneck, shifting the focus of research toward inference-time scaling. This paradigm uses additional computation at the time of deployment to substantially improve LLM performance on downstream tasks without costly model re-training. This review systematically surveys the diverse techniques contributing to this new era of inference-time scaling, organizing the rapidly evolving field into two comprehensive perspectives: Output-focused and Input-focused methods. Output-focused techniques encompass complex, multi-step generation strategies, including reasoning (e.g., CoT, ToT, ReAct), various search and decoding methods (e.g., MCTS, beam search), training for long CoT (e.g., RLVR, GRPO), and model ensemble methods. Input-focused techniques are primarily categorized by few-shot and RAG, with RAG as the central focus. The RAG section is further detailed through a structured examination of query expansion, data, retrieval and reranker, LLM generation methods, and multi-modal RAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[REFRAG: Rethinking RAG based Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01092v2)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in leveraging extensive external knowledge to enhance responses in multi-turn and agentic applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, processing long-context inputs introduces significant system latency and demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced throughput and a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system efficiency. While minimizing latency for long-context inputs is a primary objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG require specialized consideration. In RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated passages from retrieval, with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages often exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during re-ranking, leading to block-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those in standard LLM generation tasks. Based on this observation, we argue that most computations over the RAG context during decoding are unnecessary and can be eliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose REFRAG, an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve latency in RAG applications. By exploiting the sparsity structure, we demonstrate a 30.85 the time-to-first-token acceleration (3.75 improvement to previous work) without loss in perplexity. In addition, our optimization framework for large context enables REFRAG to extend the context size of LLMs by 16. We provide rigorous validation of REFRAG across diverse long-context tasks, including RAG, multi-turn conversations, and long document summarization, spanning a wide range of datasets. Experimental results confirm that REFRAG delivers substantial speedup with no loss in accuracy compared to LLaMA models and other state-of-the-art baselines across various context sizes.</p></details> | <details><summary>fix t...</summary><p>fix typo perplexity->log perplexity; added recent papers</p></details> |

We develop a multimodal retrieval model jointly optimized with an LVLM for medical diagnosis, unlike standard RAG which doesn't backpropagate LVLM errors to the retriever. Using only general-purpose backbones with lightweight fine-tuning, our model achieves competitive results with medically-pretrained models on clinical classification and VQA tasks. In a novel analysis, we find that different top-retrieved images often yield different predictions for the same target, and that these cases are challenging for all models, even for non-retrieval models. Our joint retrieval optimization significantly improves these cases over standard RAG. However, oracle analysis reveals that while the correct diagnosis is frequently achievable using one of the top retrieved images, in practice there is a large performance gap from the oracle, and rerankers using frontier LVLMs do not close this gap -- leaving ample room for improvement by future methods.

| **[Can Compact Language Models Search Like Agents? Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization for Preserving Agentic RAG Capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20324v3)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a dominant post-training approach to elicit agentic RAG behaviors such as search and planning from language models. Despite its success with larger models, applying RL to compact models (e.g., 0.5--1B parameters) presents unique challenges. The compact models exhibit poor initial performance, resulting in sparse rewards and unstable training. To overcome these difficulties, we propose Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization (DGPO), which employs cold-start initialization from teacher demonstrations and continuous teacher guidance during policy optimization. To understand how compact models preserve agentic behavior, we introduce Agentic RAG Capabilities (ARC), a fine-grained metric analyzing reasoning, search coordination, and response synthesis. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that DGPO enables compact models to achieve sophisticated agentic search behaviors, even outperforming the larger teacher model in some cases. DGPO makes agentic RAG feasible in computing resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  |

Prior work highlights LLMs' susceptibility to misleading or malicious retrieved content. However, real-world fact-checking scenarios are more challenging, as credible evidence typically dominates the retrieval pool. To investigate this problem, we extend knowledge poisoning to the fact-checking setting, where retrieved context includes authentic supporting or refuting evidence. We propose \textbf{ADMIT} (\textbf{AD}versarial \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{I}njection \textbf{T}echnique), a few-shot, semantically aligned poisoning attack that flips fact-checking decisions and induces deceptive justifications, all without access to the target LLMs, retrievers, or token-level control. Extensive experiments show that ADMIT transfers effectively across 4 retrievers, 11 LLMs, and 4 cross-domain benchmarks, achieving an average attack success rate (ASR) of 86\% at an extremely low poisoning rate of $0.93 \times 10^{-6}$, and remaining robust even in the presence of strong counter-evidence. Compared with prior state-of-the-art attacks, ADMIT improves ASR by 11.2\% across all settings, exposing significant vulnerabilities in real-world RAG-based fact-checking systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[CacheClip: Accelerating RAG with Effective KV Cache Reuse](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10129v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems suffer from severe time-to-first-token (TTFT) bottlenecks due to long input sequences. Existing KV cache reuse methods face a fundamental trade-off: prefix caching requires identical prefixes that rarely occur in RAG scenarios, while direct precomputation sacrifices quality due to missing inter-chunk attention and repeated attention sinks. Recent methods like APE and CacheBlend partially address these issues but remain inadequate for robust RAG applications. This paper presents CacheClip, a novel framework that achieves both fast TTFT and high generation quality. Our key insight is that small auxiliary LLMs exhibit similar last-layer attention distributions to primary LLMs (the target model for generation), enabling efficient identification of tokens critical for restoring inter-chunk attention, thereby significantly improving response quality on cross-chunk reasoning tasks. CacheClip integrates three techniques: (1) auxiliary-model-guided token selection for selective KV cache recomputation, where the auxiliary model is finetuned to improve selection accuracy, (2) shared prefixes to eliminate redundant attention sinks, and (3) grouping strategy to maintain local coherence during partial KV cache updates. Experiments show CacheClip retains up to 94.8% and 85.0% of full-attention performance on NIAH and LongBench, outperforming APE and CacheBlend by 25.2% and 35.1% on NIAH (with reomp% = 20%). Meanwhile, CacheClip accelerates LLM inference by up to 1.92x in prefill time, providing a practical solution to the efficiency-quality trade-off in RAG systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transparent and Robust RAG: Adaptive-Reward Reinforcement Learning for Decision Traceability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13258v2)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) delivers substantial value in knowledge-intensive applications. Many recent works use reinforcement learning (RL) to elicit strong reasoning in RAG generators. However, two key challenges remain unresolved: (1) Transparency: most prior methods do not explicitly indicate which references are actually used during the reasoning that leads to the final answer, limiting interpretability and visibility; (2) Stability: the KL divergence estimator used in existing RL-based approaches may cause gradient spikes, leading to unstable training. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive-Rewarded Evidence Navigation Agent (ARENA), a transparent and robust RAG generator framework trained via RL with designed rewards. Based on our structured protocol, KL divergence stabilization, and adaptive reward calculation modules, ARENA enables the RAG generator to identify key evidence, perform structured reasoning, and generate answers with interpretable decision traces. Applied to Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, extensive experiments across multiple baselines show 10-30% accuracy improvements on three multi-hop QA datasets, comparable to advanced closed-source LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o1, DeepSeek R1). Further analyses show that ARENA generalizes well to unseen datasets and tasks. Our models and codes are publicly released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retrieval is Not Enough: Enhancing RAG Reasoning through Test-Time Critique and Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14858v4)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a widely adopted paradigm for enabling knowledge-grounded large language models (LLMs). However, standard RAG pipelines often fail to ensure that model reasoning remains consistent with the evidence retrieved, leading to factual inconsistencies or unsupported conclusions. In this work, we reinterpret RAG as Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning and identify a central but underexplored problem: Reasoning Misalignment -- the divergence between an LLM's internal reasoning trajectory and the evidential constraints provided by retrieval. To address this issue, we propose AlignRAG, a novel iterative framework grounded in Critique-Driven Alignment (CDA). We further introduce AlignRAG-auto, an autonomous variant that dynamically terminates refinement, removing the need to pre-specify the number of critique iterations. At the heart of AlignRAG lies a contrastive critique synthesis mechanism that generates retrieval-sensitive critiques while mitigating self-bias. This mechanism trains a dedicated retrieval-augmented Critic Language Model (CLM) using labeled critiques that distinguish between evidence-aligned and misaligned reasoning. Empirical evaluations show that our approach significantly improves reasoning fidelity. Our 8B-parameter CLM improves performance over the Self-Refine baseline by 12.1% on out-of-domain tasks and outperforms a standard 72B-parameter CLM by 2.2%. Furthermore, AlignRAG-auto achieves this state-of-the-art performance while dynamically determining the optimal number of refinement steps, enhancing efficiency and usability. AlignRAG remains compatible with existing RAG architectures as a plug-and-play module and demonstrates strong robustness under both informative and noisy retrieval scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Inspired by this mechanism, we introduce EcphoryRAG, an entity-centric knowledge graph RAG framework. During indexing, EcphoryRAG extracts and stores only core entities with corresponding metadata, a lightweight approach that reduces token consumption by up to 94\% compared to other structured RAG systems. For retrieval, the system first extracts cue entities from queries, then performs a scalable multi-hop associative search across the knowledge graph. Crucially, EcphoryRAG dynamically infers implicit relations between entities to populate context, enabling deep reasoning without exhaustive pre-enumeration of relationships. Extensive evaluations on the 2WikiMultiHop, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue benchmarks demonstrate that EcphoryRAG sets a new state-of-the-art, improving the average Exact Match (EM) score from 0.392 to 0.474 over strong KG-RAG methods like HippoRAG. These results validate the efficacy of the entity-cue-multi-hop retrieval paradigm for complex question answering.</p></details> |  |
| **[UNIDOC-BENCH: A Unified Benchmark for Document-Centric Multimodal RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03663v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (MM-RAG) is a key approach for applying large language models (LLMs) and agents to real-world knowledge bases, yet current evaluations are fragmented, focusing on either text or images in isolation or on simplified multimodal setups that fail to capture document-centric multimodal use cases. In this paper, we introduce UniDoc-Bench, the first large-scale, realistic benchmark for MM-RAG built from 70k real-world PDF pages across eight domains. Our pipeline extracts and links evidence from text, tables, and figures, then generates 1,600 multimodal QA pairs spanning factual retrieval, comparison, summarization, and logical reasoning queries. To ensure reliability, 20% of QA pairs are validated by multiple annotators and expert adjudication. UniDoc-Bench supports apples-to-apples comparison across four paradigms: (1) text-only, (2) image-only, (3) multimodal text-image fusion, and (4) multimodal joint retrieval -- under a unified protocol with standardized candidate pools, prompts, and evaluation metrics. Our experiments show that multimodal text-image fusion RAG systems consistently outperform both unimodal and jointly multimodal embedding-based retrieval, indicating that neither text nor images alone are sufficient and that current multimodal embeddings remain inadequate. Beyond benchmarking, our analysis reveals when and how visual context complements textual evidence, uncovers systematic failure modes, and offers actionable guidance for developing more robust MM-RAG pipelines.</p></details> |  |

A Method for Detecting Unauthorized RAG Theft](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07728v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by mitigating hallucinations and outdated information issues, yet simultaneously facilitates unauthorized data appropriation at scale. This paper addresses this challenge through two key contributions. First, we introduce RPD, a novel dataset specifically designed for RAG plagiarism detection that encompasses diverse professional domains and writing styles, overcoming limitations in existing resources. Second, we develop a dual-layered watermarking system that embeds protection at both semantic and lexical levels, complemented by an interrogator-detective framework that employs statistical hypothesis testing on accumulated evidence. Extensive experimentation demonstrates our approach's effectiveness across varying query volumes, defense prompts, and retrieval parameters, while maintaining resilience against adversarial evasion techniques. This work establishes a foundational framework for intellectual property protection in retrieval-augmented AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient and Transferable Agentic Knowledge Graph RAG via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26383v3)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge-graph retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) couples large language models (LLMs) with structured, verifiable knowledge graphs (KGs) to reduce hallucinations and expose reasoning traces. However, many KG-RAG systems compose multiple LLM modules (e.g planning, reasoning, and responding), inflating inference cost and binding behavior to a specific target KG. To address this, we introduce KG-R1, an agentic KG retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) framework through reinforcement learning (RL). KG-R1 utilizes a single agent that interacts with KGs as its environment, learning to retrieve at each step and incorporating the retrieved information into its reasoning and generation. The process is optimized through end-to-end RL. In controlled experiments across Knowledge-Graph Question Answering (KGQA) benchmarks, our method demonstrates both efficiency and transferability: Using Qwen-2.5-3B, KG-R1 improves answer accuracy with fewer generation tokens than prior multi-module workflow methods that use larger foundation or fine-tuned models. Furthermore, KG-R1 enables plug and play: after training, it maintains strong accuracy on new KGs without modification. These properties make KG-R1 a promising KG-RAG framework for real-world deployment. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Jinyeop3110/KG-R1.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures. Submitted to ICLR 2026</p></details> |

However, conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods encode content in isolated chunks during ingestion, losing structural and cross-page dependencies, and retrieve a fixed number of pages at inference, regardless of the specific demands of the question or context. This often results in incomplete evidence retrieval and degraded answer quality for multi-page reasoning tasks. To address these limitations, we propose LAD-RAG, a novel Layout-Aware Dynamic RAG framework. During ingestion, LAD-RAG constructs a symbolic document graph that captures layout structure and cross-page dependencies, adding it alongside standard neural embeddings to yield a more holistic representation of the document. During inference, an LLM agent dynamically interacts with the neural and symbolic indices to adaptively retrieve the necessary evidence based on the query. Experiments on MMLongBench-Doc, LongDocURL, DUDE, and MP-DocVQA demonstrate that LAD-RAG improves retrieval, achieving over 90% perfect recall on average without any top-k tuning, and outperforming baseline retrievers by up to 20% in recall at comparable noise levels, yielding higher QA accuracy with minimal latency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Reliable Retrieval in RAG Systems for Large Legal Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06999v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a promising approach to mitigate hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) for legal applications, but its reliability is critically dependent on the accuracy of the retrieval step. This is particularly challenging in the legal domain, where large databases of structurally similar documents often cause retrieval systems to fail. In this paper, we address this challenge by first identifying and quantifying a critical failure mode we term Document-Level Retrieval Mismatch (DRM), where the retriever selects information from entirely incorrect source documents. To mitigate DRM, we investigate a simple and computationally efficient technique which we refer to as Summary-Augmented Chunking (SAC). This method enhances each text chunk with a document-level synthetic summary, thereby injecting crucial global context that would otherwise be lost during a standard chunking process. Our experiments on a diverse set of legal information retrieval tasks show that SAC greatly reduces DRM and, consequently, also improves text-level retrieval precision and recall. Interestingly, we find that a generic summarization strategy outperforms an approach that incorporates legal expert domain knowledge to target specific legal elements. Our work provides evidence that this practical, scalable, and easily integrable technique enhances the reliability of RAG systems when applied to large-scale legal document datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for the 7th Natural Legal Language Processing Workshop (NLLP 2025), co-located with EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

However, its application in sensitive domains is limited by privacy risks. Existing private RAG methods typically rely on query-time differential privacy (DP), which requires repeated noise injection and leads to accumulated privacy loss. To address this issue, we propose DP-SynRAG, a framework that uses LLMs to generate differentially private synthetic RAG databases. Unlike prior methods, the synthetic text can be reused once created, thereby avoiding repeated noise injection and additional privacy costs. To preserve essential information for downstream RAG tasks, DP-SynRAG extends private prediction, which instructs LLMs to generate text that mimics subsampled database records in a DP manner. Experiments show that DP-SynRAG achieves superior performanec to the state-of-the-art private RAG systems while maintaining a fixed privacy budget, offering a scalable solution for privacy-preserving RAG.</p></details> | Under review |

This grounding improves factuality, reduces hallucination, and extends reasoning beyond parametric knowledge. However, this reliance on external knowledge poses a critical yet underexplored safety risk: knowledge poisoning attacks, where adversaries deliberately inject adversarial multimodal content into external knowledge bases to steer model toward generating incorrect or even harmful responses. To expose such vulnerabilities, we propose MM-PoisonRAG, the first framework to systematically design knowledge poisoning in multimodal RAG. We introduce two complementary attack strategies: Localized Poisoning Attack (LPA), which implants targeted multimodal misinformation to manipulate specific queries, and Globalized Poisoning Attack (GPA), which inserts a single adversarial knowledge to broadly disrupt reasoning and induce nonsensical responses across all queries. Comprehensive experiments across tasks, models, and access settings show that LPA achieves targeted manipulation with attack success rates of up to 56%, while GPA completely disrupts model generation to 0% accuracy with just a single adversarial knowledge injection. Our results reveal the fragility of multimodal RAG and highlight the urgent need for defenses against knowledge poisoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/HyeonjeongHa/MM-PoisonRAG</p></details> |

However, a critical gap remains: how to reliably query this structured knowledge without sacrificing its deterministic properties. This paper introduces the SAT-Graph API, a formal query execution layer centered on canonical actions-atomic, composable, and auditable primitives that isolate probabilistic discovery from deterministic retrieval. These actions enable: (i) high-precision hybrid search; (ii) robust reference resolution; (iii) point-in-time version retrieval; and (iv) auditable causal tracing. We demonstrate how planner-guided agents can decompose complex queries into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) of these actions. This two-layer architecture transforms retrieval from an opaque black box to a transparent, auditable process, directly addressing Explainable AI (XAI) requirements for high-stakes domains.</p></details> |  |

It leverages graphs to model the hierarchical structure between specific concepts, enabling more coherent and effective knowledge retrieval for accurate reasoning.Despite its conceptual promise, recent studies report that GraphRAG frequently underperforms vanilla RAG on many real-world tasks. This raises a critical question: Is GraphRAG really effective, and in which scenarios do graph structures provide measurable benefits for RAG systems? To address this, we propose GraphRAG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate GraphRAG models onboth hierarchical knowledge retrieval and deep contextual reasoning. GraphRAG-Bench features a comprehensive dataset with tasks of increasing difficulty, coveringfact retrieval, complex reasoning, contextual summarization, and creative generation, and a systematic evaluation across the entire pipeline, from graph constructionand knowledge retrieval to final generation.

However, existing approaches underutilize the inherent knowledge of large language models (LLMs), leading to suboptimal retrieval decisions and degraded generation performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Self-Routing RAG (SR-RAG), a novel framework that binds selective retrieval with knowledge verbalization. SR-RAG enables an LLM to dynamically decide whether to retrieve external knowledge or verbalize its own parametric knowledge. To this end, we design a multi-task objective that jointly optimizes an LLM for knowledge source selection, knowledge verbalization, and response generation. SR-RAG further incorporates a nearest neighbor search mechanism at inference time to improve the accuracy of knowledge source decisions under domain shifts. Fine-tuning three LLMs with SR-RAG significantly improves both their response accuracy and reduces the inference latency. Compared to the strongest selective retrieval baseline, SR-RAG reduces the number of retrievals by 29% while improving performance by 5.1%.</p></details> |  |

Using the Operations and Maintenance Intelligence (OMIn) dataset, we construct a QA benchmark spanning global sensemaking and actionable maintenance tasks. KEO builds a structured Knowledge Graph (KG) and integrates it into a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, enabling more coherent, dataset-wide reasoning than traditional text-chunk RAG. We evaluate locally deployable LLMs (Gemma-3, Phi-4, Mistral-Nemo) and employ stronger models (GPT-4o, Llama-3.3) as judges. Experiments show that KEO markedly improves global sensemaking by revealing patterns and system-level insights, while text-chunk RAG remains effective for fine-grained procedural tasks requiring localized retrieval. These findings underscore the promise of KG-augmented LLMs for secure, domain-specific QA and their potential in high-stakes reasoning.</p></details> |  |

However, despite their widespread use, popular datasets such as WebQSP and CWQ suffer from critical quality issues, including inaccurate or incomplete ground-truth annotations, poorly constructed questions that are ambiguous, trivial, or unanswerable, and outdated or inconsistent knowledge. Through a manual audit of 16 popular KGQA datasets, including WebQSP and CWQ, we find that the average factual correctness rate is only 57 %. To address these issues, we introduce KGQAGen, an LLM-in-the-loop framework that systematically resolves these pitfalls. KGQAGen combines structured knowledge grounding, LLM-guided generation, and symbolic verification to produce challenging and verifiable QA instances. Using KGQAGen, we construct KGQAGen-10k, a ten-thousand scale benchmark grounded in Wikidata, and evaluate a diverse set of KG-RAG models. Experimental results demonstrate that even state-of-the-art systems struggle on this benchmark, highlighting its ability to expose limitations of existing models.

Investigating Robustness of Guardrails under RAG-style Contexts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05310v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs), ensuring the safety of LLM systems has become a pressing concern. External LLM-based guardrail models have emerged as a popular solution to screen unsafe inputs and outputs, but they are themselves fine-tuned or prompt-engineered LLMs that are vulnerable to data distribution shifts. In this paper, taking Retrieval Augmentation Generation (RAG) as a case study, we investigated how robust LLM-based guardrails are against additional information embedded in the context. Through a systematic evaluation of 3 Llama Guards and 2 GPT-oss models, we confirmed that inserting benign documents into the guardrail context alters the judgments of input and output guardrails in around 11% and 8% of cases, making them unreliable. We separately analyzed the effect of each component in the augmented context: retrieved documents, user query, and LLM-generated response. The two mitigation methods we tested only bring minor improvements. These results expose a context-robustness gap in current guardrails and motivate training and evaluation protocols that are robust to retrieval and query composition.</p></details> |  |

However, the efficacy of RAG systems is fundamentally restricted by the performance of their retrieval module, since irrelevant or semantically misaligned documents directly compromise the accuracy of the final generated response. General-purpose dense retrievers can struggle with the nuanced language of specialised domains, while the high accuracy of in-domain models is often achieved at prohibitive computational costs. In this work, we aim to address this trade-off by developing and evaluating a two-stage retrieval architecture that combines a lightweight ModernBERT bidirectional encoder for efficient initial candidate retrieval with a ColBERTv2 late-interaction model for fine-grained re-ranking. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of our retriever module performance and RAG system performance in the biomedical context, fine-tuning the IR module using 10k question-passage pairs from PubMedQA. Our analysis of the retriever module confirmed the positive impact of the ColBERT re-ranker, which improved Recall@3 by up to 4.2 percentage points compared to its retrieve-only counterpart. When integrated into the biomedical RAG, our IR module leads to a state-of-the-art average accuracy of 0.4448 on the five tasks of the MIRAGE question-answering benchmark, outperforming strong baselines such as MedCPT (0.4436). Our ablation studies reveal that this performance is critically dependent on a joint fine-tuning process that aligns the retriever and re-ranker; otherwise, the re-ranker might degrade the performance.</p></details> |  |

The framework enables users to generate 3D-CG content solely through natural language instructions. 3Dify is built upon Dify, an open-source platform for AI application development, and incorporates several state-of-the-art LLM-related technologies such as the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). For 3D-CG generation support, 3Dify automates the operation of various Digital Content Creation (DCC) tools via MCP. When DCC tools do not support MCP-based interaction, the framework employs the Computer-Using Agent (CUA) method to automate Graphical User Interface (GUI) operations. Moreover, to enhance image generation quality, 3Dify allows users to provide feedback by selecting preferred images from multiple candidates. The LLM then learns variable patterns from these selections and applies them to subsequent generations. Furthermore, 3Dify supports the integration of locally deployed LLMs, enabling users to utilize custom-developed models and to reduce both time and monetary costs associated with external API calls by leveraging their own computational resources.</p></details> |  |

While scaling generators improves accuracy, it also raises cost and limits deployability. We explore an orthogonal axis: enlarging the retriever's corpus to reduce reliance on large LLMs. Experimental results show that corpus scaling consistently strengthens RAG and can often serve as a substitute for increasing model size, though with diminishing returns at larger scales. Small- and mid-sized generators paired with larger corpora often rival much larger models with smaller corpora; mid-sized models tend to gain the most, while tiny and large models benefit less. Our analysis shows that improvements arise primarily from increased coverage of answer-bearing passages, while utilization efficiency remains largely unchanged. These findings establish a principled corpus-generator trade-off: investing in larger corpora offers an effective path to stronger RAG, often comparable to enlarging the LLM itself.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automating construction safety inspections using a multi-modal vision-language RAG framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04145v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional construction safety inspection methods are often inefficient as they require navigating through large volume of information. Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) provide opportunities to automate safety inspections through enhanced visual and linguistic understanding. However, existing applications face limitations including irrelevant or unspecific responses, restricted modal inputs and hallucinations. Utilisation of Large Language Models (LLMs) for this purpose is constrained by availability of training data and frequently lack real-time adaptability. This study introduces SiteShield, a multi-modal LVLM-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for automating construction safety inspection reports by integrating visual and audio inputs. Using real-world data, SiteShield outperformed unimodal LLMs without RAG with an F1 score of 0.82, hamming loss of 0.04, precision of 0.76, and recall of 0.96. The findings indicate that SiteShield offers a novel pathway to enhance information retrieval and efficiency in generating safety reports.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 11 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

In real-world scenarios, beyond pure text, a substantial amount of knowledge is stored in tables, and user questions often require retrieving answers that are distributed across multiple tables. Retrieving knowledge from a table corpora (i.e., various individual tables) for a question remains nascent, at least, for (i) how to understand intra- and inter-table knowledge effectively, (ii) how to filter unnecessary tables and how to retrieve the most relevant tables efficiently, (iii) how to prompt LLMs to infer over the retrieval, (iv) how to evaluate the corresponding performance in a realistic setting. Facing the above challenges, in this paper, we first propose a table-corpora-aware RAG framework, named T-RAG, which consists of the hierarchical memory index, multi-stage retrieval, and graph-aware prompting for effective and efficient table knowledge retrieval and inference. Further, we first develop a multi-table question answering benchmark named MultiTableQA, which spans 3 different task types, 57,193 tables, and 23,758 questions in total, and the sources are all from real-world scenarios. Based on MultiTableQA, we did the holistic comparison over table retrieval methods, RAG methods, and table-to-graph representation learning methods, where T-RAG shows the leading accuracy, recall, and running time performance. Also, under T-RAG, we evaluate the inference ability upgrade of different LLMs. Code and Data are available at https://github.com/jiaruzouu/T-RAG</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Link: https://github.com/jiaruzouu/T-RAG</p></details> |

When applying reasoning in specialized contexts with LLMs on top of a RAG, the pipeline can capture contextually relevant information, but it is not designed to retrieve comparable cases or related problems. While RAG is effective at extracting factual information, its outputs in specialized reasoning tasks often remain generic, reflecting broad facts rather than context-specific insights. In finance, it results in generic risks that are true for the majority of companies. To address this limitation, we propose a peer-aware comparative inference layer on top of RAG. Our contrastive approach outperforms baseline RAG in text generation metrics such as ROUGE and BERTScore in comparison with human-generated equity research and risk.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 1 figure, Workshop on Generative AI in Finance, NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

It adversely affects performance on downstream tasks such as question answering (QA). Existing approaches often attempt to mitigate conflicts by directly comparing two knowledge sources in a side-by-side manner, but this can overwhelm LLMs with extraneous or lengthy contexts, ultimately hindering their ability to identify and mitigate inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose Micro-Act a framework with a hierarchical action space that automatically perceives context complexity and adaptively decomposes each knowledge source into a sequence of fine-grained comparisons. These comparisons are represented as actionable steps, enabling reasoning beyond the superficial context. Through extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, Micro-Act consistently achieves significant increase in QA accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines across all 5 datasets and 3 conflict types, especially in temporal and semantic types where all baselines fail significantly. More importantly, Micro-Act exhibits robust performance on non-conflict questions simultaneously, highlighting its practical value in real-world RAG applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2025 Main</p></details> |

In this work, we investigate a critical question: does the benefit of these complex robust training methods diminish as language models become more powerful? Through systematic evaluation across multiple model scales and question-answering datasets, our analysis reveals a consistent trend: \emph{the marginal robustness benefit of sophisticated training strategies decreases substantially as model capacity increases.} While smaller models show significant performance improvements from complex document selection and adversarial objectives, more capable models achieve comparable or even superior performance with simpler training approaches. Further investigation demonstrates that stronger models naturally exhibit better confidence calibration, cross-dataset generalization capability, and more effective attention patterns, even under simple training regimes. These findings suggest that as foundation models evolve, the engineering effort invested in complex robust training may yield diminishing returns, indicating that simplified RAG pipelines could suffice for powerful models while maintaining competitive performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGIR-AP 2025</p></details> |

We present PunGPT2, the first fully open-source Punjabi generative model suite, trained on a 35GB corpus covering literature, religious texts, news, social discourse, etc. PunGPT2 captures Punjabi's syntactic and morphological richness through a tokenizer optimized for Gurmukhi and Shahmukhi scripts. We introduce Pun-RAG, a retrieval-augmented framework integrating PunGPT2 with a FAISS retriever over a curated Punjabi knowledge base, and Pun-Instruct, an instruction-tuned variant using QLoRA for robust zero-shot summarization, translation, and question answering. Our key innovation, Quantum-RAG, fuses sparse, dense, and quantum kernel embeddings for efficient, context-aware retrieval with low memory overhead, marking the first practical quantum-inspired retrieval in a low-resource LLM. Our models outperform multilingual baselines (mBERT, mT5, MuRIL, BLOOM) on FLORES-200, IndicGenBench, and a new PunjabiEval suite. Quantum-RAG yields +7.4 Recall@10 over FAISS and +3.5 BLEU over mT5 on PunjabiEval. We publicly release all training scripts, hyperparameters, evaluation pipelines, the 35GB Punjabi corpus, the PunjabiEval benchmark, and all model weights, establishing new state-of-the-art results for Punjabi language generation and retrieval.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge-Graph Based RAG System Evaluation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02549v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) has become a significant research focus and is utilized in various fields, such as text generation and dialog systems. One of the most essential applications of LLM is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), which greatly enhances generated content's reliability and relevance. However, evaluating RAG systems remains a challenging task. Traditional evaluation metrics struggle to effectively capture the key features of modern LLM-generated content that often exhibits high fluency and naturalness. Inspired by the RAGAS tool, a well-known RAG evaluation framework, we extended this framework into a KG-based evaluation paradigm, enabling multi-hop reasoning and semantic community clustering to derive more comprehensive scoring metrics. By incorporating these comprehensive evaluation criteria, we gain a deeper understanding of RAG systems and a more nuanced perspective on their performance. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we compare its performance with RAGAS scores and construct a human-annotated subset to assess the correlation between human judgments and automated metrics. In addition, we conduct targeted experiments to demonstrate that our KG-based evaluation method is more sensitive to subtle semantic differences in generated outputs. Finally, we discuss the key challenges in evaluating RAG systems and highlight potential directions for future research.</p></details> |  |

The existing methods can be categorized into Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM)-based and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based methods. However, the former were susceptible to hallucinations, while the latter struggled for inter-modal disconnection and cross-page fragmentation. To address these challenges, a novel multi-modal RAG model, named MHier-RAG, was proposed, leveraging both textual and visual information across long-range pages to facilitate accurate question answering for visual-rich documents. A hierarchical indexing method with the integration of flattened in-page chunks and topological cross-page chunks was designed to jointly establish in-page multi-modal associations and long-distance cross-page dependencies. By means of joint similarity evaluation and large language model (LLM)-based re-ranking, a multi-granularity semantic retrieval method, including the page-level parent page retrieval and document-level summary retrieval, was proposed to foster multi-modal evidence connection and long-distance evidence integration and reasoning. Experimental results performed on public datasets, MMLongBench-Doc and LongDocURL, demonstrated the superiority of our MHier-RAG method in understanding and answering modality-rich and multi-page documents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comments: Update Title, Author, Abstract, etc</p></details> |

However, these systems remain prone to hallucinations due to limited factual grounding. While text-based dialogue systems address this challenge by integrating tools such as web search and knowledge graph APIs, we introduce the first approach to extend tool use directly into speech-in speech-out systems. A key challenge is that tool integration substantially increases response latency, disrupting conversational flow. To mitigate this, we propose Streaming Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Streaming RAG), a novel framework that reduces user-perceived latency by predicting tool queries in parallel with user speech, even before the user finishes speaking. Specifically, we develop a post-training pipeline that teaches the model when to issue tool calls during ongoing speech and how to generate spoken summaries that fuse audio queries with retrieved text results, thereby improving both accuracy and responsiveness. To evaluate our approach, we construct AudioCRAG, a benchmark created by converting queries from the publicly available CRAG dataset into speech form. Experimental results demonstrate that our streaming RAG approach increases QA accuracy by up to 200% relative (from 11.1% to 34.2% absolute) and further enhances user experience by reducing tool use latency by 20%. Importantly, our streaming RAG approach is modality-agnostic and can be applied equally to typed input, paving the way for more agentic, real-time AI assistants.</p></details> |  |

Current biomedical question-answering systems primarily focus on short-form answers, failing to provide the comprehensive explanations necessary for clinical decision-making. We present RAG-BioQA, a novel framework combining retrieval-augmented generation with domain-specific fine-tuning to produce evidence-based, long-form biomedical answers. Our approach integrates BioBERT embeddings with FAISS indexing and compares various re-ranking strategies (BM25, ColBERT, MonoT5) to optimize context selection before synthesizing evidence through a fine-tuned T5 model. Experimental results on the PubMedQA dataset show significant improvements over baselines, with our best model achieving substantial gains across BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR metrics, advancing the state of accessible, evidence-based biomedical knowledge retrieval.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-tuning with RAG for Improving LLM Learning of New Skills](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01375v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents deployed for multi-step tasks frequently fail in predictable ways: attempting actions with unmet preconditions, issuing redundant commands, or mishandling environment constraints. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can improve performance by providing runtime guidance, it requires maintaining external knowledge databases and adds computational overhead at every deployment. We propose a simple pipeline that converts inference-time retrieval into learned competence through distillation. Our approach: (1) extracts compact, reusable hints from agent failures, (2) uses these hints to generate improved teacher trajectories via one-shot retrieval at episode start, and (3) trains student models on these trajectories with hint strings removed, forcing internalization rather than memorization. Across two interactive benchmarks, ALFWorld (household tasks) and WebShop (online shopping), distilled students consistently outperform baseline agents, achieving up to 91% success on ALFWorld (vs. 79% for baselines) and improving WebShop scores to 72 (vs. 61 for baselines), while using 10-60% fewer tokens than retrieval-augmented teachers depending on the environment. The approach generalizes across model scales (7B/14B parameters) and agent architectures (ReAct/StateAct), demonstrating that retrieval benefits can be effectively internalized through targeted fine-tuning without permanent runtime dependencies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[Metaphor identification using large language models: A comparison of RAG, prompt engineering, and fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24866v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metaphor is a pervasive feature of discourse and a powerful lens for examining cognition, emotion, and ideology. Large-scale analysis, however, has been constrained by the need for manual annotation due to the context-sensitive nature of metaphor. This study investigates the potential of large language models (LLMs) to automate metaphor identification in full texts. We compare three methods: (i) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where the model is provided with a codebook and instructed to annotate texts based on its rules and examples; (ii) prompt engineering, where we design task-specific verbal instructions; and (iii) fine-tuning, where the model is trained on hand-coded texts to optimize performance. Within prompt engineering, we test zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought strategies. Our results show that state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs can achieve high accuracy, with fine-tuning yielding a median F1 score of 0.79. A comparison of human and LLM outputs reveals that most discrepancies are systematic, reflecting well-known grey areas and conceptual challenges in metaphor theory. We propose that LLMs can be used to at least partly automate metaphor identification and can serve as a testbed for developing and refining metaphor identification protocols and the theory that underpins them.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Eyes-on-Me, a modular attack that decomposes an adversarial document into reusable Attention Attractors and Focus Regions. Attractors are optimized to direct attention to the Focus Region. Attackers can then insert semantic baits for the retriever or malicious instructions for the generator, adapting to new targets at near zero cost. This is achieved by steering a small subset of attention heads that we empirically identify as strongly correlated with attack success. Across 18 end-to-end RAG settings (3 datasets $\times$ 2 retrievers $\times$ 3 generators), Eyes-on-Me raises average attack success rates from 21.9 to 57.8 (+35.9 points, 2.6$\times$ over prior work). A single optimized attractor transfers to unseen black box retrievers and generators without retraining. Our findings establish a scalable paradigm for RAG data poisoning and show that modular, reusable components pose a practical threat to modern AI systems. They also reveal a strong link between attention concentration and model outputs, informing interpretability research.</p></details> |  |

Building on Gienapp's utility-dimension framework, we designed a human-centred questionnaire that assesses RAG outputs across 12 dimensions. We iteratively refined the questionnaire through several rounds of ratings on a set of query-output pairs and semantic discussions. Ultimately, we incorporated feedback from both a human rater and a human-LLM pair. Results indicate that while large language models (LLMs) reliably focus on metric descriptions and scale labels, they exhibit weaknesses in detecting textual format variations. Humans struggled to focus strictly on metric descriptions and labels. LLM ratings and explanations were viewed as a helpful support, but numeric LLM and human ratings lacked agreement. The final questionnaire extends the initial framework by focusing on user intent, text structuring, and information verifiability.</p></details> |  |

However, existing extraction methods typically rely on malicious inputs such as prompt injection or jailbreaking, making them easily detectable via input- or output-level detection. In this paper, we introduce Implicit Knowledge Extraction Attack (IKEA), which conducts Knowledge Extraction on RAG systems through benign queries. Specifically, IKEA first leverages anchor concepts-keywords related to internal knowledge-to generate queries with a natural appearance, and then designs two mechanisms that lead anchor concepts to thoroughly "explore" the RAG's knowledge: (1) Experience Reflection Sampling, which samples anchor concepts based on past query-response histories, ensuring their relevance to the topic; (2) Trust Region Directed Mutation, which iteratively mutates anchor concepts under similarity constraints to further exploit the embedding space. Extensive experiments demonstrate IKEA's effectiveness under various defenses, surpassing baselines by over 80% in extraction efficiency and 90% in attack success rate. Moreover, the substitute RAG system built from IKEA's extractions shows comparable performance to the original RAG and outperforms those based on baselines across multiple evaluation tasks, underscoring the stealthy copyright infringement risk in RAG systems.</p></details> |  |

We propose Knowledgeable-R1, a reinforcement-learning framework that explicitly trains large language models to use parametric knowledge (PK) to resist contextual interference while still exploiting external context when it is reliably helpful. Knowledgeable-R1 introduces a joint sampling scheme that generates paired responses with and without retrieval, and learns both local advantages (within each decoding regime) and global advantages under the same input to quantify when to ignore misleading context versus adopt it. We employ an asymmetric advantage transformation that amplifies exploratory behaviors toward parametric knowledge. Experiments show that \method significantly improves robustness and reasoning accuracy in knowledge conflict scenarios and general RAG scenarios, outperforming SOTA baselines by 23% in counterfactual scenarios, and without degradation when the retrieved context is fully accurate.Our code are available at https://github.com/lcy80366872/knowledgeable-R1.</p></details> |  |

They can help generate long-form answers for scientific questions, which are crucial for comprehensive understanding of complex phenomena that require detailed explanations spanning multiple interconnected concepts and evidence. However, LLMs often suffer from hallucination, especially in the challenging task of long-form scientific question answering. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches can ground LLMs by incorporating external knowledge sources to improve trustworthiness. In this context, scientific simulators, which play a vital role in validating hypotheses, offer a particularly promising retrieval source to mitigate hallucination and enhance answer factuality. However, existing RAG approaches cannot be directly applied for scientific simulation-based retrieval due to two fundamental challenges: how to retrieve from scientific simulators, and how to efficiently verify and update long-form answers. To overcome these challenges, we propose the simulator-based RAG framework (SimulRAG) and provide a long-form scientific QA benchmark covering climate science and epidemiology with ground truth verified by both simulations and human annotators. In this framework, we propose a generalized simulator retrieval interface to transform between textual and numerical modalities. We further design a claim-level generation method that utilizes uncertainty estimation scores and simulator boundary assessment (UE+SBA) to efficiently verify and update claims. Extensive experiments demonstrate SimulRAG outperforms traditional RAG baselines by 30.4% in informativeness and 16.3% in factuality. UE+SBA further improves efficiency and quality for claim-level generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Haozh...</summary><p>Haozhou Xu and Dongxia Wu are co-first authors</p></details> |

The proposed approach overcomes limitations of existing methods by enabling fine-grained control over item difficulty, psychometric calibration, and cognitive alignment. It employs multi-graph isolation to preserve domain-specific semantics and leverages a distributed agent architecture coordinated through Data Distribution Service, abbreviated as DDS, for scalable and fault-tolerant operations. Each agent specializes in tasks such as retrieval, generation, or evaluation, forming a modular and traceable pipeline. Distinctively, the framework encodes semantic hierarchies, PageRank-based concept weighting, and assessment-theory parameters directly into the generation process, ensuring that questions are both contextually grounded and cognitively calibrated. Deployed at Taiwan's National Institute of Environmental Research, the system has demonstrated practical value by reducing manual workload, improving reliability and validity, and supporting both adaptive and standardized assessments. By integrating psychometric theory with AI-driven retrieval and generation, this work establishes a scalable and cognitively aligned solution for education and professional certification.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures and 6 tables</p></details> |

However, the performance of MLLMs for knowledge-intensive visual questions, which require external knowledge beyond the visual content of an image, still remains limited. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a promising solution to provide models with external knowledge, its conventional single-pass framework often fails to gather sufficient knowledge. To overcome this limitation, we propose MI-RAG, a Multimodal Iterative RAG framework that leverages reasoning to enhance retrieval and incorporates knowledge synthesis to refine its understanding. At each iteration, the model formulates a reasoning-guided multi-query to explore multiple facets of knowledge. Subsequently, these queries drive a joint search across heterogeneous knowledge bases, retrieving diverse knowledge. This retrieved knowledge is then synthesized to enrich the reasoning record, progressively deepening the model's understanding. Experiments on challenging benchmarks, including Encyclopedic VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA, show that MI-RAG significantly improves both retrieval recall and answer accuracy, establishing a scalable approach for compositional reasoning in knowledge-intensive VQA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Head RAG: Solving Multi-Aspect Problems with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05085v5)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling the retrieval of documents into the LLM context to provide more accurate and relevant responses. Existing RAG solutions do not focus on queries that may require fetching multiple documents with substantially different contents. Such queries occur frequently, but are challenging because the embeddings of these documents may be distant in the embedding space, making it hard to retrieve them all. This paper introduces Multi-Head RAG (MRAG), a novel scheme designed to address this gap with a simple yet powerful idea: leveraging activations of Transformer's multi-head attention layer, instead of the decoder layer, as keys for fetching multi-aspect documents. The driving observation is that different attention heads learn to capture different data aspects. Harnessing the corresponding activations results in embeddings that represent various facets of data items and queries, improving the retrieval accuracy for complex queries. We provide an evaluation methodology and metrics, multi-aspect datasets, and real-world use cases to demonstrate MRAG's effectiveness. We show MRAG's design advantages over 18 RAG baselines, empirical improvements of up to 20% in retrieval success ratios, and benefits for downstream LLM generation. MRAG can be seamlessly integrated with existing RAG frameworks and benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

The evaluator reports decision accuracy, trace quality (completeness, correctness, order), retrieval effectiveness, SQL correctness via result-set equivalence, policy coverage, latency, and an explanation-hallucination rate.

| **[Game-Oriented ASR Error Correction via RAG-Enhanced LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23630v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of multiplayer online games, real-time voice communication is essential for team coordination. However, general ASR systems struggle with gaming-specific challenges like short phrases, rapid speech, jargon, and noise, leading to frequent errors. To address this, we propose the GO-AEC framework, which integrates large language models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and a data augmentation strategy using LLMs and TTS. GO-AEC includes data augmentation, N-best hypothesis-based correction, and a dynamic game knowledge base. Experiments show GO-AEC reduces character error rate by 6.22% and sentence error rate by 29.71%, significantly improving ASR accuracy in gaming scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReliabilityRAG: Effective and Provably Robust Defense for RAG-based Web-Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23519v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models by grounding their outputs in external documents. These systems, however, remain vulnerable to attacks on the retrieval corpus, such as prompt injection. RAG-based search systems (e.g., Google's Search AI Overview) present an interesting setting for studying and protecting against such threats, as defense algorithms can benefit from built-in reliability signals -- like document ranking -- and represent a non-LLM challenge for the adversary due to decades of work to thwart SEO. Motivated by, but not limited to, this scenario, this work introduces ReliabilityRAG, a framework for adversarial robustness that explicitly leverages reliability information of retrieved documents. Our first contribution adopts a graph-theoretic perspective to identify a "consistent majority" among retrieved documents to filter out malicious ones. We introduce a novel algorithm based on finding a Maximum Independent Set (MIS) on a document graph where edges encode contradiction. Our MIS variant explicitly prioritizes higher-reliability documents and provides provable robustness guarantees against bounded adversarial corruption under natural assumptions. Recognizing the computational cost of exact MIS for large retrieval sets, our second contribution is a scalable weighted sample and aggregate framework. It explicitly utilizes reliability information, preserving some robustness guarantees while efficiently handling many documents. We present empirical results showing ReliabilityRAG provides superior robustness against adversarial attacks compared to prior methods, maintains high benign accuracy, and excels in long-form generation tasks where prior robustness-focused methods struggled. Our work is a significant step towards more effective, provably robust defenses against retrieved corpus corruption in RAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Cross-modal RAG: Sub-dimensional Text-to-Image Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21956v3)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image generation increasingly demands access to domain-specific, fine-grained, and rapidly evolving knowledge that pretrained models cannot fully capture, necessitating the integration of retrieval methods. Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods attempt to address this by retrieving globally relevant images, but they fail when no single image contains all desired elements from a complex user query. We propose Cross-modal RAG, a novel framework that decomposes both queries and images into sub-dimensional components, enabling subquery-aware retrieval and generation. Our method introduces a hybrid retrieval strategy - combining a sub-dimensional sparse retriever with a dense retriever - to identify a Pareto-optimal set of images, each contributing complementary aspects of the query. During generation, a multimodal large language model is guided to selectively condition on relevant visual features aligned to specific subqueries, ensuring subquery-aware image synthesis. Extensive experiments on MS-COCO, Flickr30K, WikiArt, CUB, and ImageNet-LT demonstrate that Cross-modal RAG significantly outperforms existing baselines in the retrieval and further contributes to generation quality, while maintaining high efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Your RAG is Unfair: Exposing Fairness Vulnerabilities in Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Backdoor Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22486v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances factual grounding by integrating retrieval mechanisms with generative models but introduces new attack surfaces, particularly through backdoor attacks. While prior research has largely focused on disinformation threats, fairness vulnerabilities remain underexplored. Unlike conventional backdoors that rely on direct trigger-to-target mappings, fairness-driven attacks exploit the interaction between retrieval and generation models, manipulating semantic relationships between target groups and social biases to establish a persistent and covert influence on content generation. This paper introduces BiasRAG, a systematic framework that exposes fairness vulnerabilities in RAG through a two-phase backdoor attack. During the pre-training phase, the query encoder is compromised to align the target group with the intended social bias, ensuring long-term persistence. In the post-deployment phase, adversarial documents are injected into knowledge bases to reinforce the backdoor, subtly influencing retrieved content while remaining undetectable under standard fairness evaluations. Together, BiasRAG ensures precise target alignment over sensitive attributes, stealthy execution, and resilience. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that BiasRAG achieves high attack success rates while preserving contextual relevance and utility, establishing a persistent and evolving threat to fairness in RAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Zero-Effort Image-to-Music Generation: An Interpretable RAG-based VLM Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22378v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Image-to-Music (I2M) generation has garnered significant attention, with potential applications in fields such as gaming, advertising, and multi-modal art creation. However, due to the ambiguous and subjective nature of I2M tasks, most end-to-end methods lack interpretability, leaving users puzzled about the generation results. Even methods based on emotion mapping face controversy, as emotion represents only a singular aspect of art. Additionally, most learning-based methods require substantial computational resources and large datasets for training, hindering accessibility for common users. To address these challenges, we propose the first Vision Language Model (VLM)-based I2M framework that offers high interpretability and low computational cost. Specifically, we utilize ABC notation to bridge the text and music modalities, enabling the VLM to generate music using natural language. We then apply multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and self-refinement techniques to allow the VLM to produce high-quality music without external training. Furthermore, we leverage the generated motivations in text and the attention maps from the VLM to provide explanations for the generated results in both text and image modalities. To validate our method, we conduct both human studies and machine evaluations, where our method outperforms others in terms of music quality and music-image consistency, indicating promising results.

| **[Comparing RAG and GraphRAG for Page-Level Retrieval Question Answering on Math Textbook](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16780v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Technology-enhanced learning environments often help students retrieve relevant learning content for questions arising during self-paced study. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as novel aids for information retrieval during learning. While LLMs are effective for general-purpose question-answering, they typically lack alignment with the domain knowledge of specific course materials such as textbooks and slides. We investigate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG, a knowledge graph-enhanced RAG approach, for page-level question answering in an undergraduate mathematics textbook. While RAG has been effective for retrieving discrete, contextually relevant passages, GraphRAG may excel in modeling interconnected concepts and hierarchical knowledge structures. We curate a dataset of 477 question-answer pairs, each tied to a distinct textbook page. We then compare the standard embedding-based RAG methods to GraphRAG for evaluating both retrieval accuracy-whether the correct page is retrieved-and generated answer quality via F1 scores. Our findings show that embedding-based RAG achieves higher retrieval accuracy and better F1 scores compared to GraphRAG, which tends to retrieve excessive and sometimes irrelevant content due to its entity-based structure. We also explored re-ranking the retrieved pages with LLM and observed mixed results, including performance drop and hallucinations when dealing with larger context windows. Overall, this study highlights both the promises and challenges of page-level retrieval systems in educational contexts, emphasizing the need for more refined retrieval methods to build reliable AI tutoring solutions in providing reference page numbers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond RAG vs. Long-Context: Learning Distraction-Aware Retrieval for Efficient Knowledge Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21865v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a framework for grounding Large Language Models (LLMs) in external, up-to-date information. However, recent advancements in context window size allow LLMs to process inputs of up to 128K tokens or more, offering an alternative strategy: supplying the full document context directly to the model, rather than relying on RAG to retrieve a subset of contexts. Nevertheless, this emerging alternative strategy has notable limitations: (i) it is token-inefficient to handle large and potentially redundant contexts; (ii) it exacerbates the `lost in the middle' phenomenon; and (iii) under limited model capacity, it amplifies distraction, ultimately degrading LLM output quality. In this paper, we propose LDAR (Learning Distraction-Aware Retrieval), an adaptive retriever that learns to retrieve contexts in a way that mitigates interference from distracting passages, thereby achieving significantly higher performance with reduced token usage compared to long-context approaches. Extensive experiments across diverse LLM architectures and six knowledge-intensive benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, highlighting the importance of balancing the trade-off between information coverage and distraction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online-Optimized RAG for Tool Use and Function Calling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20415v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many applications, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) drives tool use and function calling by embedding the (user) queries and matching them to pre-specified tool/function descriptions. In this paper, we address an embedding misalignment issue that often arises in practical applications due to imperfect embedding models or noisy descriptions; such misalignment may lead to incorrect retrieval and task failure. We introduce Online-Optimized RAG, a deployment-time framework that continually adapts retrieval embeddings from live interactions using minimal feedback (e.g., task success). Online-Optimized RAG applies lightweight online gradient updates with negligible per-query latency and requires no changes to the underlying LLM. The method is plug-and-play: it supports both single- and multi-hop tool use, dynamic tool inventories, and $K$-retrieval with re-ranking. We provide a problem-dependent theoretical analysis that quantifies how the method's performance depends on the initialization quality of the embeddings and other related quantities. Across diverse tool-use and document-retrieval scenarios, our Online-Optimized RAG consistently improves tool selection accuracy and end-task success, thus providing a simple, practical path to robust, self-improving RAG systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Provenance Analysis of Archaeological Artifacts via Multimodal RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20769v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we present a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based system for provenance analysis of archaeological artifacts, designed to support expert reasoning by integrating multimodal retrieval and large vision-language models (VLMs). The system constructs a dual-modal knowledge base from reference texts and images, enabling raw visual, edge-enhanced, and semantic retrieval to identify stylistically similar objects. Retrieved candidates are synthesized by the VLM to generate structured inferences, including chronological, geographical, and cultural attributions, alongside interpretive justifications. We evaluate the system on a set of Eastern Eurasian Bronze Age artifacts from the British Museum. Expert evaluation demonstrates that the system produces meaningful and interpretable outputs, offering scholars concrete starting points for analysis and significantly alleviating the cognitive burden of navigating vast comparative corpora.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal-Counterfactual RAG: The Integration of Causal-Counterfactual Reasoning into RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14435v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing (NLP), enabling diverse applications by integrating large-scale pre-trained knowledge. However, their static knowledge limits dynamic reasoning over external information, especially in knowledge-intensive domains. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this challenge by combining retrieval mechanisms with generative modeling to improve contextual understanding. Traditional RAG systems suffer from disrupted contextual integrity due to text chunking and over-reliance on semantic similarity for retrieval, often resulting in shallow and less accurate responses. We propose Causal-Counterfactual RAG, a novel framework that integrates explicit causal graphs representing cause-effect relationships into the retrieval process and incorporates counterfactual reasoning grounded on the causal structure. Unlike conventional methods, our framework evaluates not only direct causal evidence but also the counterfactuality of associated causes, combining results from both to generate more robust, accurate, and interpretable answers. By leveraging causal pathways and associated hypothetical scenarios, Causal-Counterfactual RAG preserves contextual coherence, reduces hallucination, and enhances reasoning fidelity.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAG Security and Privacy: Formalizing the Threat Model and Attack Surface](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20324v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an emerging approach in natural language processing that combines large language models (LLMs) with external document retrieval to produce more accurate and grounded responses. While RAG has shown strong potential in reducing hallucinations and improving factual consistency, it also introduces new privacy and security challenges that differ from those faced by traditional LLMs. Existing research has demonstrated that LLMs can leak sensitive information through training data memorization or adversarial prompts, and RAG systems inherit many of these vulnerabilities. At the same time, reliance of RAG on an external knowledge base opens new attack surfaces, including the potential for leaking information about the presence or content of retrieved documents, or for injecting malicious content to manipulate model behavior. Despite these risks, there is currently no formal framework that defines the threat landscape for RAG systems. In this paper, we address a critical gap in the literature by proposing, to the best of our knowledge, the first formal threat model for retrieval-RAG systems. We introduce a structured taxonomy of adversary types based on their access to model components and data, and we formally define key threat vectors such as document-level membership inference and data poisoning, which pose serious privacy and integrity risks in real-world deployments. By establishing formal definitions and attack models, our work lays the foundation for a more rigorous and principled understanding of privacy and security in RAG systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 5th ICDM Workshop on September 20, 2025</p></details> |
