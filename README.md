However, existing methods face several challenges. Learning-based approaches depend on small-scale indoor datasets, limiting the scene diversity and layout complexity. While large language models (LLMs) can leverage diverse text-domain knowledge, they struggle with spatial realism, often producing unnatural object placements that fail to respect common sense. Our key insight is that vision perception can bridge this gap by providing realistic spatial guidance that LLMs lack. To this end, we introduce Scenethesis, a training-free agentic framework that integrates LLM-based scene planning with vision-guided layout refinement. Given a text prompt, Scenethesis first employs an LLM to draft a coarse layout. A vision module then refines it by generating an image guidance and extracting scene structure to capture inter-object relations. Next, an optimization module iteratively enforces accurate pose alignment and physical plausibility, preventing artifacts like object penetration and instability. Finally, a judge module verifies spatial coherence. Comprehensive experiments show that Scenethesis generates diverse, realistic, and physically plausible 3D interactive scenes, making it valuable for virtual content creation, simulation environments, and embodied AI research.</p></details> |  |

While recent advancements have primarily focused on improving the model structure and training data of MRMs, there has been limited exploration into the effectiveness of long-term reasoning capabilities for reward modeling and how to activate these capabilities in MRMs. In this paper, we explore how Reinforcement Learning (RL) can be used to improve reward modeling. Specifically, we reformulate the reward modeling problem as a rule-based RL task. However, we observe that directly applying existing RL algorithms, such as Reinforce++, to reward modeling often leads to training instability or even collapse due to the inherent limitations of these algorithms. To address this issue, we propose the StableReinforce algorithm, which refines the training loss, advantage estimation strategy, and reward design of existing RL methods. These refinements result in more stable training dynamics and superior performance. To facilitate MRM training, we collect 200K preference data from diverse datasets. Our reward model, R1-Reward, trained using the StableReinforce algorithm on this dataset, significantly improves performance on multimodal reward modeling benchmarks. Compared to previous SOTA models, R1-Reward achieves a $8.4\%$ improvement on the VL Reward-Bench and a $14.3\%$ improvement on the Multimodal Reward Bench. Moreover, with more inference compute, R1-Reward's performance is further enhanced, highlighting the potential of RL algorithms in optimizing MRMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Home ...</summary><p>Home page: https://github.com/yfzhang114/r1_reward</p></details> |
| **[ReplaceMe: Network Simplification via Layer Pruning and Linear Transformations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02819v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce ReplaceMe, a generalized training-free depth pruning method that effectively replaces transformer blocks with a linear operation, while maintaining high performance for low compression ratios. In contrast to conventional pruning approaches that require additional training or fine-tuning, our approach requires only a small calibration dataset that is used to estimate a linear transformation to approximate the pruned blocks. This estimated linear mapping can be seamlessly merged with the remaining transformer blocks, eliminating the need for any additional network parameters. Our experiments show that ReplaceMe consistently outperforms other training-free approaches and remains highly competitive with state-of-the-art pruning methods that involve extensive retraining/fine-tuning and architectural modifications. Applied to several large language models (LLMs), ReplaceMe achieves up to 25% pruning while retaining approximately 90% of the original model's performance on open benchmarks - without any training or healing steps, resulting in minimal computational overhead (see Fig.1). We provide an open-source library implementing ReplaceMe alongside several state-of-the-art depth pruning techniques, available at this repository.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Quantifying the Hessian Structure of Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02809v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Empirical studies reported that the Hessian matrix of neural networks (NNs) exhibits a near-block-diagonal structure, yet its theoretical foundation remains unclear. In this work, we reveal two forces that shape the Hessian structure: a ``static force'' rooted in the architecture design, and a ``dynamic force'' arisen from training. We then provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of ``static force'' at random initialization. We study linear models and 1-hidden-layer networks with the mean-square (MSE) loss and the Cross-Entropy (CE) loss for classification tasks. By leveraging random matrix theory, we compare the limit distributions of the diagonal and off-diagonal Hessian blocks and find that the block-diagonal structure arises as $C \rightarrow \infty$, where $C$ denotes the number of classes. Our findings reveal that $C$ is a primary driver of the near-block-diagonal structure. These results may shed new light on the Hessian structure of large language models (LLMs), which typically operate with a large $C$ exceeding $10^4$ or $10^5$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating HomeAssistant Automations Using an LLM-based Chatbot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02802v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To combat climate change, individuals are encouraged to adopt sustainable habits, in particular, with their household, optimizing their electrical consumption. Conversational agents, such as Smart Home Assistants, hold promise as effective tools for promoting sustainable practices within households. Our research investigated the application of Large Language Models (LLM) in enhancing smart home automation and promoting sustainable household practices, specifically using the HomeAssistant framework. In particular, it highlights the potential of GPT models in generating accurate automation routines. While the LLMs showed proficiency in understanding complex commands and creating valid JSON outputs, challenges such as syntax errors and message malformations were noted, indicating areas for further improvement. Still, despite minimal quantitative differences between "green" and "no green" prompts, qualitative feedback highlighted a positive shift towards sustainability in the routines generated with environmentally focused prompts. Then, an empirical evaluation (N=56) demonstrated that the system was well-received and found engaging by users compared to its traditional rule-based counterpart. Our findings highlight the role of LLMs in advancing smart home technologies and suggest further research to refine these models for broader, real-world applications to support sustainable living.</p></details> |  |
| **[HSplitLoRA: A Heterogeneous Split Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning Framework for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02795v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs, revolutionizing the natural language processing domain and beyond. Due to immense parameter sizes, fine-tuning these models with private data for diverse downstream tasks has become mainstream. Though federated learning (FL) offers a promising solution for fine-tuning LLMs without sharing raw data, substantial computing costs hinder its democratization. Moreover, in real-world scenarios, private client devices often possess heterogeneous computing resources, further complicating LLM fine-tuning. To combat these challenges, we propose HSplitLoRA, a heterogeneous parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) framework built on split learning (SL) and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning, for efficiently fine-tuning LLMs on heterogeneous client devices. HSplitLoRA first identifies important weights based on their contributions to LLM training. It then dynamically configures the decomposition ranks of LoRA adapters for selected weights and determines the model split point according to varying computing budgets of client devices. Finally, a noise-free adapter aggregation mechanism is devised to support heterogeneous adapter aggregation without introducing noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HSplitLoRA outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in training accuracy and convergence speed.</p></details> | 16 pages, 22 figures |
| **[Activation Space Interventions Can Be Transferred Between Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04429v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The study of representation universality in AI models reveals growing convergence across domains, modalities, and architectures. However, the practical applications of representation universality remain largely unexplored. We bridge this gap by demonstrating that safety interventions can be transferred between models through learned mappings of their shared activation spaces. We demonstrate this approach on two well-established AI safety tasks: backdoor removal and refusal of harmful prompts, showing successful transfer of steering vectors that alter the models' outputs in a predictable way. Additionally, we propose a new task, \textit{corrupted capabilities}, where models are fine-tuned to embed knowledge tied to a backdoor. This tests their ability to separate useful skills from backdoors, reflecting real-world challenges. Extensive experiments across Llama, Qwen and Gemma model families show that our method enables using smaller models to efficiently align larger ones. Furthermore, we demonstrate that autoencoder mappings between base and fine-tuned models can serve as reliable ``lightweight safety switches", allowing dynamic toggling between model behaviors.</p></details> | 68 pages |

However, current inversion-based approaches struggle with big modifications (e.g., adding or removing objects) due to the structured nature of inversion noise, which hinders substantial changes. Meanwhile, instruction-based methods often constrain users to black-box operations, limiting direct interaction for specifying editing regions and intensity. To address these limitations, we propose BrushEdit, a novel inpainting-based instruction-guided image editing paradigm, which leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and image inpainting models to enable autonomous, user-friendly, and interactive free-form instruction editing. Specifically, we devise a system enabling free-form instruction editing by integrating MLLMs and a dual-branch image inpainting model in an agent-cooperative framework to perform editing category classification, main object identification, mask acquisition, and editing area inpainting. Extensive experiments show that our framework effectively combines MLLMs and inpainting models, achieving superior performance across seven metrics including mask region preservation and editing effect coherence.</p></details> | <details><summary>WebPa...</summary><p>WebPage available at https://liyaowei-stu.github.io/project/BrushEdit/</p></details> |
| **[Giving Simulated Cells a Voice: Evolving Prompt-to-Intervention Models for Cellular Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02766v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Guiding biological systems toward desired states, such as morphogenetic outcomes, remains a fundamental challenge with far-reaching implications for medicine and synthetic biology. While large language models (LLMs) have enabled natural language as an interface for interpretable control in AI systems, their use as mediators for steering biological or cellular dynamics remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present a functional pipeline that translates natural language prompts into spatial vector fields capable of directing simulated cellular collectives. Our approach combines a large language model with an evolvable neural controller (Prompt-to-Intervention, or P2I), optimized via evolutionary strategies to generate behaviors such as clustering or scattering in a simulated 2D environment. We demonstrate that even with constrained vocabulary and simplified cell models, evolved P2I networks can successfully align cellular dynamics with user-defined goals expressed in plain language. This work offers a complete loop from language input to simulated bioelectric-like intervention to behavioral output, providing a foundation for future systems capable of natural language-driven cellular control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to GECCO Workshop on Bio-Inspired AI (ACM GECCO2025). 13 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Bye-bye, Bluebook? Automating Legal Procedure with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02763v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Legal practice requires careful adherence to procedural rules. In the United States, few are more complex than those found in The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation. Compliance with this system's 500+ pages of byzantine formatting instructions is the raison d'etre of thousands of student law review editors and the bete noire of lawyers everywhere. To evaluate whether large language models (LLMs) are able to adhere to the procedures of such a complicated system, we construct an original dataset of 866 Bluebook tasks and test flagship LLMs from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and DeepSeek. We show (1) that these models produce fully compliant Bluebook citations only 69%-74% of the time and (2) that in-context learning on the Bluebook's underlying system of rules raises accuracy only to 77%. These results caution against using off-the-shelf LLMs to automate aspects of the law where fidelity to procedure is paramount.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic Volume: Quantifying and Detecting both External and Internal Uncertainty in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21239v4)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse tasks by encoding vast amounts of factual knowledge. However, they are still prone to hallucinations, generating incorrect or misleading information, often accompanied by high uncertainty. Existing methods for hallucination detection primarily focus on quantifying internal uncertainty, which arises from missing or conflicting knowledge within the model. However, hallucinations can also stem from external uncertainty, where ambiguous user queries lead to multiple possible interpretations. In this work, we introduce Semantic Volume, a novel mathematical measure for quantifying both external and internal uncertainty in LLMs. Our approach perturbs queries and responses, embeds them in a semantic space, and computes the determinant of the Gram matrix of the embedding vectors, capturing their dispersion as a measure of uncertainty. Our framework provides a generalizable and unsupervised uncertainty detection method without requiring internal access to LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on both external and internal uncertainty detection, demonstrating that our Semantic Volume method consistently outperforms existing baselines in both tasks. Additionally, we provide theoretical insights linking our measure to differential entropy, unifying and extending previous sampling-based uncertainty measures such as the semantic entropy. Semantic Volume is shown to be a robust and interpretable approach to improving the reliability of LLMs by systematically detecting uncertainty in both user queries and model responses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge Graphs for Enhancing Large Language Models in Entity Disambiguation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02737v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have positioned them as a prominent solution for Natural Language Processing tasks. Notably, they can approach these problems in a zero or few-shot manner, thereby eliminating the need for training or fine-tuning task-specific models. However, LLMs face some challenges, including hallucination and the presence of outdated knowledge or missing information from specific domains in the training data. These problems cannot be easily solved by retraining the models with new data as it is a time-consuming and expensive process. To mitigate these issues, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have been proposed as a structured external source of information to enrich LLMs. With this idea, in this work we use KGs to enhance LLMs for zero-shot Entity Disambiguation (ED). For that purpose, we leverage the hierarchical representation of the entities' classes in a KG to gradually prune the candidate space as well as the entities' descriptions to enrich the input prompt with additional factual knowledge. Our evaluation on popular ED datasets shows that the proposed method outperforms non-enhanced and description-only enhanced LLMs, and has a higher degree of adaptability than task-specific models. Furthermore, we conduct an error analysis and discuss the impact of the leveraged KG's semantic expressivity on the ED performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-p...</summary><p>Pre-print submitted to ISWC 2024</p></details> |
| **[FormalMATH: Benchmarking Formal Mathematical Reasoning of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02735v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Formal mathematical reasoning remains a critical challenge for artificial intelligence, hindered by limitations of existing benchmarks in scope and scale. To address this, we present FormalMATH, a large-scale Lean4 benchmark comprising 5,560 formally verified problems spanning from high-school Olympiad challenges to undergraduate-level theorems across diverse domains (e.g., algebra, applied mathematics, calculus, number theory, and discrete mathematics). To mitigate the inefficiency of manual formalization, we introduce a novel human-in-the-loop autoformalization pipeline that integrates: (1) specialized large language models (LLMs) for statement autoformalization, (2) multi-LLM semantic verification, and (3) negation-based disproof filtering strategies using off-the-shelf LLM-based provers. This approach reduces expert annotation costs by retaining 72.09% of statements before manual verification while ensuring fidelity to the original natural-language problems. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM-based theorem provers reveals significant limitations: even the strongest models achieve only 16.46% success rate under practical sampling budgets, exhibiting pronounced domain bias (e.g., excelling in algebra but failing in calculus) and over-reliance on simplified automation tactics. Notably, we identify a counterintuitive inverse relationship between natural-language solution guidance and proof success in chain-of-thought reasoning scenarios, suggesting that human-written informal reasoning introduces noise rather than clarity in the formal reasoning settings. We believe that FormalMATH provides a robust benchmark for benchmarking formal mathematical reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report v1 (33 pages, 8 figures, project page: https://sphere-ai-lab.github.io/FormalMATH/)</p></details> |
| **[Token-Efficient RL for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20834v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose reinforcement learning (RL) strategies tailored for reasoning in large language models (LLMs) under strict memory and compute limits, with a particular focus on compatibility with LoRA fine-tuning. Rather than relying on full-sequence updates or separate critic networks, we design critic-free methods that operate on a small, informative subset of output tokens to reduce memory usage and stabilize training. We introduce S-GRPO, a stochastic variant of Group Relative Policy Optimization, and T-SPMO, a token-level prefix matching approach for fine-grained credit assignment. Applied to Qwen2-1.5B, our methods raise accuracy on the SVAMP benchmark from 46% to over 70% and show strong performance on multi-digit multiplication. Surprisingly, full-token GRPO under LoRA fails to improve over the base model, suggesting that selective token-level optimization may act as an implicit regularizer in low-parameter training regimes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Title...</summary><p>Title updated to "Token-Efficient RL for LLM Reasoning" to better reflect algorithmic focus.

| **[LLMs for Extremely Low-Resource Finno-Ugric Languages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18902v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has predominantly focused on high-resource languages, leaving low-resource languages, such as those in the Finno-Ugric family, significantly underrepresented. This paper addresses this gap by focusing on V\~oro, Livonian, and Komi. We cover almost the entire cycle of LLM creation, from data collection to instruction tuning and evaluation. Our contributions include developing multilingual base and instruction-tuned models; creating evaluation benchmarks, including the smugri-MT-bench multi-turn conversational benchmark; and conducting human evaluation. We intend for this work to promote linguistic diversity, ensuring that lesser-resourced languages can benefit from advancements in NLP.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing LLMs' Clinical Reasoning with Real-World Data from a Nationwide Sepsis Registry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02722v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities across general domains, their effectiveness in real-world clinical practice remains limited. This is likely due to their insufficient exposure to real-world clinical data during training, as such data is typically not included due to privacy concerns. To address this, we propose enhancing the clinical reasoning capabilities of LLMs by leveraging real-world clinical data. We constructed reasoning-intensive questions from a nationwide sepsis registry and fine-tuned Phi-4 on these questions using reinforcement learning, resulting in C-Reason. C-Reason exhibited strong clinical reasoning capabilities on the in-domain test set, as evidenced by both quantitative metrics and expert evaluations. Furthermore, its enhanced reasoning capabilities generalized to a sepsis dataset involving different tasks and patient cohorts, an open-ended consultations on antibiotics use task, and other diseases. Future research should focus on training LLMs with large-scale, multi-disease clinical datasets to develop more powerful, general-purpose clinical reasoning models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Less is More: Efficient Weight Farcasting with 1-Layer Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02714v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Addressing the computational challenges inherent in training large-scale deep neural networks remains a critical endeavor in contemporary machine learning research. While previous efforts have focused on enhancing training efficiency through techniques such as gradient descent with momentum, learning rate scheduling, and weight regularization, the demand for further innovation continues to burgeon as model sizes keep expanding. In this study, we introduce a novel framework which diverges from conventional approaches by leveraging long-term time series forecasting techniques. Our method capitalizes solely on initial and final weight values, offering a streamlined alternative for complex model architectures. We also introduce a novel regularizer that is tailored to enhance the forecasting performance of our approach. Empirical evaluations conducted on synthetic weight sequences and real-world deep learning architectures, including the prominent large language model DistilBERT, demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of forecasting accuracy and computational efficiency. Notably, our framework showcases improved performance while requiring minimal additional computational overhead, thus presenting a promising avenue for accelerating the training process across diverse tasks and architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to DASFAA '25</p></details> |
| **[Voila: Voice-Language Foundation Models for Real-Time Autonomous Interaction and Voice Role-Play](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02707v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A voice AI agent that blends seamlessly into daily life would interact with humans in an autonomous, real-time, and emotionally expressive manner. Rather than merely reacting to commands, it would continuously listen, reason, and respond proactively, fostering fluid, dynamic, and emotionally resonant interactions. We introduce Voila, a family of large voice-language foundation models that make a step towards this vision. Voila moves beyond traditional pipeline systems by adopting a new end-to-end architecture that enables full-duplex, low-latency conversations while preserving rich vocal nuances such as tone, rhythm, and emotion. It achieves a response latency of just 195 milliseconds, surpassing the average human response time. Its hierarchical multi-scale Transformer integrates the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with powerful acoustic modeling, enabling natural, persona-aware voice generation -- where users can simply write text instructions to define the speaker's identity, tone, and other characteristics. Moreover, Voila supports over one million pre-built voices and efficient customization of new ones from brief audio samples as short as 10 seconds. Beyond spoken dialogue, Voila is designed as a unified model for a wide range of voice-based applications, including automatic speech recognition (ASR), Text-to-Speech (TTS), and, with minimal adaptation, multilingual speech translation. Voila is fully open-sourced to support open research and accelerate progress toward next-generation human-machine interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures, Website: https://voila.maitrix.org</p></details> |
| **[From Human Judgements to Predictive Models: Unravelling Acceptability in Code-Mixed Sentences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05572v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current computational approaches for analysing or generating code-mixed sentences do not explicitly model ``naturalness'' or ``acceptability'' of code-mixed sentences, but rely on training corpora to reflect distribution of acceptable code-mixed sentences. Modelling human judgement for the acceptability of code-mixed text can help in distinguishing natural code-mixed text and enable quality-controlled generation of code-mixed text. To this end, we construct Cline - a dataset containing human acceptability judgements for English-Hindi~(en-hi) code-mixed text. Cline is the largest of its kind with 16,642 sentences, consisting of samples sourced from two sources: synthetically generated code-mixed text and samples collected from online social media. Our analysis establishes that popular code-mixing metrics such as CMI, Number of Switch Points, Burstines, which are used to filter/curate/compare code-mixed corpora have low correlation with human acceptability judgements, underlining the necessity of our dataset. Experiments using Cline demonstrate that simple Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models when trained solely using code-mixing metrics as features are outperformed by fine-tuned pre-trained Multilingual Large Language Models (MLLMs). Specifically, among Encoder models XLM-Roberta and Bernice outperform IndicBERT across different configurations. Among Encoder-Decoder models, mBART performs better than mT5, however Encoder-Decoder models are not able to outperform Encoder-only models. Decoder-only models perform the best when compared to all other MLLMS, with Llama 3.2 - 3B models outperforming similarly sized Qwen, Phi models. Comparison with zero and fewshot capabilitites of ChatGPT show that MLLMs fine-tuned on larger data outperform ChatGPT, providing scope for improvement in code-mixed tasks. Zero-shot transfer from En-Hi to En-Te acceptability judgments are better than random baselines.</p></details> |  |

Self-guided interventions, such as the letter-exchange exercise, where participants envision and adopt the perspective of their future selves by exchanging letters with their envisioned future selves, can support career development. However, the broader adoption of such interventions may be limited without structured guidance. To address this, we integrated Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents that simulate participants' future selves into the letter-exchange exercise and evaluated their effectiveness. A one-week experiment (N=36) compared three conditions: (1) participants manually writing replies to themselves from the perspective of their future selves (baseline), (2) future-self agents generating letters to participants, and (3) future-self agents engaging in chat conversations with participants. Results indicated that exchanging letters with future-self agents enhanced participants' engagement during the exercise, while overall benefits of the intervention on future orientation, career self-concept, and psychological support remained comparable across conditions. We discuss design implications for AI-augmented interventions for supporting young adults' career exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 9 figures, Proceedings of the 2025 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (Best Paper Award, Top 1%)</p></details> |
| **[Helping Large Language Models Protect Themselves: An Enhanced Filtering and Summarization System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01315v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent growth in the use of Large Language Models has made them vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial assaults, manipulative prompts, and encoded malicious inputs. Existing countermeasures frequently necessitate retraining models, which is computationally costly and impracticable for deployment. Without the need for retraining or fine-tuning, this study presents a unique defense paradigm that allows LLMs to recognize, filter, and defend against adversarial or malicious inputs on their own. There are two main parts to the suggested framework: (1) A prompt filtering module that uses sophisticated Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including zero-shot classification, keyword analysis, and encoded content detection (e.g. base64, hexadecimal, URL encoding), to detect, decode, and classify harmful inputs; and (2) A summarization module that processes and summarizes adversarial research literature to give the LLM context-aware defense knowledge. This approach strengthens LLMs' resistance to adversarial exploitation by fusing text extraction, summarization, and harmful prompt analysis. According to experimental results, this integrated technique has a 98.71% success rate in identifying harmful patterns, manipulative language structures, and encoded prompts. By employing a modest amount of adversarial research literature as context, the methodology also allows the model to react correctly to harmful inputs with a larger percentage of jailbreak resistance and refusal rate. While maintaining the quality of LLM responses, the framework dramatically increases LLM's resistance to hostile misuse, demonstrating its efficacy as a quick and easy substitute for time-consuming, retraining-based defenses.</p></details> |  |

Despite its importance, one of the few available ways for clinicians to practice SIC is with standardized patients, which is expensive, time-consuming, and inflexible. In this paper, we present SOPHIE, an AI-powered standardized patient simulation and automated feedback system. SOPHIE combines large language models (LLMs), a lifelike virtual avatar, and automated, personalized feedback based on clinical literature to provide remote, on-demand SIC training. In a randomized control study with healthcare students and professionals, SOPHIE users demonstrated significant improvement across three critical SIC domains: Empathize, Be Explicit, and Empower. These results suggest that AI-driven tools can enhance complex interpersonal communication skills, offering scalable, accessible solutions to address a critical gap in clinician education.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables, submitting to New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM)</p></details> |

Across these developments, a key unified paradigm has arisen: Learning from Rewards, where reward signals act as the guiding stars to steer LLM behavior. It has underpinned a wide range of prevalent techniques, such as reinforcement learning (in RLHF, DPO, and GRPO), reward-guided decoding, and post-hoc correction. Crucially, this paradigm enables the transition from passive learning from static data to active learning from dynamic feedback. This endows LLMs with aligned preferences and deep reasoning capabilities. In this survey, we present a comprehensive overview of the paradigm of learning from rewards.

| **[A Survey on Progress in LLM Alignment from the Perspective of Reward Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02666v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values and intentions represents a core challenge in current AI research, where reward mechanism design has become a critical factor in shaping model behavior. This study conducts a comprehensive investigation of reward mechanisms in LLM alignment through a systematic theoretical framework, categorizing their development into three key phases: (1) feedback (diagnosis), (2) reward design (prescription), and (3) optimization (treatment). Through a four-dimensional analysis encompassing construction basis, format, expression, and granularity, this research establishes a systematic classification framework that reveals evolutionary trends in reward modeling. The field of LLM alignment faces several persistent challenges, while recent advances in reward design are driving significant paradigm shifts. Notable developments include the transition from reinforcement learning-based frameworks to novel optimization paradigms, as well as enhanced capabilities to address complex alignment scenarios involving multimodal integration and concurrent task coordination. Finally, this survey outlines promising future research directions for LLM alignment through innovative reward design strategies.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[A Survey of Slow Thinking-based Reasoning LLMs using Reinforced Learning and Inference-time Scaling Law](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02665v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This survey explores recent advancements in reasoning large language models (LLMs) designed to mimic "slow thinking" - a reasoning process inspired by human cognition, as described in Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow. These models, like OpenAI's o1, focus on scaling computational resources dynamically during complex tasks, such as math reasoning, visual reasoning, medical diagnosis, and multi-agent debates. We present the development of reasoning LLMs and list their key technologies. By synthesizing over 100 studies, it charts a path toward LLMs that combine human-like deep thinking with scalable efficiency for reasoning. The review breaks down methods into three categories: (1) test-time scaling dynamically adjusts computation based on task complexity via search and sampling, dynamic verification; (2) reinforced learning refines decision-making through iterative improvement leveraging policy networks, reward models, and self-evolution strategies; and (3) slow-thinking frameworks (e.g., long CoT, hierarchical processes) that structure problem-solving with manageable steps. The survey highlights the challenges and further directions of this domain. Understanding and advancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs is crucial for unlocking their full potential in real-world applications, from scientific discovery to decision support systems.</p></details> |  |

| **[GraphMaster: Automated Graph Synthesis via LLM Agents in Data-Limited Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00711v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The era of foundation models has revolutionized AI research, yet Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) remain constrained by the scarcity of large-scale graph corpora. Traditional graph data synthesis techniques primarily focus on simplistic structural operations, lacking the capacity to generate semantically rich nodes with meaningful textual attributes: a critical limitation for real-world applications. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional text generation capabilities, their direct application to graph synthesis is impeded by context window limitations, hallucination phenomena, and structural consistency challenges. To address these issues, we introduce GraphMaster, the first multi-agent framework specifically designed for graph data synthesis in data-limited environments. GraphMaster orchestrates four specialized LLM agents (Manager, Perception, Enhancement, and Evaluation) that collaboratively optimize the synthesis process through iterative refinement, ensuring both semantic coherence and structural integrity. To rigorously evaluate our approach, we create new data-limited "Sub" variants of six standard graph benchmarks, specifically designed to test synthesis capabilities under realistic constraints. Additionally, we develop a novel interpretability assessment framework that combines human evaluation with a principled Grassmannian manifold-based analysis, providing both qualitative and quantitative measures of semantic coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that GraphMaster significantly outperforms traditional synthesis methods across multiple datasets, establishing a strong foundation for advancing GFMs in data-scarce environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Chemical Reaction and Retrosynthesis Prediction with Large Language Model and Dual-task Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02639v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chemical reaction and retrosynthesis prediction are fundamental tasks in drug discovery. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in many domains. However, directly applying LLMs to these tasks faces two major challenges: (i) lacking a large-scale chemical synthesis-related instruction dataset; (ii) ignoring the close correlation between reaction and retrosynthesis prediction for the existing fine-tuning strategies. To address these challenges, we propose ChemDual, a novel LLM framework for accurate chemical synthesis. Specifically, considering the high cost of data acquisition for reaction and retrosynthesis, ChemDual regards the reaction-and-retrosynthesis of molecules as a related recombination-and-fragmentation process and constructs a large-scale of 4.4 million instruction dataset. Furthermore, ChemDual introduces an enhanced LLaMA, equipped with a multi-scale tokenizer and dual-task learning strategy, to jointly optimize the process of recombination and fragmentation as well as the tasks between reaction and retrosynthesis prediction. Extensive experiments on Mol-Instruction and USPTO-50K datasets demonstrate that ChemDual achieves state-of-the-art performance in both predictions of reaction and retrosynthesis, outperforming the existing conventional single-task approaches and the general open-source LLMs. Through molecular docking analysis, ChemDual generates compounds with diverse and strong protein binding affinity, further highlighting its strong potential in drug design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at IJCAI 2025</p></details> |

Current research predominantly utilizes functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for 3D reconstruction tasks due to its excellent spatial resolution. Nevertheless, the clinical utility of fMRI is limited by its prohibitive costs and inability to support real-time operations. In comparison, electroencephalography (EEG) presents distinct advantages as an affordable, non-invasive, and mobile solution for real-time brain-computer interaction systems. While recent advances in deep learning have enabled remarkable progress in image generation from neural data, decoding EEG signals into structured 3D representations remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that translates EEG recordings into 3D object reconstructions by leveraging neural decoding techniques and generative models. Our approach involves training an EEG encoder to extract spatiotemporal visual features, fine-tuning a large language model to interpret these features into descriptive multimodal outputs, and leveraging generative 3D Gaussians with layout-guided control to synthesize the final 3D structures. Experiments demonstrate that our model captures salient geometric and semantic features, paving the way for applications in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), virtual reality, and neuroprosthetics.

| **[Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning with Attributed Patch Semantic Graph for Automated Patch Correctness Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02629v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated program repair (APR) aims to automatically repair program errors without human intervention, and recent years have witnessed a growing interest on this research topic. While much progress has been made and techniques originating from different disciplines have been proposed, APR techniques generally suffer from the patch overfitting issue, i.e., the generated patches are not genuinely correct despite they pass the employed tests. To alleviate this issue, many research efforts have been devoted for automated patch correctness assessment (APCA). In particular, with the emergence of large language model (LLM) technology, researchers have employed LLM to assess the patch correctness and have obtained the state-of-the-art performance. The literature on APCA has demonstrated the importance of capturing patch semantic and explicitly considering certain code attributes in predicting patch correctness. However, existing LLM-based methods typically treat code as token sequences and ignore the inherent formal structure for code, making it difficult to capture the deep patch semantics. Moreover, these LLM-based methods also do not explicitly account for enough code attributes. To overcome these drawbacks, we in this paper design a novel patch graph representation named attributed patch semantic graph (APSG), which adequately captures the patch semantic and explicitly reflects important patch attributes. To effectively use graph information in APSG, we accordingly propose a new parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method of LLMs named Graph-LoRA. Extensive evaluations have been conducted to evaluate our method, and the results show that compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method improves accuracy and F1 score by 2.3% to 6.6% and 1.8% to 6.1% respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 4 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

Arguments and counter-arguments have been proposed based upon thought experiments, anecdotal conversations between LLMs and humans, statistical linguistic analysis, philosophical considerations, and more. In this brief paper we present a counter-argument based upon a thought experiment and semi-formal considerations leading to an inherent ambiguity barrier which prevents LLMs from having any understanding of what their amazingly fluent dialogues mean.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to NEURAL COMPUTATION</p></details> |

However, anomaly classification-distinguishing different types of anomalies-remains largely unexplored despite its critical importance in real-world inspection tasks. To address this gap, we propose VELM, a novel LLM-based pipeline for anomaly classification. Given the critical importance of inference speed, we first apply an unsupervised anomaly detection method as a vision expert to assess the normality of an observation. If an anomaly is detected, the LLM then classifies its type. A key challenge in developing and evaluating anomaly classification models is the lack of precise annotations of anomaly classes in existing datasets. To address this limitation, we introduce MVTec-AC and VisA-AC, refined versions of the widely used MVTec-AD and VisA datasets, which include accurate anomaly class labels for rigorous evaluation. Our approach achieves a state-of-the-art anomaly classification accuracy of 80.4% on MVTec-AD, exceeding the prior baselines by 5%, and 84% on MVTec-AC, demonstrating the effectiveness of VELM in understanding and categorizing anomalies. We hope our methodology and benchmark inspire further research in anomaly classification, helping bridge the gap between detection and comprehensive anomaly characterization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a spotlight presentation paper at the VAND Workshop, CVPR 2025. 10 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |

Recent advancements have showcased the potential of building intelligent spoken chatbots based on large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we introduce LLaMA-Omni 2, a series of speech language models (SpeechLMs) ranging from 0.5B to 14B parameters, capable of achieving high-quality real-time speech interaction. LLaMA-Omni 2 is built upon the Qwen2.5 series models, integrating a speech encoder and an autoregressive streaming speech decoder. Despite being trained on only 200K multi-turn speech dialogue samples, LLaMA-Omni 2 demonstrates strong performance on several spoken question answering and speech instruction following benchmarks, surpassing previous state-of-the-art SpeechLMs like GLM-4-Voice, which was trained on millions of hours of speech data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[Applying LLMs to Active Learning: Towards Cost-Efficient Cross-Task Text Classification without Manually Labeled Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16892v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning-based classifiers have been used for text classification, such as sentiment analysis, news classification, and toxic comment classification. However, supervised machine learning models often require large amounts of labeled data for training, and manual annotation is both labor-intensive and requires domain-specific knowledge, leading to relatively high annotation costs. To address this issue, we propose an approach that integrates large language models (LLMs) into an active learning framework, achieving high cross-task text classification performance without the need for any manually labeled data. Furthermore, compared to directly applying GPT for classification tasks, our approach retains over 93% of its classification performance while requiring only approximately 6% of the computational time and monetary cost, effectively balancing performance and resource efficiency. These findings provide new insights into the efficient utilization of LLMs and active learning algorithms in text classification tasks, paving the way for their broader application.</p></details> | 11 pages |
| **[The Effectiveness of Large Language Models in Transforming Unstructured Text to Standardized Formats](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02650v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exponential growth of unstructured text data presents a fundamental challenge in modern data management and information retrieval. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural language processing, their potential to transform unstructured text into standardized, structured formats remains largely unexplored - a capability that could revolutionize data processing workflows across industries. This study breaks new ground by systematically evaluating LLMs' ability to convert unstructured recipe text into the structured Cooklang format. Through comprehensive testing of four models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Llama3.1:70b, and Llama3.1:8b), an innovative evaluation approach is introduced that combines traditional metrics (WER, ROUGE-L, TER) with specialized metrics for semantic element identification. Our experiments reveal that GPT-4o with few-shot prompting achieves breakthrough performance (ROUGE-L: 0.9722, WER: 0.0730), demonstrating for the first time that LLMs can reliably transform domain-specific unstructured text into structured formats without extensive training. Although model performance generally scales with size, we uncover surprising potential in smaller models like Llama3.1:8b for optimization through targeted fine-tuning. These findings open new possibilities for automated structured data generation across various domains, from medical records to technical documentation, potentially transforming the way organizations process and utilize unstructured information.</p></details> |  |
| **[FairTranslate: An English-French Dataset for Gender Bias Evaluation in Machine Translation by Overcoming Gender Binarity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15941v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly leveraged for translation tasks but often fall short when translating inclusive language -- such as texts containing the singular 'they' pronoun or otherwise reflecting fair linguistic protocols. Because these challenges span both computational and societal domains, it is imperative to critically evaluate how well LLMs handle inclusive translation with a well-founded framework. This paper presents FairTranslate, a novel, fully human-annotated dataset designed to evaluate non-binary gender biases in machine translation systems from English to French. FairTranslate includes 2418 English-French sentence pairs related to occupations, annotated with rich metadata such as the stereotypical alignment of the occupation, grammatical gender indicator ambiguity, and the ground-truth gender label (male, female, or inclusive). We evaluate four leading LLMs (Gemma2-2B, Mistral-7B, Llama3.1-8B, Llama3.3-70B) on this dataset under different prompting procedures. Our results reveal substantial biases in gender representation across LLMs, highlighting persistent challenges in achieving equitable outcomes in machine translation. These findings underscore the need for focused strategies and interventions aimed at ensuring fair and inclusive language usage in LLM-based translation systems. We make the FairTranslate dataset publicly available on Hugging Face, and disclose the code for all experiments on GitHub.</p></details> | FAccT 2025 |
| **[Towards Cross-Modality Modeling for Time Series Analytics: A Survey in the LLM Era](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02583v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of edge devices has generated an unprecedented volume of time series data across different domains, motivating various well-customized methods. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a new paradigm for time series analytics by leveraging the shared sequential nature of textual data and time series. However, a fundamental cross-modality gap between time series and LLMs exists, as LLMs are pre-trained on textual corpora and are not inherently optimized for time series. Many recent proposals are designed to address this issue. In this survey, we provide an up-to-date overview of LLMs-based cross-modality modeling for time series analytics. We first introduce a taxonomy that classifies existing approaches into four groups based on the type of textual data employed for time series modeling. We then summarize key cross-modality strategies, e.g., alignment and fusion, and discuss their applications across a range of downstream tasks. Furthermore, we conduct experiments on multimodal datasets from different application domains to investigate effective combinations of textual data and cross-modality strategies for enhancing time series analytics. Finally, we suggest several promising directions for future research. This survey is designed for a range of professionals, researchers, and practitioners interested in LLM-based time series modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2025 Survey Track</p></details> |

Leveraging ensemble learning principles, we introduce an Ensemble Multi-Objective RL (EMORL) framework that fine-tunes multiple models with individual objectives while optimizing their aggregation after the training to improve efficiency and flexibility. Our method is the first to aggregate the last hidden states of individual models, incorporating contextual information from multiple objectives. This approach is supported by a hierarchical grid search algorithm that identifies optimal weighted combinations. We evaluate EMORL on counselor reflection generation tasks, using text-scoring LLMs to evaluate the generations and provide rewards during RL fine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments on the PAIR and Psych8k datasets, we demonstrate the advantages of EMORL against existing baselines: significantly lower and more stable training consumption ($17,529\pm 1,650$ data points and $6,573\pm 147.43$ seconds), improved scalability and explainability, and comparable performance across multiple objectives.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, submitted to SIGDIAL 2025 conference</p></details> |
| **[Recursive Decomposition with Dependencies for Generic Divide-and-Conquer Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02576v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning tasks are crucial in many domains, especially in science and engineering. Although large language models (LLMs) have made progress in reasoning tasks using techniques such as chain-of-thought and least-to-most prompting, these approaches still do not effectively scale to complex problems in either their performance or execution time. Moreover, they often require additional supervision for each new task, such as in-context examples. In this work, we introduce Recursive Decomposition with Dependencies (RDD), a scalable divide-and-conquer method for solving reasoning problems that requires less supervision than prior approaches. Our method can be directly applied to a new problem class even in the absence of any task-specific guidance. Furthermore, RDD supports sub-task dependencies, allowing for ordered execution of sub-tasks, as well as an error recovery mechanism that can correct mistakes made in previous steps. We evaluate our approach on two benchmarks with six difficulty levels each and in two in-context settings: one with task-specific examples and one without. Our results demonstrate that RDD outperforms other methods in a compute-matched setting as task complexity increases, while also being more computationally efficient.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Contrastive Feedback for Effective User Simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02560v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for simulating user behavior in the domain of Interactive Information Retrieval has recently gained significant popularity. However, their application and capabilities remain highly debated and understudied. This study explores whether the underlying principles of contrastive training techniques, which have been effective for fine-tuning LLMs, can also be applied beneficially in the area of prompt engineering for user simulations. Previous research has shown that LLMs possess comprehensive world knowledge, which can be leveraged to provide accurate estimates of relevant documents. This study attempts to simulate a knowledge state by enhancing the model with additional implicit contextual information gained during the simulation. This approach enables the model to refine the scope of desired documents further. The primary objective of this study is to analyze how different modalities of contextual information influence the effectiveness of user simulations. Various user configurations were tested, where models are provided with summaries of already judged relevant, irrelevant, or both types of documents in a contrastive manner. The focus of this study is the assessment of the impact of the prompting techniques on the simulated user agent performance. We hereby lay the foundations for leveraging LLMs as part of more realistic simulated users.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Turing Test Is More Relevant Than Ever](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02558v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Turing Test, first proposed by Alan Turing in 1950, has historically served as a benchmark for evaluating artificial intelligence (AI). However, since the release of ELIZA in 1966, and particularly with recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), AI has been claimed to pass the Turing Test. Furthermore, criticism argues that the Turing Test primarily assesses deceptive mimicry rather than genuine intelligence, prompting the continuous emergence of alternative benchmarks. This study argues against discarding the Turing Test, proposing instead using more refined versions of it, for example, by interacting simultaneously with both an AI and human candidate to determine who is who, allowing a longer interaction duration, access to the Internet and other AIs, using experienced people as evaluators, etc. Through systematic experimentation using a web-based platform, we demonstrate that richer, contextually structured testing environments significantly enhance participants' ability to differentiate between AI and human interactions. Namely, we show that, while an off-the-shelf LLM can pass some version of a Turing Test, it fails to do so when faced with a more robust version. Our findings highlight that the Turing Test remains an important and effective method for evaluating AI, provided it continues to adapt as AI technology advances. Additionally, the structured data gathered from these improved interactions provides valuable insights into what humans expect from truly intelligent AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 1 listing, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Model Partitioning for Low-Latency Inference at the Edge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02533v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) based on autoregressive, decoder-only Transformers generate text one token at a time, where a token represents a discrete unit of text. As each newly produced token is appended to the partial output sequence, the length grows and so does the memory and compute load, due to the expanding key-value caches, which store intermediate representations of all previously generated tokens in the multi-head attention (MHA) layer. As this iterative process steadily increases memory and compute demands, layer-based partitioning in resource-constrained edge environments often results in memory overload or high inference latency. To address this and reduce inference latency, we propose a resource-aware Transformer architecture partitioning algorithm, where the partitioning decision is updated at regular intervals during token generation. The approach is myopic in that it is based on instantaneous information about device resource availability and network link bandwidths. When first executed, the algorithm places blocks on devices, and in later executions, it migrates these blocks among devices so that the sum of migration delay and inference delay remains low. Our approach partitions the decoder at the attention head level, co-locating each attention head with its key-value cache and allowing dynamic migrations whenever resources become tight. By allocating different attention heads to different devices, we exploit parallel execution of attention heads and thus achieve substantial reductions in inference delays. Our experiments show that in small-scale settings (3-5 devices), the proposed method achieves within 15 to 20 percent of an exact optimal solver's latency, while in larger-scale tests it achieves notable improvements in inference speed and memory usage compared to state-of-the-art layer-based partitioning approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models as Carriers of Hidden Messages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02481v5)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simple fine-tuning can embed hidden text into large language models (LLMs), which is revealed only when triggered by a specific query. Applications include LLM fingerprinting, where a unique identifier is embedded to verify licensing compliance, and steganography, where the LLM carries hidden messages disclosed through a trigger query. Our work demonstrates that embedding hidden text via fine-tuning, although seemingly secure due to the vast number of potential triggers, is vulnerable to extraction through analysis of the LLM's output decoding process. We introduce an extraction attack called Unconditional Token Forcing (UTF), which iteratively feeds tokens from the LLM's vocabulary to reveal sequences with high token probabilities, indicating hidden text candidates. We also present Unconditional Token Forcing Confusion (UTFC), a defense paradigm that makes hidden text resistant to all known extraction attacks without degrading the general performance of LLMs compared to standard fine-tuning. UTFC has both benign (improving LLM fingerprinting) and malign applications (using LLMs to create covert communication channels).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted on SECRYPT 2025 Conference.

Nonetheless, the success of ICL largely hinges on the choice of few-shot demonstration examples, making the selection process increasingly crucial. Existing methods have delved into optimizing the quantity and semantic similarity of these examples to improve ICL performances. However, our preliminary experiments indicate that the effectiveness of ICL is limited by the length of the input context. Moreover, varying combinations of few-shot demonstration examples can significantly boost accuracy across different test samples. To address this, we propose a novel method named parallel in-context learning (ParaICL) that effectively utilizes all demonstration examples without exceeding the manageable input context length. ParaICL employs parallel batching to distribute demonstration examples into different batches according to the semantic similarities of the questions in the demonstrations to the test question. It then computes normalized batch semantic scores for each batch. A weighted average semantic objective, constrained by adaptive plausibility, is applied to select the most appropriate tokens. Through extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of ParaICL and conduct ablation studies to underscore its design rationale. We further demonstrate that ParaICL can seamlessly integrate with existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NAACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[Mapping the Italian Telegram Ecosystem: Communities, Toxicity, and Hate Speech](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19594v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Telegram has become a major space for political discourse and alternative media. However, its lack of moderation allows misinformation, extremism, and toxicity to spread. While prior research focused on these particular phenomena or topics, these have mostly been examined separately, and a broader understanding of the Telegram ecosystem is still missing. In this work, we fill this gap by conducting a large-scale analysis of the Italian Telegram sphere, leveraging a dataset of 186 million messages from 13,151 chats collected in 2023. Using network analysis, Large Language Models, and toxicity detection tools, we examine how different thematic communities form, align ideologically, and engage in harmful discourse within the Italian cultural context. Results show strong thematic and ideological homophily. We also identify mixed ideological communities where far-left and far-right rhetoric coexist on particular geopolitical issues. Beyond political analysis, we find that toxicity, rather than being isolated in a few extreme chats, appears widely normalized within highly toxic communities. Moreover, we find that Italian discourse primarily targets Black people, Jews, and gay individuals independently of the topic. Finally, we uncover common trend of intra-national hostility, where Italians often attack other Italians, reflecting regional and intra-regional cultural conflicts that can be traced back to old historical divisions. This study provides the first large-scale mapping of the Italian Telegram ecosystem, offering insights into ideological interactions, toxicity, and identity-targets of hate and contributing to research on online toxicity across different cultural and linguistic contexts on Telegram.</p></details> |  |

However, insecure defaults and misconfigurations often expose LLM services to the public Internet, posing significant security and system engineering risks. Aims: This study aims to unveil the current landscape of public-facing LLM deployments in the wild through a large-scale empirical study, focusing on service prevalence, exposure characteristics, systemic vulnerabilities, and associated risks. Method: We conducted an Internet-wide measurement to identify public-facing LLM deployments across 15 frameworks, discovering 320,102 services. We extracted 158 unique API endpoints, grouped into 12 functional categories based on capabilities and security risks. We further analyzed configurations, authentication practices, and geographic distributions, revealing deployment trends and systemic issues in real-world LLM system engineering. Results: Our study shows that public LLM deployments are rapidly growing but often insecure. Among all endpoints, we observe widespread use of insecure protocols, poor TLS configurations, and unauthenticated access to critical operations. Security risks, including model disclosure, system leakage, and unauthorized access, are pervasive, highlighting the need for secure-by-default frameworks and stronger deployment practices. Conclusions: Public-facing LLM deployments suffer from widespread security and configuration flaws, exposing services to misuse, model theft, resource hijacking, and remote exploitation. Strengthening default security, deployment practices, and operational standards is critical for the growing self-hosted LLM ecosystem.</p></details> |  |

The rise of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), introduces new opportunities to automate automotive software development tasks such as requirement analysis and code generation. However, due to the complexity of automotive systems, where software components must interact with each other seamlessly, challenges remain in software integration and system-level validation. In this paper, we propose to combine GenAI with model-driven engineering to automate automotive software development. Our approach uses LLMs to convert free-text requirements into event chain descriptions and to generate platform-independent software components that realize the required functionality. At the same time, formal models are created based on event chain descriptions to support system validation and the generation of integration code for integrating generated software components in the whole vehicle system through middleware. This approach increases development automation while enabling formal analysis to improve system reliability. As a proof of concept, we used GPT-4o to implement our method and tested it in the CARLA simulation environment with ROS2 middleware. We evaluated the system in a simple Autonomous Emergency Braking scenario.</p></details> |  |

To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel Knowledge Graph-based RAG framework with a hierarchical knowledge retriever, termed KG-Retriever. The retrieval indexing in KG-Retriever is constructed on a hierarchical index graph that consists of a knowledge graph layer and a collaborative document layer. The associative nature of graph structures is fully utilized to strengthen intra-document and inter-document connectivity, thereby fundamentally alleviating the information fragmentation problem and meanwhile improving the retrieval efficiency in cross-document retrieval of LLMs. With the coarse-grained collaborative information from neighboring documents and concise information from the knowledge graph, KG-Retriever achieves marked improvements on five public QA datasets, showing the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed RAG framework.</p></details> |  |

As many now operate at comparable levels of capability, the real race is not about having the biggest model but optimizing the surrounding ecosystem, including data quality and management, computational efficiency, latency, and evaluation frameworks. This review article delves into these critical differentiators that ensure modern AI services are efficient and profitable.</p></details> | 4 pages |
| **[SEFE: Superficial and Essential Forgetting Eliminator for Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02486v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning (MCIT) aims to enable Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to incrementally learn new tasks without catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we explore forgetting in this context, categorizing it into superficial forgetting and essential forgetting. Superficial forgetting refers to cases where the model's knowledge may not be genuinely lost, but its responses to previous tasks deviate from expected formats due to the influence of subsequent tasks' answer styles, making the results unusable. By contrast, essential forgetting refers to situations where the model provides correctly formatted but factually inaccurate answers, indicating a true loss of knowledge. Assessing essential forgetting necessitates addressing superficial forgetting first, as severe superficial forgetting can obscure the model's knowledge state. Hence, we first introduce the Answer Style Diversification (ASD) paradigm, which defines a standardized process for transforming data styles across different tasks, unifying their training sets into similarly diversified styles to prevent superficial forgetting caused by style shifts. Building on this, we propose RegLoRA to mitigate essential forgetting. RegLoRA stabilizes key parameters where prior knowledge is primarily stored by applying regularization, enabling the model to retain existing competencies. Experimental results demonstrate that our overall method, SEFE, achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Hybrid Reward Scheduling via Large Language Models for Robotic Skill Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02483v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling a high-degree-of-freedom robot to learn specific skills is a challenging task due to the complexity of robotic dynamics. Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising solution; however, addressing such problems requires the design of multiple reward functions to account for various constraints in robotic motion. Existing approaches typically sum all reward components indiscriminately to optimize the RL value function and policy. We argue that this uniform inclusion of all reward components in policy optimization is inefficient and limits the robot's learning performance. To address this, we propose an Automated Hybrid Reward Scheduling (AHRS) framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs). This paradigm dynamically adjusts the learning intensity of each reward component throughout the policy optimization process, enabling robots to acquire skills in a gradual and structured manner. Specifically, we design a multi-branch value network, where each branch corresponds to a distinct reward component. During policy optimization, each branch is assigned a weight that reflects its importance, and these weights are automatically computed based on rules designed by LLMs. The LLM generates a rule set in advance, derived from the task description, and during training, it selects a weight calculation rule from the library based on language prompts that evaluate the performance of each branch. Experimental results demonstrate that the AHRS method achieves an average 6.48% performance improvement across multiple high-degree-of-freedom robotic tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unveiling the Mechanisms of Explicit CoT Training: How CoT Enhances Reasoning Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04667v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into training large language models (LLMs) has advanced their reasoning capabilities, yet the mechanisms by which CoT enhances generalization remain poorly understood. This work investigates (1) \textit{how} CoT training reshapes internal model representations and (2) \textit{why} it improves both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) reasoning generalization. Through controlled experiments and theoretical analysis, we derive the following key insights. \textbf{1)} Structural Advantage: CoT training internalizes reasoning into a two-stage generalizing circuit, where the number of stages corresponds to the explicit reasoning steps during training. Notably, CoT-trained models resolve intermediate results at shallower layers compared to non-CoT counterparts, freeing up deeper layers to specialize in subsequent reasoning steps. \textbf{2)} Theoretical Analysis: the information-theoretic generalization bounds via distributional divergence can be decomposed into ID and OOD components. While ID error diminishes with sufficient training regardless of CoT, OOD error critically depends on CoT: Non-CoT training fails to generalize to OOD samples due to unseen reasoning patterns, whereas CoT training achieves near-perfect OOD generalization by mastering subtasks and reasoning compositions during training. The identified mechanisms explain our experimental results: CoT training accelerates convergence and enhances generalization from ID to both ID and OOD scenarios while maintaining robust performance even with tolerable noise. These findings are further validated on complex real-world datasets. This paper offers valuable insights for designing CoT strategies to enhance LLM reasoning robustness.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, progress in large vision-language models has created new opportunities for multimodal retrieval. In response, we have updated the Tevatron toolkit, introducing a unified pipeline that enables researchers to explore retriever models at different scales, across multiple languages, and with various modalities. This demo paper highlights the toolkit's key features, bridging academia and industry by supporting efficient training, inference, and evaluation of neural retrievers. We showcase a unified dense retriever achieving strong multilingual and multimodal effectiveness, and conduct a cross-modality zero-shot study to demonstrate its research potential. Alongside, we release OmniEmbed, to the best of our knowledge, the first embedding model that unifies text, image document, video, and audio retrieval, serving as a baseline for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in SIGIR 2025 (Demo)</p></details> |
| **[Incentivizing Inclusive Contributions in Model Sharing Markets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02462v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While data plays a crucial role in training contemporary AI models, it is acknowledged that valuable public data will be exhausted in a few years, directing the world's attention towards the massive decentralized private data. However, the privacy-sensitive nature of raw data and lack of incentive mechanism prevent these valuable data from being fully exploited. Addressing these challenges, this paper proposes inclusive and incentivized personalized federated learning (iPFL), which incentivizes data holders with diverse purposes to collaboratively train personalized models without revealing raw data. iPFL constructs a model-sharing market by solving a graph-based training optimization and incorporates an incentive mechanism based on game theory principles. Theoretical analysis shows that iPFL adheres to two key incentive properties: individual rationality and truthfulness. Empirical studies on eleven AI tasks (e.g., large language models' instruction-following tasks) demonstrate that iPFL consistently achieves the highest economic utility, and better or comparable model performance compared to baseline methods. We anticipate that our iPFL can serve as a valuable technique for boosting future AI models on decentralized private data while making everyone satisfied.</p></details> |  |

However, such work tends to focus on single axes of bias (most often gender) and the English language. Addressing these limitations, we contribute the first study of multilingual intersecting country and gender biases, with a focus on occupation recommendations generated by large language models. We construct a benchmark of prompts in English, Spanish and German, where we systematically vary country and gender, using 25 countries and four pronoun sets. Then, we evaluate a suite of 5 Llama-based models on this benchmark, finding that LLMs encode significant gender and country biases. Notably, we find that even when models show parity for gender or country individually, intersectional occupational biases based on both country and gender persist. We also show that the prompting language significantly affects bias, and instruction-tuned models consistently demonstrate the lowest and most stable levels of bias. Our findings highlight the need for fairness researchers to use intersectional and multilingual lenses in their work.</p></details> |  |

A Randomized Study with 90+ Novice Counselors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02428v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training more counselors, from clinical students to peer supporters, can help meet the demand for accessible mental health support; however, current training approaches remain resource-intensive and difficult to scale effectively. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising solutions for growing counseling skills training through simulated practice and automated feedback. Despite successes in aligning LLMs with expert-counselor annotations, we do not know whether LLM-based counseling training tools -- such as AI patients that simulate real-world challenges and generative AI feedback with suggested alternatives and rationales -- actually lead to improvements in novice counselor skill development. We develop CARE, an LLM-simulated practice and feedback system, and randomize 94 novice counselors to practice using an AI patient, either alone or with AI feedback, measuring changes in their behavioral performance, self-assessments, and qualitative learning takeaways. Our results show the practice-and-feedback group improved in their use of reflections and questions (d=0.32-0.39, p$<$0.05). In contrast, the group that practiced with an AI patient alone did not show improvements, and in the case of empathy, actually had worse uses across time (d=$-$0.52, p=0.001) and when compared against the practice-and-feedback group (d=0.72, p=0.001). Participants' qualitative self-reflections revealed key differences: the practice-and-feedback group adopted a client-centered approach involving listening to and validating feelings, while the practice-alone group remained solution-oriented but delayed offering suggestions until gathering more information. Overall, these results suggest that LLM-based training systems can promote effective skill development, but that combining both simulated practice and structured feedback is critical.</p></details> | <details><summary>main ...</summary><p>main paper is 11 pages, with methods it is 18 pages, with appendix and references it is 33 pages</p></details> |

These novel models provide plausible versatility, but are criticized for improper physical motion, shading and illumination, camera motion, and temporal consistency. The film industry relies on manually-edited Computer-Generated Imagery (CGI) using 3D modeling software. Human-directed 3D synthetic videos address these shortcomings, but require tight collaboration between movie makers and 3D rendering experts. We introduce an automatic synthetic video generation pipeline based on Vision Large Language Model (VLM) agent collaborations. Given a language description of a video, multiple VLM agents direct various processes of the generation pipeline. They cooperate to create Blender scripts which render a video following the given description. Augmented with Blender-based movie making knowledge, the Director agent decomposes the text-based video description into sub-processes. For each sub-process, the Programmer agent produces Python-based Blender scripts based on function composing and API calling. The Reviewer agent, with knowledge of video reviewing, character motion coordinates, and intermediate screenshots, provides feedback to the Programmer agent. The Programmer agent iteratively improves scripts to yield the best video outcome. Our generated videos show better quality than commercial video generation models in five metrics on video quality and instruction-following performance. Our framework outperforms other approaches in a user study on quality, consistency, and rationality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025 AI4CC Workshop</p></details> |

While recent advances in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), such as Large Language Models (LLMs), have been applied to semantic communication designs, the potential of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate an LMM-based vehicle AI assistant using a Large Language and Vision Assistant (LLaVA) and propose a task-oriented semantic communication framework to facilitate efficient interaction between users and cloud servers. To reduce computational demands and shorten response time, we optimize LLaVA's image slicing to selectively focus on areas of utmost interest to users. Additionally, we assess the importance of image patches by combining objective and subjective user attention, adjusting energy usage for transmitting semantic information. This strategy optimizes resource utilization, ensuring precise transmission of critical information. We construct a Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset for traffic scenarios to evaluate effectiveness. Experimental results show that our semantic communication framework significantly increases accuracy in answering questions under the same channel conditions, performing particularly well in environments with poor Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR). Accuracy can be improved by 13.4% at an SNR of 12dB and 33.1% at 10dB, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Balancing Pipeline Parallelism with Vocabulary Parallelism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05288v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pipeline parallelism is widely used to scale the training of transformer-based large language models, various works have been done to improve its throughput and memory footprint. In this paper, we address a frequently overlooked issue: the vocabulary layers can cause imbalanced computation and memory usage across pipeline stages, worsening pipeline bubbles and the memory bottleneck. To tackle this, we partition the vocabulary layers evenly across pipeline devices and group the computation into pipeline passes. To reduce the activation memory overhead, we propose several algorithms to reduce communication barriers within vocabulary layers. Additionally, we utilize a generalizable method to integrate Vocabulary Parallelism with existing pipeline schedules. By combining these techniques, our methods effectively balance the computation and parameter memory, with only a small constant activation memory overhead. Notably, when combined with activation memory-balanced schedules like V-Half, our approach achieves perfect balance in both memory and computation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves computation and memory balance regardless of the vocabulary size, resulting in a 5% to 51% improvement in throughput compared to naive approaches, meanwhile significantly reducing peak memory usage especially for large vocabulary scenarios. Our implementation is open-sourced at https://github.com/sail-sg/VocabularyParallelism .</p></details> |  |

This paper aims to investigate the fine-tuning of code-generating LLMs using Reinforcement Learning and Direct Preference Optimization, further improving their performance. To achieve this, we enhance the training data for the reward model with the help of symbolic execution techniques, ensuring more comprehensive and objective data. With symbolic execution, we create a custom dataset that better captures the nuances in code evaluation. Our reward models, fine-tuned on this dataset, demonstrate significant improvements over the baseline, CodeRL, in estimating the quality of generated code. Our code-generating LLMs, trained with the help of reward model feedback, achieve similar results compared to the CodeRL benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimating Commonsense Scene Composition on Belief Scene Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02405v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work establishes the concept of commonsense scene composition, with a focus on extending Belief Scene Graphs by estimating the spatial distribution of unseen objects. Specifically, the commonsense scene composition capability refers to the understanding of the spatial relationships among related objects in the scene, which in this article is modeled as a joint probability distribution for all possible locations of the semantic object class. The proposed framework includes two variants of a Correlation Information (CECI) model for learning probability distributions: (i) a baseline approach based on a Graph Convolutional Network, and (ii) a neuro-symbolic extension that integrates a spatial ontology based on Large Language Models (LLMs). Furthermore, this article provides a detailed description of the dataset generation process for such tasks. Finally, the framework has been validated through multiple runs on simulated data, as well as in a real-world indoor environment, demonstrating its ability to spatially interpret scenes across different room types.</p></details> | Accepted at ICRA25 |
| **[Optimizing Chain-of-Thought Reasoners via Gradient Variance Minimization in Rejection Sampling and RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02391v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models (LLMs) can be formalized as a latent variable problem, where the model needs to generate intermediate reasoning steps. While prior approaches such as iterative reward-ranked fine-tuning (RAFT) have relied on such formulations, they typically apply uniform inference budgets across prompts, which fails to account for variability in difficulty and convergence behavior. This work identifies the main bottleneck in CoT training as inefficient stochastic gradient estimation due to static sampling strategies. We propose GVM-RAFT, a prompt-specific Dynamic Sample Allocation Strategy designed to minimize stochastic gradient variance under a computational budget constraint. The method dynamically allocates computational resources by monitoring prompt acceptance rates and stochastic gradient norms, ensuring that the resulting gradient variance is minimized. Our theoretical analysis shows that the proposed dynamic sampling strategy leads to accelerated convergence guarantees under suitable conditions. Experiments on mathematical reasoning show that GVM-RAFT achieves a 2-4x speedup and considerable accuracy improvements over vanilla RAFT. The proposed dynamic sampling strategy is general and can be incorporated into other reinforcement learning algorithms, such as GRPO, leading to similar improvements in convergence and test accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/RLHFlow/GVM.</p></details> |  |
| **[RM-R1: Reward Modeling as Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02387v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward modeling is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, especially through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). To provide accurate reward signals, a reward model (RM) should stimulate deep thinking and conduct interpretable reasoning before assigning a score or a judgment. However, existing RMs either produce opaque scalar scores or directly generate the prediction of a preferred answer, making them struggle to integrate natural language critiques, thus lacking interpretability. Inspired by recent advances of long chain-of-thought (CoT) on reasoning-intensive tasks, we hypothesize and validate that integrating reasoning capabilities into reward modeling significantly enhances RM's interpretability and performance. In this work, we introduce a new class of generative reward models -- Reasoning Reward Models (ReasRMs) -- which formulate reward modeling as a reasoning task. We propose a reasoning-oriented training pipeline and train a family of ReasRMs, RM-R1. The training consists of two key stages: (1) distillation of high-quality reasoning chains and (2) reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. RM-R1 improves LLM rollouts by self-generating reasoning traces or chat-specific rubrics and evaluating candidate responses against them. Empirically, our models achieve state-of-the-art or near state-of-the-art performance of generative RMs across multiple comprehensive reward model benchmarks, outperforming much larger open-weight models (e.g., Llama3.1-405B) and proprietary ones (e.g., GPT-4o) by up to 13.8%. Beyond final performance, we perform thorough empirical analysis to understand the key ingredients of successful ReasRM training. To facilitate future research, we release six ReasRM models along with code and data at https://github.com/RM-R1-UIUC/RM-R1.</p></details> | 23 pages, 7 figures |

To address this, we propose EntroLLM, a novel compression framework that integrates mixed quantization with entropy coding to reduce storage overhead while maintaining model accuracy. Our method applies a layer-wise mixed quantization scheme - choosing between symmetric and asymmetric quantization based on individual layer weight distributions - to optimize compressibility. We then employ Huffman encoding for lossless compression of the quantized weights, significantly reducing memory bandwidth requirements. Furthermore, we introduce parallel Huffman decoding, which enables efficient retrieval of encoded weights during inference, ensuring minimal latency impact. Our experiments on edge-compatible LLMs, including smolLM-1.7B-Instruct, phi3-mini-4k-Instruct, and mistral-7B-Instruct, demonstrate that EntroLLM achieves up to $30%$ storage reduction compared to uint8 models and up to $65%$ storage reduction compared to uint4 models, while preserving perplexity and accuracy, on language benchmark tasks. We further show that our method enables $31.9%$ - $146.6%$ faster inference throughput on memory-bandwidth-limited edge devices, such as NVIDIA Jetson P3450, by reducing the required data movement. The proposed approach requires no additional re-training and is fully compatible with existing post-training quantization methods, making it a practical solution for edge LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 1 reference page.

Traditional approaches rely on manually crafted annotations -- labeling functions as sources or sinks -- to track data flows, e.g., ensuring that allocated memory is eventually freed, and code analysis tools such as CodeQL, Infer, or Cooddy can use function specifications, but manual annotation is laborious and error-prone, especially for large or third-party libraries. We present LAMeD (LLM-generated Annotations for Memory leak Detection), a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate function-specific annotations. When integrated with analyzers such as Cooddy, LAMeD significantly improves memory leak detection and reduces path explosion. We also suggest directions for extending LAMeD to broader code analysis.</p></details> |  |

However, these models predominantly focus on English, leaving multilingual embedding capabilities largely unexplored. To address this limitation, we present LUSIFER, a novel zero-shot approach that adapts LLM-based embedding models for multilingual tasks without requiring multilingual supervision. LUSIFER's architecture combines a multilingual encoder, serving as a language-universal learner, with an LLM-based embedding model optimized for embedding-specific tasks. These components are seamlessly integrated through a minimal set of trainable parameters that act as a connector, effectively transferring the multilingual encoder's language understanding capabilities to the specialized embedding model. Additionally, to comprehensively evaluate multilingual embedding performance, we introduce a new benchmark encompassing 5 primary embedding tasks, 123 diverse datasets, and coverage across 14 languages. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that LUSIFER significantly enhances the multilingual performance across various embedding tasks, particularly for medium and low-resource languages, without requiring explicit multilingual training data.</p></details> |  |

Traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches, while effective in static settings, face significant limitations in adapting to evolving spam tactics, addressing class imbalance, and managing data scarcity. These challenges necessitate innovative approaches that reduce dependency on extensive labeled datasets and frequent retraining. This study investigates the effectiveness of Zero-Shot Learning using FLAN-T5, combined with advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as BERT for email spam detection. By employing BERT to preprocess and extract critical information from email content, and FLAN-T5 to classify emails in a Zero-Shot framework, the proposed approach aims to address the limitations of traditional spam detection systems. The integration of FLAN-T5 and BERT enables robust spam detection without relying on extensive labeled datasets or frequent retraining, making it highly adaptable to unseen spam patterns and adversarial environments. This research highlights the potential of leveraging zero-shot learning and NLPs for scalable and efficient spam detection, providing insights into their capability to address the dynamic and challenging nature of spam detection tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, despite their rapid proliferation, the applications of LLMs in telecommunications remain limited, often relying on general-purpose models that lack domain-specific specialization. This lack of specialization results in underperformance, particularly when dealing with telecommunications-specific technical terminology and their associated mathematical representations. This paper addresses this gap by first creating and disseminating Tele-Data, a comprehensive dataset of telecommunications material curated from relevant sources, and Tele-Eval, a large-scale question-and-answer dataset tailored to the domain. Through extensive experiments, we explore the most effective training techniques for adapting LLMs to the telecommunications domain, ranging from examining the division of expertise across various telecommunications aspects to employing parameter-efficient techniques. We also investigate how models of different sizes behave during adaptation and analyze the impact of their training data on this behavior. Leveraging these findings, we develop and open-source Tele-LLMs, the first series of language models ranging from 1B to 8B parameters, specifically tailored for telecommunications. Our evaluations demonstrate that these models outperform their general-purpose counterparts on Tele-Eval and telecommunications-related literature tasks while retaining their previously acquired capabilities, thus avoiding the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon.</p></details> |  |

While scaling laws have provided critical insights into performance improvements through increasing model and dataset size, we emphasize the significant limitations of this approach, particularly in terms of computational inefficiency, environmental impact, and deployment constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a holistic framework for downscaling LLMs that seeks to maintain performance while drastically reducing resource demands. This paper outlines practical strategies for transitioning away from traditional scaling paradigms, advocating for a more sustainable, efficient, and accessible approach to LLM development.</p></details> |  |

However, an overlooked challenge is AI-polished text, where human-written content undergoes subtle refinements using AI tools. This raises a critical question: should minimally polished text be classified as AI-generated? Such classification can lead to false plagiarism accusations and misleading claims about AI prevalence in online content. In this study, we systematically evaluate twelve state-of-the-art AI-text detectors using our AI-Polished-Text Evaluation (APT-Eval) dataset, which contains 14.7K samples refined at varying AI-involvement levels. Our findings reveal that detectors frequently flag even minimally polished text as AI-generated, struggle to differentiate between degrees of AI involvement, and exhibit biases against older and smaller models. These limitations highlight the urgent need for more nuanced detection methodologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 18 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Passive detection methods usually face high false positives, while active watermarking techniques using logits or sampling manipulation offer more effective protection. Existing LLM watermarking methods, though effective on unaltered content, suffer significant performance drops when the text is modified and could introduce biases that degrade LLM performance in downstream tasks. These methods fail to achieve an optimal tradeoff between text quality and robustness, particularly due to the lack of end-to-end optimization of the encoder and decoder. In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end logits perturbation method for watermarking LLM-generated text. By jointly optimization, our approach achieves a better balance between quality and robustness. To address non-differentiable operations in the end-to-end training pipeline, we introduce an online prompting technique that leverages the on-the-fly LLM as a differentiable surrogate. Our method achieves superior robustness, outperforming distortion-free methods by 37-39% under paraphrasing and 17.2% on average, while maintaining text quality on par with these distortion-free methods in terms of text perplexity and downstream tasks. Our method can be easily generalized to different LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Illusion of Role Separation: Hidden Shortcuts in LLM Role Learning (and How to Fix Them)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00626v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) that integrate multiple input roles (e.g., system instructions, user queries, external tool outputs) are increasingly prevalent in practice. Ensuring that the model accurately distinguishes messages from each role -- a concept we call \emph{role separation} -- is crucial for consistent multi-role behavior. Although recent work often targets state-of-the-art prompt injection defenses, it remains unclear whether such methods truly teach LLMs to differentiate roles or merely memorize known triggers. In this paper, we examine \emph{role-separation learning}: the process of teaching LLMs to robustly distinguish system and user tokens. Through a \emph{simple, controlled experimental framework}, we find that fine-tuned models often rely on two proxies for role identification: (1) task type exploitation, and (2) proximity to begin-of-text. Although data augmentation can partially mitigate these shortcuts, it generally leads to iterative patching rather than a deeper fix. To address this, we propose reinforcing \emph{invariant signals} that mark role boundaries by adjusting token-wise cues in the model's input encoding. In particular, manipulating position IDs helps the model learn clearer distinctions and reduces reliance on superficial proxies. By focusing on this mechanism-centered perspective, our work illuminates how LLMs can more reliably maintain consistent multi-role behavior without merely memorizing known prompts or triggers.</p></details> |  |

However, AVER remains challenging due to the inherent ambiguity of emotional expressions, cross-modal expressive disparities, and the scarcity of reliably annotated data. Recent self-supervised AVER approaches have introduced strong multimodal representations, yet they predominantly rely on modality-specific encoders and coarse content-level alignment, limiting fine-grained emotional semantic modeling. To address these issues, we propose VAEmo, an efficient two-stage framework for emotion-centric joint VA representation learning with external knowledge injection. In Stage 1, a unified and lightweight representation network is pre-trained on large-scale speaker-centric VA corpora via masked reconstruction and contrastive objectives, mitigating the modality gap and learning expressive, complementary representations without emotion labels. In Stage 2, multimodal large language models automatically generate detailed affective descriptions according to our well-designed chain-of-thought prompting for only a small subset of VA samples; these rich textual semantics are then injected by aligning their corresponding embeddings with VA representations through dual-path contrastive learning, further bridging the emotion gap. Extensive experiments on multiple downstream AVER benchmarks show that VAEmo achieves state-of-the-art performance with a compact design, highlighting the benefit of unified cross-modal encoding and emotion-aware semantic guidance for efficient, generalizable VA emotion representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source code and pre-trained models will be available at https://github.com/MSA-LMC/VAEmo</p></details> |
| **[From Course to Skill: Evaluating LLM Performance in Curricular Analytics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02324v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Curricular analytics (CA) -- systematic analysis of curricula data to inform program and course refinement -- becomes an increasingly valuable tool to help institutions align academic offerings with evolving societal and economic demands. Large language models (LLMs) are promising for handling large-scale, unstructured curriculum data, but it remains uncertain how reliably LLMs can perform CA tasks. In this paper, we systematically evaluate four text alignment strategies based on LLMs or traditional NLP methods for skill extraction, a core task in CA. Using a stratified sample of 400 curriculum documents of different types and a human-LLM collaborative evaluation framework, we find that retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to be the top-performing strategy across all types of curriculum documents, while zero-shot prompting performs worse than traditional NLP methods in most cases. Our findings highlight the promise of LLMs in analyzing brief and abstract curriculum documents, but also reveal that their performance can vary significantly depending on model selection and prompting strategies. This underscores the importance of carefully evaluating the performance of LLM-based strategies before large-scale deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[HyperTree Planning: Enhancing LLM Reasoning via Hierarchical Thinking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02322v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements have significantly enhanced the performance of large language models (LLMs) in tackling complex reasoning tasks, achieving notable success in domains like mathematical and logical reasoning. However, these methods encounter challenges with complex planning tasks, primarily due to extended reasoning steps, diverse constraints, and the challenge of handling multiple distinct sub-tasks. To address these challenges, we propose HyperTree Planning (HTP), a novel reasoning paradigm that constructs hypertree-structured planning outlines for effective planning. The hypertree structure enables LLMs to engage in hierarchical thinking by flexibly employing the divide-and-conquer strategy, effectively breaking down intricate reasoning steps, accommodating diverse constraints, and managing multiple distinct sub-tasks in a well-organized manner. We further introduce an autonomous planning framework that completes the planning process by iteratively refining and expanding the hypertree-structured planning outlines. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of HTP, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on the TravelPlanner benchmark with Gemini-1.5-Pro, resulting in a 3.6 times performance improvement over o1-preview.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2406.14228 by other authors</p></details> |

Existing methods primarily only consider the global features of the entire volume, making it struggle to focus on specific regions and potentially missing abnormalities. To address this issue, we propose Reg2RG, the first region-guided referring and grounding framework for CT report generation, which enhances diagnostic performance by focusing on anatomical regions within the volume. Specifically, we utilize masks from a universal segmentation module to capture local features for each referring region. A local feature decoupling (LFD) strategy is proposed to preserve the local high-resolution details with little computational overhead. Then the local features are integrated with global features to capture inter-regional relationships within a cohesive context. Moreover, we propose a novel region-report alignment (RRA) training strategy. It leverages the recognition of referring regions to guide the generation of region-specific reports, enhancing the model's referring and grounding capabilities while also improving the report's interpretability. A large language model (LLM) is further employed as the language decoder to generate reports from integrated visual features, facilitating region-level comprehension. Extensive experiments on two large-scale chest CT-report datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method, which outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in terms of both natural language generation and clinical efficacy metrics while preserving promising interpretability. The code is available at https://github.com/zhi-xuan-chen/Reg2RG.</p></details> | 10 pages |

In this paper, we propose a practical invocation evaluation metric called AttenHScore, which calculates the accumulation and propagation of hallucinations during the generation process of small LMs, continuously amplifying potential reasoning errors. By dynamically adjusting the detection threshold, we achieve more accurate real-time invocation of large LMs. Additionally, considering the limited reasoning capacity of small LMs, we leverage uncertainty-aware knowledge reorganization to assist them better capture critical information from different text chunks. Extensive experiments reveal that our AttenHScore outperforms most baseline in enhancing real-time hallucination detection capabilities across multiple QA datasets, especially when addressing complex queries. Moreover, our strategies eliminate the need for additional model training and display flexibility in adapting to various transformer-based LMs.</p></details> |  |

Current alignment techniques adopt a one-size-fits-all approach that fails to accommodate users' diverse backgrounds and needs. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of personalized alignment-a paradigm that enables LLMs to adapt their behavior within ethical boundaries based on individual preferences. We propose a unified framework comprising preference memory management, personalized generation, and feedback-based alignment, systematically analyzing implementation approaches and evaluating their effectiveness across various scenarios. By examining current techniques, potential risks, and future challenges, this survey provides a structured foundation for developing more adaptable and ethically-aligned LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Surve...</summary><p>Survey paper; 11 pages; Literature reviewed up to ICLR 2025</p></details> |

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to integrate generative large language models (LLMs) into SLR tasks. We propose a novel Generative Sign-description Prompts Multi-positive Contrastive learning (GSP-MC) method that leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with domain-specific LLMs, incorporating multi-step prompt engineering and expert-validated sign language corpora to produce precise multipart descriptions. The GSP-MC method also employs a dual-encoder architecture to bidirectionally align hierarchical skeleton features with multiple text descriptions (global, synonym, and part level) through probabilistic matching. Our approach combines global and part-level losses, optimizing KL divergence to ensure robust alignment across all relevant text-skeleton pairs while capturing both sign-level semantics and detailed part dynamics. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance against existing methods on the Chinese SLR500 (reaching 97.1%) and Turkish AUTSL datasets (97.07% accuracy). The method's cross-lingual effectiveness highlight its potential for developing inclusive communication technologies.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

Despite the widespread adoption of LLMs across domains, there is still no clear consensus on how to define and operationalise trustworthiness. This study aims to bridge the gap between theoretical discussion and practical implementation by analysing research trends, definitions of trustworthiness, and practical techniques. We conducted a bibliometric mapping analysis of 2,006 publications from Web of Science (2019-2025) using the Bibliometrix, and manually reviewed 68 papers. We found a shift from traditional AI ethics discussion to LLM trustworthiness frameworks. We identified 18 different definitions of trust/trustworthiness, with transparency, explainability and reliability emerging as the most common dimensions. We identified 20 strategies to enhance LLM trustworthiness, with fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) being the most prominent. Most of the strategies are developer-driven and applied during the post-training phase. Several authors propose fragmented terminologies rather than unified frameworks, leading to the risks of "ethics washing," where ethical discourse is adopted without a genuine regulatory commitment. Our findings highlight: persistent gaps between theoretical taxonomies and practical implementation, the crucial role of the developer in operationalising trust, and call for standardised frameworks and stronger regulatory measures to enable trustworthy and ethical deployment of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Ad-hoc integrations are difficult to scale, secure, and generalize across domains. This survey examines four emerging agent communication protocols: Model Context Protocol (MCP), Agent Communication Protocol (ACP), Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A), and Agent Network Protocol (ANP), each addressing interoperability in distinct deployment contexts. MCP provides a JSON-RPC client-server interface for secure tool invocation and typed data exchange. ACP introduces REST-native messaging via multi-part messages and asynchronous streaming to support multimodal agent responses. A2A enables peer-to-peer task outsourcing through capability-based Agent Cards, facilitating enterprise-scale workflows. ANP supports open-network agent discovery and secure collaboration using decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and JSON-LD graphs. The protocols are compared across multiple dimensions, including interaction modes, discovery mechanisms, communication patterns, and security models. Based on the comparative analysis, a phased adoption roadmap is proposed: beginning with MCP for tool access, followed by ACP for multimodal messaging, A2A for collaborative task execution, and extending to ANP for decentralized agent marketplaces. This work provides a comprehensive foundation for designing secure, interoperable, and scalable ecosystems of LLM-powered agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-time Spatial Retrieval Augmented Generation for Urban Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02271v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of Generative Artificial Ingelligence (AI), especially Large Language Models, presents transformative opportunities for urban applications through Urban Foundation Models. However, base models face limitations, as they only contain the knowledge available at the time of training, and updating them is both time-consuming and costly. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged in the literature as the preferred approach for injecting contextual information into Foundation Models. It prevails over techniques such as fine-tuning, which are less effective in dynamic, real-time scenarios like those found in urban environments. However, traditional RAG architectures, based on semantic databases, knowledge graphs, structured data, or AI-powered web searches, do not fully meet the demands of urban contexts. Urban environments are complex systems characterized by large volumes of interconnected data, frequent updates, real-time processing requirements, security needs, and strong links to the physical world. This work proposes a real-time spatial RAG architecture that defines the necessary components for the effective integration of generative AI into cities, leveraging temporal and spatial filtering capabilities through linked data. The proposed architecture is implemented using FIWARE, an ecosystem of software components to develop smart city solutions and digital twins. The design and implementation are demonstrated through the use case of a tourism assistant in the city of Madrid. The use case serves to validate the correct integration of Foundation Models through the proposed RAG architecture.</p></details> |  |
| **[Personalisation or Prejudice? Addressing Geographic Bias in Hate Speech Detection using Debias Tuning in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02252v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Commercial Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently incorporated memory features to deliver personalised responses. This memory retains details such as user demographics and individual characteristics, allowing LLMs to adjust their behaviour based on personal information. However, the impact of integrating personalised information into the context has not been thoroughly assessed, leading to questions about its influence on LLM behaviour. Personalisation can be challenging, particularly with sensitive topics. In this paper, we examine various state-of-the-art LLMs to understand their behaviour in different personalisation scenarios, specifically focusing on hate speech. We prompt the models to assume country-specific personas and use different languages for hate speech detection. Our findings reveal that context personalisation significantly influences LLMs' responses in this sensitive area. To mitigate these unwanted biases, we fine-tune the LLMs by penalising inconsistent hate speech classifications made with and without country or language-specific context. The refined models demonstrate improved performance in both personalised contexts and when no context is provided.</p></details> |  |

Connecting GenAI agents via a wireless network can potentially unleash the power of Collective Intelligence (CI) and pave the way for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, current wireless networks are designed as a "data pipe" and are not suited to accommodate and leverage the power of GenAI. In this paper, we propose the GenAINet framework in which distributed GenAI agents communicate knowledge (facts, experiences, and methods) to accomplish arbitrary tasks. We first propose an architecture for a single GenAI agent and then provide a network architecture integrating GenAI capabilities to manage both network protocols and applications. Building on this, we investigate effective communication and reasoning problems by proposing a semantic-native GenAINet. Specifically, GenAI agents extract semantics from heterogeneous raw data, build and maintain a knowledge model representing the semantic relationships among pieces of knowledge, which is retrieved by GenAI models for planning and reasoning. Under this paradigm, different levels of collaboration can be achieved flexibly depending on the complexity of targeted tasks. Furthermore, we conduct two case studies in which, through wireless device queries, we demonstrate that extracting, compressing and transferring common knowledge can improve query accuracy while reducing communication costs; and in the wireless power control problem, we show that distributed agents can complete general tasks independently through collaborative reasoning without predefined communication protocols. Finally, we discuss challenges and future research directions in applying Large Language Models (LLMs) in 6G networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Study of Qwen3 Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02214v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Qwen series has emerged as a leading family of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs), demonstrating remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding tasks. With the recent release of Qwen3, which exhibits superior performance across diverse benchmarks, there is growing interest in deploying these models efficiently in resource-constrained environments. Low-bit quantization presents a promising solution, yet its impact on Qwen3's performance remains underexplored. This study conducts a systematic evaluation of Qwen3's robustness under various quantization settings, aiming to uncover both opportunities and challenges in compressing this state-of-the-art model. We rigorously assess 5 existing classic post-training quantization techniques applied to Qwen3, spanning bit-widths from 1 to 8 bits, and evaluate their effectiveness across multiple datasets. Our findings reveal that while Qwen3 maintains competitive performance at moderate bit-widths, it experiences notable degradation in linguistic tasks under ultra-low precision, underscoring the persistent hurdles in LLM compression. These results emphasize the need for further research to mitigate performance loss in extreme quantization scenarios. We anticipate that this empirical analysis will provide actionable insights for advancing quantization methods tailored to Qwen3 and future LLMs, ultimately enhancing their practicality without compromising accuracy. Our project is released on https://github.com/Efficient-ML/Qwen3-Quantization and https://huggingface.co/collections/Efficient-ML/qwen3-quantization-68164450decb1c868788cb2b.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose LASSI-EE, an automated LLM-based refactoring framework that generates energy-efficient parallel code on a target parallel system for a given parallel code as input. Through a multi-stage, iterative pipeline process, LASSI-EE achieved an average energy reduction of 47% across 85% of the 20 HeCBench benchmarks tested on NVIDIA A100 GPUs. Our findings demonstrate the broader potential of LLMs, not only for generating correct code but also for enabling energy-aware programming. We also address key insights and limitations within the framework, offering valuable guidance for future improvements.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

However, evaluation benchmarks designed for Hong Kong's unique linguistic landscape, which combines Traditional Chinese script with Cantonese as the spoken form and its cultural context, remain underdeveloped. To address this gap, we introduce HKMMLU, a multi-task language understanding benchmark that evaluates Hong Kong's linguistic competence and socio-cultural knowledge. The HKMMLU includes 26,698 multi-choice questions across 66 subjects, organized into four categories: Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM), Social Sciences, Humanities, and Other. To evaluate the multilingual understanding ability of LLMs, 90,550 Mandarin-Cantonese translation tasks were additionally included. We conduct comprehensive experiments on GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and 18 open-source LLMs of varying sizes on HKMMLU. The results show that the best-performing model, DeepSeek-V3, struggles to achieve an accuracy of 75\%, significantly lower than that of MMLU and CMMLU. This performance gap highlights the need to improve LLMs' capabilities in Hong Kong-specific language and knowledge domains. Furthermore, we investigate how question language, model size, prompting strategies, and question and reasoning token lengths affect model performance. We anticipate that HKMMLU will significantly advance the development of LLMs in multilingual and cross-cultural contexts, thereby enabling broader and more impactful applications.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we present a suite of experiments to assess the performance of modern LLMs (ranging from 3B to 90B+ parameters) on CaseHOLD, a legal benchmark dataset for identifying case holdings. Our experiments demonstrate ``scaling effects'' - performance on this task improves with model size, with more capable models like GPT4o and AmazonNovaPro achieving macro F1 scores of 0.744 and 0.720 respectively. These scores are competitive with the best published results on this dataset, and do not require any technically sophisticated model training, fine-tuning or few-shot prompting. To ensure that these strong results are not due to memorization of judicial opinions contained in the training data, we develop and utilize a novel citation anonymization test that preserves semantic meaning while ensuring case names and citations are fictitious. Models maintain strong performance under these conditions (macro F1 of 0.728), suggesting the performance is not due to rote memorization. These findings demonstrate both the promise and current limitations of LLMs for legal tasks with important implications for the development and measurement of automated legal analytics and legal benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented as a short paper at International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law 2025 (Chicago, IL)</p></details> |

Despite evidence that Large Language Models (LLMs) are sensitive to the layout and structure of retrieved data, there is currently no framework to analyze the impact of different chunking methods. In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology that defines essential characteristics of the chunking process at three levels: intrinsic passage properties, extrinsic passage properties, and passages-document coherence. We propose HOPE (Holistic Passage Evaluation), a domain-agnostic, automatic evaluation metric that quantifies and aggregates these characteristics. Our empirical evaluations across seven domains demonstrate that the HOPE metric correlates significantly (p > 0.13) with various RAG performance indicators, revealing contrasts between the importance of extrinsic and intrinsic properties of passages. Semantic independence between passages proves essential for system performance with a performance gain of up to 56.2% in factual correctness and 21.1% in answer correctness. On the contrary, traditional assumptions about maintaining concept unity within passages show minimal impact. These findings provide actionable insights for optimizing chunking strategies, thus improving RAG system design to produce more factually correct responses.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, To be published in SIGIR25</p></details> |

We analyze occupational exposure to LLM capabilities by incorporating human expertise and LLM classifications, following the methodology of Eloundou et al. (2023). The results indicate a positive correlation between occupational exposure and both wage levels and experience premiums at the occupation level. This suggests that higher-paying and experience-intensive jobs may face greater exposure risks from LLM-powered software. We then aggregate occupational exposure at the industry level to obtain industrial exposure scores. Both occupational and industrial exposure scores align with expert assessments. Our empirical analysis also demonstrates a distinct impact of LLMs, which deviates from the routinization hypothesis. We present a stylized theoretical framework to better understand this deviation from previous digital technologies. By incorporating entropy-based information theory into the task-based framework, we propose an AI learning theory that reveals a different pattern of LLM impacts compared to the routinization hypothesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is published in China Economic Review, Volume 92 (2025), 102413, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chieco.2025.102413</p></details> |

However, frequent testing can be burdensome for patients, and test results may not always be immediately available. To address these challenges, we propose LabTOP, a unified model that predicts lab test outcomes by leveraging a language modeling approach on EHR data. Unlike conventional methods that estimate only a subset of lab tests or classify discrete value ranges, LabTOP performs continuous numerical predictions for a diverse range of lab items. We evaluate LabTOP on three publicly available EHR datasets and demonstrate that it outperforms existing methods, including traditional machine learning models and state-of-the-art large language models. We also conduct extensive ablation studies to confirm the effectiveness of our design choices. We believe that LabTOP will serve as an accurate and generalizable framework for lab test outcome prediction, with potential applications in clinical decision support and early detection of critical conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages for main text, 13 pages for appendix</p></details> |

Recent studies demonstrate that TTS can further elicit the problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling significant breakthroughs not only in specialized reasoning tasks, such as mathematics and coding, but also in general tasks like open-ended Q&A. However, despite the explosion of recent efforts in this area, there remains an urgent need for a comprehensive survey offering a systemic understanding. To fill this gap, we propose a unified, multidimensional framework structured along four core dimensions of TTS research: what to scale, how to scale, where to scale, and how well to scale. Building upon this taxonomy, we conduct an extensive review of methods, application scenarios, and assessment aspects, and present an organized decomposition that highlights the unique functional roles of individual techniques within the broader TTS landscape. From this analysis, we distill the major developmental trajectories of TTS to date and offer hands-on guidelines for practical deployment. Furthermore, we identify several open challenges and offer insights into promising future directions, including further scaling, clarifying the functional essence of techniques, generalizing to more tasks, and more attributions.

They are increasingly used in problem-solving tasks to substitute human assessment and reasoning. LLMs are trained on what humans write and thus prone to learn human biases. One of the most widespread human biases is overconfidence. We examine whether LLMs inherit this bias. We automatically construct reasoning problems with known ground truths, and prompt LLMs to assess the confidence in their answers, closely following similar protocols in human experiments. We find that all five LLMs we study are overconfident: they overestimate the probability that their answer is correct between 20% and 60%. Humans have accuracy similar to the more advanced LLMs, but far lower overconfidence. Although humans and LLMs are similarly biased in questions which they are certain they answered correctly, a key difference emerges between them: LLM bias increases sharply relative to humans if they become less sure that their answers are correct. We also show that LLM input has ambiguous effects on human decision making: LLM input leads to an increase in the accuracy, but it more than doubles the extent of overconfidence in the answers.</p></details> |  |

An attractive solution to relieve the programming burden is to transcompile the legacy code of one platform to others. However, current transcompilation techniques struggle with either tremendous manual efforts or functional incorrectness, rendering "Write Once, Run Anywhere" of tensor programs an open question. We propose a novel transcompiler, i.e., QiMeng-Xpiler, for automatically translating tensor programs across DLS via both large language models (LLMs) and symbolic program synthesis, i.e., neural-symbolic synthesis. The key insight is leveraging the powerful code generation ability of LLM to make costly search-based symbolic synthesis computationally tractable. Concretely, we propose multiple LLM-assisted compilation passes via pre-defined meta-prompts for program transformation. During each program transformation, efficient symbolic program synthesis is employed to repair incorrect code snippets with a limited scale. To attain high performance, we propose a hierarchical auto-tuning approach to systematically explore both the parameters and sequences of transformation passes. Experiments on 4 DLS with distinct programming interfaces, i.e., Intel DL Boost with VNNI, NVIDIA GPU with CUDA, AMD MI with HIP, and Cambricon MLU with BANG, demonstrate that QiMeng-Xpiler correctly translates different tensor programs at the accuracy of 95% on average, and the performance of translated programs achieves up to 2.0x over vendor-provided manually-optimized libraries. As a result, the programming productivity of DLS is improved by up to 96.0x via transcompiling legacy tensor programs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to OSDI 2025</p></details> |

In contrast, simpler and more economical Offline RL methods remain underexplored. To address this gap, we investigate the effectiveness of Offline RL methods, specifically Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its length-desensitized variant LD-DPO, in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that these simpler Offline RL methods substantially improve model performance, achieving an average enhancement of 3.3\%, with a particularly notable increase of 10.1\% on the challenging Arena-Hard benchmark. Furthermore, we analyze DPO's sensitivity to output length, emphasizing that increasing reasoning length should align with semantic richness, as indiscriminate lengthening may adversely affect model performance. We provide comprehensive descriptions of our data processing and training methodologies, offering empirical evidence and practical insights for developing more cost-effective Offline RL approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Multivariate Time Series Forecasting via Calibrated Language Models with Privileged Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02138v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) endeavors to predict future observations given historical data, playing a crucial role in time series data management systems. With advancements in large language models (LLMs), recent studies employ textual prompt tuning to infuse the knowledge of LLMs into MTSF. However, the deployment of LLMs often suffers from low efficiency during the inference phase. To address this problem, we introduce TimeKD, an efficient MTSF framework that leverages the calibrated language models and privileged knowledge distillation. TimeKD aims to generate high-quality future representations from the proposed cross-modality teacher model and cultivate an effective student model. The cross-modality teacher model adopts calibrated language models (CLMs) with ground truth prompts, motivated by the paradigm of Learning Under Privileged Information (LUPI). In addition, we design a subtractive cross attention (SCA) mechanism to refine these representations. To cultivate an effective student model, we propose an innovative privileged knowledge distillation (PKD) mechanism including correlation and feature distillation. PKD enables the student to replicate the teacher's behavior while minimizing their output discrepancy. Extensive experiments on real data offer insight into the effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability of the proposed TimeKD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDE 2025</p></details> |

As these pretrained models continue to evolve, their ability to understand and generate complex code structures has opened new possibilities for automating intricate programming tasks for the sake of accurate code generation. Although contemporary foundational models demonstrate promoting results, researchers continue to explore optimal post-training strategies to enhance code quality. These include supervised fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), debugging, and many others. In this paper, we combine two widely used approaches namely multi-agent collaboration and runtime execution information-based debugging, for improving code generation functionality, reliability, and practical applicability. We perform an empirical study in order to extend the evaluation of the individual strategies as well as the proposed composition of the activities of both strategies. Our study use 19 LLMs to examines the performance of individual and the proposed strategies, offering comprehensive insights into how different programming activities compositions and training paradigms influence code generation effectiveness. In particular, we implement a chained system that combines both strategies to assess their combined impact on functional accuracy, code reliability, and generation latency using two benchmark datasets commonly used for code generation. Our findings provide valuable insights for organizations seeking robust AI-driven coding solutions by guiding them in selecting models that can better adapt to complex post-training strategies, ultimately fostering the adoption of more effective and reliable code generation technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attention Mechanisms Perspective: Exploring LLM Processing of Graph-Structured Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02130v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention mechanisms are critical to the success of large language models (LLMs), driving significant advancements in multiple fields. However, for graph-structured data, which requires emphasis on topological connections, they fall short compared to message-passing mechanisms on fixed links, such as those employed by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). This raises a question: ``Does attention fail for graphs in natural language settings?'' Motivated by these observations, we embarked on an empirical study from the perspective of attention mechanisms to explore how LLMs process graph-structured data. The goal is to gain deeper insights into the attention behavior of LLMs over graph structures. We uncovered unique phenomena regarding how LLMs apply attention to graph-structured data and analyzed these findings to improve the modeling of such data by LLMs. The primary findings of our research are: 1) While LLMs can recognize graph data and capture text-node interactions, they struggle to model inter-node relationships within graph structures due to inherent architectural constraints. 2) The attention distribution of LLMs across graph nodes does not align with ideal structural patterns, indicating a failure to adapt to graph topology nuances. 3) Neither fully connected attention nor fixed connectivity is optimal; each has specific limitations in its application scenarios. Instead, intermediate-state attention windows improve LLM training performance and seamlessly transition to fully connected windows during inference.

However, complex tasks requiring multi-round retrieval remain challenging, and early attempts tend to be overly optimistic without a good sense of self-skepticism. Current multi-round RAG systems may continue searching even when enough information has already been retrieved, or they may provide incorrect answers without having sufficient information or knowledge. Existing solutions either require large amounts of expensive human-labeled process supervision data or lead to subpar performance. This paper aims to address these limitations by introducing a new framework, \textbf{SIM-RAG}, to explicitly enhance RAG systems' self-awareness and multi-round retrieval capabilities. To train SIM-RAG, we first let a RAG system self-practice multi-round retrieval, augmenting existing question-answer pairs with intermediate inner monologue reasoning steps to generate synthetic training data. For each pair, the system may explore multiple retrieval paths, which are labeled as successful if they reach the correct answer and unsuccessful otherwise. Using this data, we train a lightweight information sufficiency Critic. At inference time, the Critic evaluates whether the RAG system has retrieved sufficient information at each round, guiding retrieval decisions and improving system-level self-awareness through in-context reinforcement learning. Experiments across multiple prominent RAG benchmarks show that SIM-RAG is an effective multi-round RAG solution. Furthermore, this framework is system-efficient, adding a lightweight component to RAG without requiring modifications to existing LLMs or search engines, and data-efficient, eliminating the need for costly human-annotated mid-step retrieval process supervision data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 48th International ACM SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

This paper presents an automated radiology report generation framework that combines Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) with a Multi-Agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to bridge AI performance with clinical explainability. CBMs map chest X-ray features to human-understandable clinical concepts, enabling transparent disease classification. Meanwhile, the RAG system integrates multi-agent collaboration and external knowledge to produce contextually rich, evidence-based reports. Our demonstration showcases the system's ability to deliver interpretable predictions, mitigate hallucinations, and generate high-quality, tailored reports with an interactive interface addressing accuracy, trust, and usability challenges.

This results in non-uniform cluster access patterns in disk-based vector search systems, particularly in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. While existing approaches optimize individual queries, they overlook the impact of cluster access patterns, failing to account for the locality effects of queries that access similar clusters. This oversight reduces cache efficiency and increases search latency due to excessive disk I/O. To address this, we introduce CaGR-RAG, a context-aware query grouping mechanism that organizes queries based on shared cluster access patterns. Additionally, it incorporates opportunistic cluster prefetching to minimize cache misses during transitions between query groups, further optimizing retrieval performance. Experimental results show that CaGR-RAG reduces 99th percentile tail latency by up to 51.55% while consistently maintaining a higher cache hit ratio than the baseline.</p></details> |  |

A Survey of Methods and Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20119v2)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has advanced significantly in recent years. The complexity of RAG systems, which involve multiple components-such as indexing, retrieval, and generation-along with numerous other parameters, poses substantial challenges for systematic evaluation and quality enhancement. Previous research highlights that evaluating RAG systems is essential for documenting advancements, comparing configurations, and identifying effective approaches for domain-specific applications. This study systematically reviews 63 academic articles to provide a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art RAG evaluation methodologies, focusing on four key areas: datasets, retrievers, indexing and databases, and the generator component. We observe the feasibility of an automated evaluation approach for each component of a RAG system, leveraging an LLM capable of both generating evaluation datasets and conducting evaluations. In addition, we found that further practical research is essential to provide companies with clear guidance on the do's and don'ts of implementing and evaluating RAG systems. By synthesizing evaluation approaches for key RAG components and emphasizing the creation and adaptation of domain-specific datasets for benchmarking, we contribute to the advancement of systematic evaluation methods and the improvement of evaluation rigor for RAG systems. Furthermore, by examining the interplay between automated approaches leveraging LLMs and human judgment, we contribute to the ongoing discourse on balancing automation and human input, clarifying their respective contributions, limitations, and challenges in achieving robust and reliable evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 Pag...</summary><p>8 Pages.

A clear separation of private information from the LLM training has made RAG the basis for many enterprise LLM workloads as it allows the company to augment LLM's understanding using customers' private documents. Despite its popularity for private documents in enterprise deployments, current RAG benchmarks for validating and optimizing RAG pipelines draw their corpora from public data such as Wikipedia or generic web pages and offer little to no personal context. Seeking to empower more personal and private RAG we release the EnronQA benchmark, a dataset of 103,638 emails with 528,304 question-answer pairs across 150 different user inboxes. EnronQA enables better benchmarking of RAG pipelines over private data and allows for experimentation on the introduction of personalized retrieval settings over realistic data. Finally, we use EnronQA to explore the tradeoff in memorization and retrieval when reasoning over private documents.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[SAGE: A Framework of Precise Retrieval for RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01713v2)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated significant proficiency in conducting question-answering (QA) tasks within a specified corpus. Nonetheless, numerous failure instances of RAG in QA still exist. These failures are not solely attributable to the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs); instead, they predominantly arise from the retrieval of inaccurate information for LLMs due to two limitations: (1) Current RAG methods segment the corpus without considering semantics, making it difficult to find relevant context due to impaired correlation between questions and the segments. (2) There is a trade-off between missing essential context with fewer context retrieved and getting irrelevant context with more context retrieved. In this paper, we introduce a RAG framework (SAGE), to overcome these limitations. First, to address the segmentation issue without considering semantics, we propose to train a semantic segmentation model. This model is trained to segment the corpus into semantically complete chunks. Second, to ensure that only the most relevant chunks are retrieved while the irrelevant ones are ignored, we design a chunk selection algorithm to dynamically select chunks based on the decreasing speed of the relevance score, leading to a more relevant selection. Third, to further ensure the precision of the retrieved chunks, we propose letting LLMs assess whether retrieved chunks are excessive or lacking and then adjust the amount of context accordingly. Experiments show that SAGE outperforms baselines by 61.25% in the quality of QA on average. Moreover, by avoiding retrieving noisy context, SAGE lowers the cost of the tokens consumed in LLM inference and achieves a 49.41% enhancement in cost efficiency on average. Additionally, our work offers valuable insights for boosting RAG.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) provides a promising post-training solution by leveraging external knowledge. However, existing medical RAG systems suffer from two key limitations: (1) a lack of modeling for human-like reasoning behaviors during information retrieval, and (2) reliance on suboptimal medical corpora, which often results in the retrieval of irrelevant or noisy snippets. To overcome these challenges, we propose Discuss-RAG, a plug-and-play module designed to enhance the medical QA RAG system through collaborative agent-based reasoning. Our method introduces a summarizer agent that orchestrates a team of medical experts to emulate multi-turn brainstorming, thereby improving the relevance of retrieved content. Additionally, a decision-making agent evaluates the retrieved snippets before their final integration. Experimental results on four benchmark medical QA datasets show that Discuss-RAG consistently outperforms MedRAG, especially significantly improving answer accuracy by up to 16.67% on BioASQ and 12.20% on PubMedQA.

Within financial sectors, modern enterprises increasingly rely on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to address complex compliance requirements in financial document workflows. However, existing solutions struggle to account for the inherent heterogeneity of data (e.g., text, tables, diagrams) and evolving nature of regulatory standards used in financial filings, leading to compromised accuracy in critical information extraction. We propose the FinSage framework as a solution, utilizing a multi-aspect RAG framework tailored for regulatory compliance analysis in multi-modal financial documents. FinSage introduces three innovative components: (1) a multi-modal pre-processing pipeline that unifies diverse data formats and generates chunk-level metadata summaries, (2) a multi-path sparse-dense retrieval system augmented with query expansion (HyDE) and metadata-aware semantic search, and (3) a domain-specialized re-ranking module fine-tuned via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to prioritize compliance-critical content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FinSage achieves an impressive recall of 92.51% on 75 expert-curated questions derived from surpasses the best baseline method on the FinanceBench question answering datasets by 24.06% in accuracy. Moreover, FinSage has been successfully deployed as financial question-answering agent in online meetings, where it has already served more than 1,200 people.</p></details> |  |

By combining structured knowledge graphs with contextually enriched text segments, Graph RAG offers a promising solution to address the inherent complexity and vast volume of legal data. The integration of hierarchical structure and temporal evolution into knowledge graphs - along with the concept of comprehensive Text Units - facilitates the construction of richer, interconnected representations of legal knowledge. Through a detailed analysis of Graph RAG and its application to legal norm datasets, this article aims to significantly advance the field of Artificial Intelligence applied to Law, creating opportunities for more effective systems in legal research, legislative analysis, and decision support.</p></details> |  |

Traditional RAG enhancements have explored vertical scaling-assigning subtasks to specialized modules-and horizontal scaling-replicating tasks across multiple agents-to improve performance. However, real-world applications impose diverse Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, involving trade-offs among objectives such as reducing cost, ensuring answer quality, and adhering to specific operational constraints. In this work, we present a systems-oriented approach to multi-agent RAG tailored for real-world Question Answering (QA) applications. By integrating task-specific non-functional requirements-such as answer quality, cost, and latency-into the system, we enable dynamic reconfiguration to meet diverse SLAs. Our method maps these Service Level Objectives (SLOs) to system-level parameters, allowing the generation of optimal results within specified resource constraints. We conduct a case study in the QA domain, demonstrating how dynamic re-orchestration of a multi-agent RAG system can effectively manage the trade-off between answer quality and cost. By adjusting the system based on query intent and operational conditions, we systematically balance performance and resource utilization. This approach allows the system to meet SLOs for various query types, showcasing its practicality for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

It proposes a state-aware dynamic knowledge retrieval mechanism to enhance semantic understanding and knowledge scheduling efficiency in large language models for open-domain question answering and complex generation tasks. The method introduces a multi-level perceptive retrieval vector construction strategy and a differentiable document matching path. These components enable end-to-end joint training and collaborative optimization of the retrieval and generation modules. This effectively addresses the limitations of static RAG structures in context adaptation and knowledge access. Experiments are conducted on the Natural Questions dataset. The proposed structure is thoroughly evaluated across different large models, including GPT-4, GPT-4o, and DeepSeek. Comparative and ablation experiments from multiple perspectives confirm the significant improvements in BLEU and ROUGE-L scores. The approach also demonstrates stronger robustness and generation consistency in tasks involving semantic ambiguity and multi-document fusion. These results highlight its broad application potential and practical value in building high-quality language generation systems.</p></details> |  |

As a result, recent efforts focus on instruction-tuning open-source LLMs, though the potential of combining them with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we are the first to explore a knowledge graph-based (KG) RAG framework for Japanese medical QA small-scale open-source LLMs. Experimental results show that KG-based RAG has only a limited impact on Japanese medical QA using small-scale open-source LLMs. Further case studies reveal that the effectiveness of the RAG is sensitive to the quality and relevance of the external retrieved content. These findings offer valuable insights into the challenges and potential of applying RAG in Japanese medical QA, while also serving as a reference for other low-resource languages.</p></details> | 10 pages |

To address this limitation, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance LLMs by retrieving relevant information from external sources, thereby positioning the retriever as a pivotal component. Although dense retrieval demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, its training poses challenges due to the scarcity of ground-truth evidence, largely attributed to the high costs of human annotation. In this paper, we propose W-RAG, a method that draws weak training signals from the downstream task (such as OpenQA) of an LLM, and fine-tunes the retriever to prioritize passages that most benefit the task. Specifically, we rerank the top-$k$ passages retrieved via BM25 by assessing the probability that the LLM will generate the correct answer for a question given each passage. The highest-ranking passages are then used as positive fine-tuning examples for dense retrieval. We conduct comprehensive experiments across four publicly available OpenQA datasets to demonstrate that our approach enhances both retrieval and OpenQA performance compared to baseline models, achieving results comparable to models fine-tuned with human-labeled data.</p></details> |  |

They provide native support for citation and grounding with literal quotes and reintegrate multiple features associated with RAG workflows, such as query routing, query reformulation, and source reranking. Pleias-RAG-350m and Pleias-RAG-1B outperform SLMs below 4 billion parameters on standardized RAG benchmarks (HotPotQA, 2wiki) and are competitive with popular larger models, including Qwen-2.5-7B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Gemma-3-4B. They are the only SLMs to date maintaining consistent RAG performance across leading European languages and ensuring systematic reference grounding for statements. Due to their size and ease of deployment on constrained infrastructure and higher factuality by design, the models unlock a range of new use cases for generative AI.</p></details> |  |

However, despite the widespread use of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, AI safety work focuses on standard LLMs, which means we know little about how RAG use cases change a model's safety profile. We conduct a detailed comparative analysis of RAG and non-RAG frameworks with eleven LLMs. We find that RAG can make models less safe and change their safety profile. We explore the causes of this change and find that even combinations of safe models with safe documents can cause unsafe generations. In addition, we evaluate some existing red teaming methods for RAG settings and show that they are less effective than when used for non-RAG settings. Our work highlights the need for safety research and red-teaming methods specifically tailored for RAG LLMs.</p></details> | NAACL 2025 |

While many studies focus on evaluating the overall quality of end-to-end RAG systems, there is a gap in understanding the appropriateness of LLMs for the RAG task. To address this, we introduce Trust-Score, a holistic metric that evaluates the trustworthiness of LLMs within the RAG framework. Our results show that various prompting methods, such as in-context learning, fail to effectively adapt LLMs to the RAG task as measured by Trust-Score. Consequently, we propose Trust-Align, a method to align LLMs for improved Trust-Score performance. 26 out of 27 models aligned using Trust-Align substantially outperform competitive baselines on ASQA, QAMPARI, and ELI5. Specifically, in LLaMA-3-8b, Trust-Align outperforms FRONT on ASQA (up 12.56), QAMPARI (up 36.04), and ELI5 (up 17.69). Trust-Align also significantly enhances models' ability to correctly refuse and provide quality citations. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of Trust-Align across different open-weight models, including the LLaMA series (1b to 8b), Qwen-2.5 series (0.5b to 7b), and Phi3.5 (3.8b).

Additionally, we critically evaluate current limitations in RAG assessment, including the absence of intermediate supervision for multi-step reasoning and practical challenges related to cost-risk trade-offs. To bridge theory and practice, we provide practical guidelines tailored to diverse real-world applications. Finally, we identify promising research directions, such as graph-based knowledge integration, hybrid model collaboration, and RL-driven optimization. Overall, this work presents a theoretical framework and practical foundation to advance RAG systems in academia and industry, fostering the next generation of RAG solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A RAG-Based Multi-Agent LLM System for Natural Hazard Resilience and Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17200v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are a transformational capability at the frontier of artificial intelligence and machine learning that can support decision-makers in addressing pressing societal challenges such as extreme natural hazard events. As generalized models, LLMs often struggle to provide context-specific information, particularly in areas requiring specialized knowledge. In this work we propose a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based multi-agent LLM system to support analysis and decision-making in the context of natural hazards and extreme weather events. As a proof of concept, we present WildfireGPT, a specialized system focused on wildfire hazards. The architecture employs a user-centered, multi-agent design to deliver tailored risk insights across diverse stakeholder groups. By integrating natural hazard and extreme weather projection data, observational datasets, and scientific literature through an RAG framework, the system ensures both the accuracy and contextual relevance of the information it provides. Evaluation across ten expert-led case studies demonstrates that WildfireGPT significantly outperforms existing LLM-based solutions for decision support.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Critical Thinking with AI: A Tailored Warning System for RAG Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16883v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems offer a powerful approach to enhancing large language model (LLM) outputs by incorporating fact-checked, contextually relevant information. However, fairness and reliability concerns persist, as hallucinations can emerge at both the retrieval and generation stages, affecting users' reasoning and decision-making. Our research explores how tailored warning messages -- whose content depends on the specific context of hallucination -- shape user reasoning and actions in an educational quiz setting. Preliminary findings suggest that while warnings improve accuracy and awareness of high-level hallucinations, they may also introduce cognitive friction, leading to confusion and diminished trust in the system. By examining these interactions, this work contributes to the broader goal of AI-augmented reasoning: developing systems that actively support human reflection, critical thinking, and informed decision-making rather than passive information consumption.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 2025 ACM Workshop on Human-AI Interaction for Augmented Reasoning</p></details> |

However, IFC data can be very complicated because it allows for multiple ways to represent the same product information. In this research, we utilise the capabilities of LLMs to parse the IFC data with Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph-RAG) technique to retrieve building object properties and their relations. We will show that, despite limitations due to the complex hierarchy of the IFC data, the Graph-RAG parsing enhances generative LLMs like GPT-4o with graph-based knowledge, enabling natural language query-response retrieval without the need for a complex pipeline.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 European Conference on Computing in Construction</p></details> |
| **[Credible plan-driven RAG method for Multi-hop Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16787v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-hop question answering (QA) presents a considerable challenge for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), requiring the structured decomposition of complex queries into logical reasoning paths and the generation of dependable intermediate results. However, deviations in reasoning paths or errors in intermediate results, which are common in current RAG methods, may propagate and accumulate throughout the reasoning process, diminishing the accuracy of the answer to complex queries. To address this challenge, we propose the Plan-then-Act-and-Review (PAR RAG) framework, which is organized into three key stages: planning, act, and review, and aims to offer an interpretable and incremental reasoning paradigm for accurate and reliable multi-hop question answering by mitigating error propagation.PAR RAG initially applies a top-down problem decomposition strategy, formulating a comprehensive plan that integrates multiple executable steps from a holistic viewpoint. This approach avoids the pitfalls of local optima common in traditional RAG methods, ensuring the accuracy of the entire reasoning path. Subsequently, PAR RAG incorporates a plan execution mechanism based on multi-granularity verification. By utilizing both coarse-grained similarity information and fine-grained relevant data, the framework thoroughly checks and adjusts intermediate results, ensuring process accuracy while effectively managing error propagation and amplification. Experimental results on multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that the PAR RAG framework substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in key metrics, including EM and F1 scores.</p></details> | 18 pages, 3 figures |

Existing methods, which operate at the document level, fail to effectively filter out such content. We propose LLM-driven chunk filtering, ChunkRAG, a framework that enhances RAG systems by evaluating and filtering retrieved information at the chunk level. Our approach employs semantic chunking to divide documents into coherent sections and utilizes LLM-based relevance scoring to assess each chunk's alignment with the user's query. By filtering out less pertinent chunks before the generation phase, we significantly reduce hallucinations and improve factual accuracy. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing RAG models, achieving higher accuracy on tasks requiring precise information retrieval. This advancement enhances the reliability of RAG systems, making them particularly beneficial for applications like fact-checking and multi-hop reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, Student Research Workshop 2025 (NAACL SRW 2025)</p></details> |

To answer this question, we investigate the efficacy of crowdsourcing for RAG through two complementary studies: response writing and response utility judgment. We present the Crowd RAG Corpus 2025 (CrowdRAG-25), which consists of 903 human-written and 903 LLM-generated responses for the 301 topics of the TREC RAG'24 track, across the three discourse styles 'bulleted list', 'essay', and 'news'. For a selection of 65 topics, the corpus further contains 47,320 pairwise human judgments and 10,556 pairwise LLM judgments across seven utility dimensions (e.g., coverage and coherence). Our analyses give insights into human writing behavior for RAG and the viability of crowdsourcing for RAG evaluation. Human pairwise judgments provide reliable and cost-effective results compared to LLM-based pairwise or human/LLM-based pointwise judgments, as well as automated comparisons with human-written reference responses. All our data and tools are freely available.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 tables, 5 figures. Accepted at SIGIR'25</p></details> |
| **[CiteFix: Enhancing RAG Accuracy Through Post-Processing Citation Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15629v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful application of Large Language Models (LLMs), revolutionizing information search and consumption. RAG systems combine traditional search capabilities with LLMs to generate comprehensive answers to user queries, ideally with accurate citations. However, in our experience of developing a RAG product, LLMs often struggle with source attribution, aligning with other industry studies reporting citation accuracy rates of only about 74% for popular generative search engines. To address this, we present efficient post-processing algorithms to improve citation accuracy in LLM-generated responses, with minimal impact on latency and cost. Our approaches cross-check generated citations against retrieved articles using methods including keyword + semantic matching, fine tuned model with BERTScore, and a lightweight LLM-based technique. Our experimental results demonstrate a relative improvement of 15.46% in the overall accuracy metrics of our RAG system. This significant enhancement potentially enables a shift from our current larger language model to a relatively smaller model that is approximately 12x more cost-effective and 3x faster in inference time, while maintaining comparable performance. This research contributes to enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of AI-generated content in information retrieval and summarization tasks which is critical to gain customer trust especially in commercial products.</p></details> |  |

A crucial factor in RAG evaluation is "support", whether the information in the cited documents supports the answer. To this end, we conducted a large-scale comparative study of 45 participant submissions on 36 topics to the TREC 2024 RAG Track, comparing an automatic LLM judge (GPT-4o) against human judges for support assessment. We considered two conditions: (1) fully manual assessments from scratch and (2) manual assessments with post-editing of LLM predictions. Our results indicate that for 56% of the manual from-scratch assessments, human and GPT-4o predictions match perfectly (on a three-level scale), increasing to 72% in the manual with post-editing condition. Furthermore, by carefully analyzing the disagreements in an unbiased study, we found that an independent human judge correlates better with GPT-4o than a human judge, suggesting that LLM judges can be a reliable alternative for support assessment. To conclude, we provide a qualitative analysis of human and GPT-4o errors to help guide future iterations of support assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGIR 2025 (short)</p></details> |
| **[The Great Nugget Recall: Automating Fact Extraction and RAG Evaluation with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15068v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced the capabilities of information access systems, especially with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Nevertheless, the evaluation of RAG systems remains a barrier to continued progress, a challenge we tackle in this work by proposing an automatic evaluation framework that is validated against human annotations. We believe that the nugget evaluation methodology provides a solid foundation for evaluating RAG systems. This approach, originally developed for the TREC Question Answering (QA) Track in 2003, evaluates systems based on atomic facts that should be present in good answers. Our efforts focus on "refactoring" this methodology, where we describe the AutoNuggetizer framework that specifically applies LLMs to both automatically create nuggets and automatically assign nuggets to system answers. In the context of the TREC 2024 RAG Track, we calibrate a fully automatic approach against strategies where nuggets are created manually or semi-manually by human assessors and then assigned manually to system answers. Based on results from a community-wide evaluation, we observe strong agreement at the run level between scores derived from fully automatic nugget evaluation and human-based variants. The agreement is stronger when individual framework components such as nugget assignment are automated independently. This suggests that our evaluation framework provides tradeoffs between effort and quality that can be used to guide the development of future RAG systems. However, further research is necessary to refine our approach, particularly in establishing robust per-topic agreement to diagnose system failures effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in SIGIR 2025.

| **[AlignRAG: An Adaptable Framework for Resolving Misalignments in Retrieval-Aware Reasoning of RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14858v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a foundational paradigm for knowledge-grounded text generation. However, existing RAG pipelines often fail to ensure that the reasoning trajectories align with the evidential constraints imposed by retrieved content. In this paper, we reframe RAG as a problem of retrieval-aware reasoning and identify a core challenge: reasoning misalignment-the mismatch between a model's reasoning trajectory and the retrieved evidence. To address this challenge, we propose AlignRAG, a novel test-time framework that mitigates reasoning misalignment through iterative Critique-Driven Alignment (CDA) steps. In contrast to prior approaches that rely on static training or post-hoc selection, AlignRAG actively refines reasoning trajectories during inference by enforcing fine-grained alignment with evidence. Our framework introduces a new paradigm for retrieval-aware reasoning by: (1) constructing context-rich training corpora; (2) generating contrastive critiques from preference-aware reasoning trajectories; (3) training a dedicated \textit{Critic Language Model (CLM)} to identify reasoning misalignments; and (4) applying CDA steps to optimize reasoning trajectories iteratively. Empirical results demonstrate that AlignRAG consistently outperforms all baselines and could integrate as a plug-and-play module into existing RAG pipelines without further changes. By reconceptualizing RAG as a structured reasoning trajectory and establishing the test-time framework for correcting reasoning misalignments in RAG, AlignRAG provides practical advancements for retrieval-aware generation.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we develop an efficient bilingual question-answering framework for regulatory documents, specifically the Bangladesh Police Gazettes, which contain both English and Bangla text. Our approach employs modern Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines to enhance information retrieval and response generation. In addition to conventional RAG pipelines, we propose an advanced RAG-based approach that improves retrieval performance, leading to more precise answers. This system enables efficient searching for specific government legal notices, making legal information more accessible. We evaluate both our proposed and conventional RAG systems on a diverse test set on Bangladesh Police Gazettes, demonstrating that our approach consistently outperforms existing methods across all evaluation metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IJCNN 2025</p></details> |

Unlike traditional vulnerabilities, these packages are intentionally designed to deceive users, making detection challenging due to evolving attack methods and the lack of structured datasets. In this work, we empirically evaluate the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and few-shot learning for detecting malicious source code. We fine-tune LLMs on curated datasets and integrate YARA rules, GitHub Security Advisories, and malicious code snippets with the aim of enhancing classification accuracy. We came across a counterintuitive outcome: While RAG is expected to boost up the prediction performance, it fails in the performed evaluation, obtaining a mediocre accuracy. In contrast, few-shot learning is more effective as it significantly improves the detection of malicious code, achieving 97% accuracy and 95% balanced accuracy, outperforming traditional RAG approaches. Thus, future work should expand structured knowledge bases, refine retrieval models, and explore hybrid AI-driven cybersecurity solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been peer-reviewed and accepted for publication to the 29th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE 2025)</p></details> |
| **[RAG Without the Lag: Interactive Debugging for Retrieval-Augmented Generation Pipelines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13587v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines have become the de-facto approach for building AI assistants with access to external, domain-specific knowledge. Given a user query, RAG pipelines typically first retrieve (R) relevant information from external sources, before invoking a Large Language Model (LLM), augmented (A) with this information, to generate (G) responses. Modern RAG pipelines frequently chain multiple retrieval and generation components, in any order. However, developing effective RAG pipelines is challenging because retrieval and generation components are intertwined, making it hard to identify which component(s) cause errors in the eventual output. The parameters with the greatest impact on output quality often require hours of pre-processing after each change, creating prohibitively slow feedback cycles. To address these challenges, we present RAGGY, a developer tool that combines a Python library of composable RAG primitives with an interactive interface for real-time debugging. We contribute the design and implementation of RAGGY, insights into expert debugging patterns through a qualitative study with 12 engineers, and design implications for future RAG tools that better align with developers' natural workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

When relevant internal documents are unavailable, the system struggles to generate accurate and complete responses. Additionally, using closed-source Large Language Models (LLMs) raises concerns about exposing proprietary information. To address these issues, we propose the Secure Multifaceted-RAG (SecMulti-RAG) framework, which retrieves not only from internal documents but also from two supplementary sources: pre-generated expert knowledge for anticipated queries and on-demand external LLM-generated knowledge. To mitigate security risks, we adopt a local open-source generator and selectively utilize external LLMs only when prompts are deemed safe by a filtering mechanism. This approach enhances completeness, prevents data leakage, and reduces costs. In our evaluation on a report generation task in the automotive industry, SecMulti-RAG significantly outperforms traditional RAG - achieving 79.3 to 91.9 percent win rates across correctness, richness, and helpfulness in LLM-based evaluation, and 56.3 to 70.4 percent in human evaluation. This highlights SecMulti-RAG as a practical and secure solution for enterprise RAG.</p></details> |  |

However, deploying RAG on consumer-grade platforms is challenging due to limited memory and the increasing scale of both models and knowledge bases. In this work, we introduce RAGDoll, a resource-efficient, self-adaptive RAG serving system integrated with LLMs, specifically designed for resource-constrained platforms. RAGDoll exploits the insight that RAG retrieval and LLM generation impose different computational and memory demands, which in a traditional serial workflow result in substantial idle times and poor resource utilization. Based on this insight, RAGDoll decouples retrieval and generation into parallel pipelines, incorporating joint memory placement and dynamic batch scheduling strategies to optimize resource usage across diverse hardware devices and workloads. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAGDoll adapts effectively to various hardware configurations and LLM scales, achieving up to 3.6 times speedup in average latency compared to serial RAG systems based on vLLM.</p></details> |  |

This advancement has enabled their widespread deployment across sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and enterprise applications. RAG mitigates hallucinations by integrating external knowledge, yet introduces privacy risk and security risk, notably data breaching risk and data poisoning risk. While recent studies have explored prompt injection and poisoning attacks, there remains a significant gap in comprehensive research on controlling inbound and outbound query flows to mitigate these threats. In this paper, we propose an AI firewall, ControlNET, designed to safeguard RAG-based LLM systems from these vulnerabilities. ControlNET controls query flows by leveraging activation shift phenomena to detect adversarial queries and mitigate their impact through semantic divergence. We conduct comprehensive experiments on four different benchmark datasets including Msmarco, HotpotQA, FinQA, and MedicalSys using state-of-the-art open source LLMs (Llama3, Vicuna, and Mistral). Our results demonstrate that ControlNET achieves over 0.909 AUROC in detecting and mitigating security threats while preserving system harmlessness. Overall, ControlNET offers an effective, robust, harmless defense mechanism, marking a significant advancement toward the secure deployment of RAG-based LLM systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://ai.zjuicsr.cn/firewall</p></details> |

However, they also exhibit inherent limitations, such as outdated knowledge and susceptibility to hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm to address these issues, but it also introduces new vulnerabilities. Recent efforts have focused on the security of RAG-based LLMs, yet existing attack methods face three critical challenges: (1) their effectiveness declines sharply when only a limited number of poisoned texts can be injected into the knowledge database, (2) they lack sufficient stealth, as the attacks are often detectable by anomaly detection systems, which compromises their effectiveness, and (3) they rely on heuristic approaches to generate poisoned texts, lacking formal optimization frameworks and theoretic guarantees, which limits their effectiveness and applicability. To address these issues, we propose coordinated Prompt-RAG attack (PR-attack), a novel optimization-driven attack that introduces a small number of poisoned texts into the knowledge database while embedding a backdoor trigger within the prompt. When activated, the trigger causes the LLM to generate pre-designed responses to targeted queries, while maintaining normal behavior in other contexts. This ensures both high effectiveness and stealth. We formulate the attack generation process as a bilevel optimization problem leveraging a principled optimization framework to develop optimal poisoned texts and triggers. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PR-Attack, achieving a high attack success rate even with a limited number of poisoned texts and significantly improved stealth compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

CRs can be exploited for analyzing vulnerabilities and experimenting with the effectiveness of devised countermeasures, as well as serving as training environments for building cyber security skills and abilities for IT operators. This paper proposes ARCeR as an innovative solution for the automatic generation and deployment of CRs, starting from user-provided descriptions in a natural language. ARCeR relies on the Agentic RAG paradigm, which allows it to fully exploit state-of-art AI technologies. Experimental results show that ARCeR is able to successfully process prompts even in cases that LLMs or basic RAG systems are not able to cope with. Furthermore, ARCeR is able to target any CR framework provided that specific knowledge is made available to it.</p></details> |  |

In the retail domain, for example, the identification of fast changing and visually highly similar products and their properties are key to automated price-monitoring and product recommendation. This paper presents a novel Visual RAG pipeline that combines the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach and Vision Language Models (VLMs) for few-shot FGC. This Visual RAG pipeline extracts product and promotion data in advertisement leaflets from various retailers and simultaneously predicts fine-grained product ids along with price and discount information. Compared to previous approaches, the key characteristic of the Visual RAG pipeline is that it allows the prediction of novel products without re-training, simply by adding a few class samples to the RAG database. Comparing several VLM back-ends like GPT-4o [23], GPT-4o-mini [24], and Gemini 2.0 Flash [10], our approach achieves 86.8% accuracy on a diverse dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Shared Disk KV Cache Management for Efficient Multi-Instance Inference in RAG-Powered LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11765v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent large language models (LLMs) face increasing inference latency as input context length and model size continue to grow. In particular, the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique, which enhances LLM responses by incorporating external knowledge, exacerbates this issue by significantly increasing the number of input tokens. This expansion in token length leads to a substantial rise in computational overhead, particularly during the prefill stage, resulting in prolonged time-to-first-token (TTFT). To address this issue, this paper proposes a method to reduce TTFT by leveraging a disk-based key-value (KV) cache to lessen the computational burden during the prefill stage. We also introduce a disk-based shared KV cache management system, called Shared RAG-DCache, for multi-instance LLM RAG service environments. This system, together with an optimal system configuration, improves both throughput and latency under given resource constraints. Shared RAG-DCache exploits the locality of documents related to user queries in RAG, as well as the queueing delay in LLM inference services. It proactively generates and stores disk KV caches for query-related documents and shares them across multiple LLM instances to enhance inference performance. In experiments on a single host equipped with 2 GPUs and 1 CPU, Shared RAG-DCache achieved a 15~71% increase in throughput and up to a 12~65% reduction in latency, depending on the resource configuration.</p></details> |  |

By exploiting the inherent structure of the corpus, graph-based RAG methods further enrich this process by building a knowledge graph index and leveraging the structural nature of graphs. However, current graph-based RAG approaches seldom prioritize the design of graph structures. Inadequately designed graph not only impede the seamless integration of diverse graph algorithms but also result in workflow inconsistencies and degraded performance. To further unleash the potential of graph for RAG, we propose NodeRAG, a graph-centric framework introducing heterogeneous graph structures that enable the seamless and holistic integration of graph-based methodologies into the RAG workflow. By aligning closely with the capabilities of LLMs, this framework ensures a fully cohesive and efficient end-to-end process. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that NodeRAG exhibits performance advantages over previous methods, including GraphRAG and LightRAG, not only in indexing time, query time, and storage efficiency but also in delivering superior question-answering performance on multi-hop benchmarks and open-ended head-to-head evaluations with minimal retrieval tokens.

| **[Towards Automated Safety Requirements Derivation Using Agent-based RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11243v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the automated derivation of safety requirements in a self-driving vehicle use case, leveraging LLMs in combination with agent-based retrieval-augmented generation. Conventional approaches that utilise pre-trained LLMs to assist in safety analyses typically lack domain-specific knowledge. Existing RAG approaches address this issue, yet their performance deteriorates when handling complex queries and it becomes increasingly harder to retrieve the most relevant information. This is particularly relevant for safety-relevant applications. In this paper, we propose the use of agent-based RAG to derive safety requirements and show that the retrieved information is more relevant to the queries. We implement an agent-based approach on a document pool of automotive standards and the Apollo case study, as a representative example of an automated driving perception system. Our solution is tested on a data set of safety requirement questions and answers, extracted from the Apollo data. Evaluating a set of selected RAG metrics, we present and discuss advantages of a agent-based approach compared to default RAG methods.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |

While semi-supervised methods trained on only normal samples have gained traction, they often suffer from high false alarm rates and poor interpretability. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong multimodal reasoning capabilities, offering new opportunities for explainable anomaly detection. However, their high computational cost and lack of domain adaptation hinder real-time deployment and reliability. Inspired by dual complementary pathways in human visual perception, we propose SlowFastVAD, a hybrid framework that integrates a fast anomaly detector with a slow anomaly detector (namely a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) enhanced VLM), to address these limitations. Specifically, the fast detector first provides coarse anomaly confidence scores, and only a small subset of ambiguous segments, rather than the entire video, is further analyzed by the slower yet more interpretable VLM for elaborate detection and reasoning. Furthermore, to adapt VLMs to domain-specific VAD scenarios, we construct a knowledge base including normal patterns based on few normal samples and abnormal patterns inferred by VLMs. During inference, relevant patterns are retrieved and used to augment prompts for anomaly reasoning. Finally, we smoothly fuse the anomaly confidence of fast and slow detectors to enhance robustness of anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that SlowFastVAD effectively combines the strengths of both fast and slow detectors, and achieves remarkable detection accuracy and interpretability with significantly reduced computational overhead, making it well-suited for real-world VAD applications with high reliability requirements.</p></details> |  |

Recent research has increasingly concentrated on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks and their evolution into more advanced agent-based architectures within personalized settings to enhance user satisfaction. Building on this foundation, this survey systematically examines personalization across the three core stages of RAG: pre-retrieval, retrieval, and generation. Beyond RAG, we further extend its capabilities into the realm of Personalized LLM-based Agents, which enhance traditional RAG systems with agentic functionalities, including user understanding, personalized planning and execution, and dynamic generation.

| **[RAG-Based Fuzzing of Cross-Architecture Compilers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08967v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>OneAPI is an open standard that supports cross-architecture software development with minimal effort from developers. It brings DPC++ and C++ compilers which need to be thoroughly tested to verify their correctness, reliability, and security. Compilers have numerous code flows and optimization features. This process requires developers with deep understanding of the different compiler flows to craft testcases specific to target paths in the compiler. This testcase creation is a time-consuming and costly process. In this paper, we propose a large-language model (LLM)-based compiler fuzzing tool that integrates the concept of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). This tool automates the testcase generation task and relieves experienced compiler developers from investing time to craft testcase generation patterns. We test our proposed approach on the Intel DPC++/C++ compiler. This compiler compiles SYCL code and allows developers to offload it to different architectures, e.g. GPUs and CPUs from different vendors. Using this tool, we managed to identify 87 SYCL code test cases that lead to output value mismatch or compiler runtime errors when compiled using Intel DPC++ and clang++ compilers and run on different architectures. The testcases and the identified unexpected behaviors of the compilers under test were obtained within only few hours with no prior background on the compiler passes under tests. This tool facilitates efficient compiler fuzzing with reduced developer time requirements via the dynamic testcase creation capability provided by an LLM with RAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Adaptive Vector Index Partitioning Scheme for Low-Latency RAG Pipeline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08930v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance response quality by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with vector databases, enabling external knowledge retrieval to support language model reasoning. While RAG enables efficient question answering with smaller LLMs, existing optimizations for vector search and LLM serving have largely been developed in isolation. As a result, their integration often leads to suboptimal end-to-end performance. ... This paper introduces VectorLiteRAG, an optimized vector index partitioning mechanism designed for RAG systems that enhances the responsiveness of the system by jointly optimizing vector search and LLM serving across CPU and GPU system. A key challenge is to determine which indices and how much of the vector index should reside on the GPU and adjusting LLM batch sizes to balance the pipeline for lower Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and meeting user-defined Service-Level Objectives (SLOs). To address this, we leverage the insight that cluster access in vector databases exhibits access skew, where a subset of clusters are queried significantly more frequently than others. VectorLiteRAG exploits this property through an optimized memory distribution strategy, dynamically allocating the minimum number of vector indices corresponding to frequently accessed clusters onto the GPU HBM to ensure a balanced pipeline with the LLM for high responsiveness. This adaptive partitioning scheme is guided by a statistical model that informs memory allocation and workload distribution. Our evaluation demonstrates that VectorLiteRAG improves vector search responsiveness by 2x, significantly reduces end-to-end TTFT in RAG systems by intelligently balancing memory resources between vector search and LLM execution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Out of Style: RAG's Fragility to Linguistic Variation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08231v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the impressive performance of Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) systems across various NLP benchmarks, their robustness in handling real-world user-LLM interaction queries remains largely underexplored. This presents a critical gap for practical deployment, where user queries exhibit greater linguistic variations and can trigger cascading errors across interdependent RAG components. In this work, we systematically analyze how varying four linguistic dimensions (formality, readability, politeness, and grammatical correctness) impact RAG performance. We evaluate two retrieval models and nine LLMs, ranging from 3 to 72 billion parameters, across four information-seeking Question Answering (QA) datasets. Our results reveal that linguistic reformulations significantly impact both retrieval and generation stages, leading to a relative performance drop of up to 40.41% in Recall@5 scores for less formal queries and 38.86% in answer match scores for queries containing grammatical errors. Notably, RAG systems exhibit greater sensitivity to such variations compared to LLM-only generations, highlighting their vulnerability to error propagation due to linguistic shifts. These findings highlight the need for improved robustness techniques to enhance reliability in diverse user interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A System for Comprehensive Assessment of RAG Frameworks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07803v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a standard paradigm for enhancing the factual accuracy and contextual relevance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating retrieval mechanisms. However, existing evaluation frameworks fail to provide a holistic black-box approach to assessing RAG systems, especially in real-world deployment scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce SCARF (System for Comprehensive Assessment of RAG Frameworks), a modular and flexible evaluation framework designed to benchmark deployed RAG applications systematically. SCARF provides an end-to-end, black-box evaluation methodology, enabling a limited-effort comparison across diverse RAG frameworks. Our framework supports multiple deployment configurations and facilitates automated testing across vector databases and LLM serving strategies, producing a detailed performance report. Moreover, SCARF integrates practical considerations such as response coherence, providing a scalable and adaptable solution for researchers and industry professionals evaluating RAG applications. Using the REST APIs interface, we demonstrate how SCARF can be applied to real-world scenarios, showcasing its flexibility in assessing different RAG frameworks and configurations. SCARF is available at GitHub repository.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report, 7 pages, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Given the overwhelming volume and inherent complexity of scientific collections, conventional search systems often lack necessary intuitiveness and interactivity, presenting substantial barriers for learners, educators, and researchers. CollEx addresses these limitations by employing state-of-the-art Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) as multimodal agents accessible through an intuitive chat interface. By abstracting complex interactions via specialized agents equipped with advanced tools, CollEx facilitates curiosity-driven exploration, significantly simplifying access to diverse scientific collections and records therein. Our system integrates textual and visual modalities, supporting educational scenarios that are helpful for teachers, pupils, students, and researchers by fostering independent exploration as well as scientific excitement and curiosity. Furthermore, CollEx serves the research community by discovering interdisciplinary connections and complementing visual data. We illustrate the effectiveness of our system through a proof-of-concept application containing over 64,000 unique records across 32 collections from a local scientific collection from a public university.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging LLMs for Utility-Focused Annotation: Reducing Manual Effort for Retrieval and RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05220v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval models typically rely on costly human-labeled query-document relevance annotations for training and evaluation. To reduce this cost and leverage the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in relevance judgments, we aim to explore whether LLM-generated annotations can effectively replace human annotations in training retrieval models. Retrieval usually emphasizes relevance, which indicates "topic-relatedness" of a document to a query, while in RAG, the value of a document (or utility) depends on how it contributes to answer generation. Recognizing this mismatch, some researchers use LLM performance on downstream tasks with documents as labels, but this approach requires manual answers for specific tasks, leading to high costs and limited generalization. In another line of work, prompting LLMs to select useful documents as RAG references eliminates the need for human annotation and is not task-specific. If we leverage LLMs' utility judgments to annotate retrieval data, we may retain cross-task generalization without human annotation in large-scale corpora. Therefore, we investigate utility-focused annotation via LLMs for large-scale retriever training data across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings on the retrieval and RAG tasks. To reduce the impact of low-quality positives labeled by LLMs, we design a novel loss function, i.e., Disj-InfoNCE. Our experiments reveal that: (1) Retrievers trained on utility-focused annotations significantly outperform those trained on human annotations in the out-of-domain setting on both tasks, demonstrating superior generalization capabilities. (2) LLM annotation does not replace human annotation in the in-domain setting. However, incorporating just 20% human-annotated data enables retrievers trained with utility-focused annotations to match the performance of models trained entirely with human annotations.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Diversity Enhances an LLM's Performance in RAG and Long-context Task](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09017v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the challenge of context window limitations, primarily due to the quadratic time complexity of the self-attention mechanism (\(O(N^2)\), where \(N\) denotes the context window length). This constraint impacts tasks such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in question answering (Q\&A) and long context summarization. A common approach involves selecting content with the highest similarity to the query; however, this often leads to redundancy and the exclusion of diverse yet relevant information. Building on principles from Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) and Farthest Point Sampling (FPS), we integrate diversity into the content selection process. Our findings reveal that incorporating diversity substantially increases the recall of selecting relevant sentences or chunks before LLM-based Q\&A and summarization. These results highlight the importance of maintaining diversity in future LLM applications to further improve summarization and Q\&A outcomes.</p></details> |  |

| **[Hierarchical Planning for Complex Tasks with Knowledge Graph-RAG and Symbolic Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04578v1)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise as robotic planners but often struggle with long-horizon and complex tasks, especially in specialized environments requiring external knowledge. While hierarchical planning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) address some of these challenges, they remain insufficient on their own and a deeper integration is required for achieving more reliable systems. To this end, we propose a neuro-symbolic approach that enhances LLMs-based planners with Knowledge Graph-based RAG for hierarchical plan generation. This method decomposes complex tasks into manageable subtasks, further expanded into executable atomic action sequences. To ensure formal correctness and proper decomposition, we integrate a Symbolic Validator, which also functions as a failure detector by aligning expected and observed world states. Our evaluation against baseline methods demonstrates the consistent significant advantages of integrating hierarchical planning, symbolic verification, and RAG across tasks of varying complexity and different LLMs. Additionally, our experimental setup and novel metrics not only validate our approach for complex planning but also serve as a tool for assessing LLMs' reasoning and compositional capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Accurate and efficient scenario data search is critical for both online vehicle decision-making and planning, and offline scenario generation and simulations, as it allows for leveraging the scenario experiences to improve the overall performance. Especially with the application of large language models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) systems in autonomous driving, urgent requirements are put forward. In this paper, we introduce the Driving-RAG framework to address the challenges of efficient scenario data embedding, search, and applications for RAG systems. Our embedding model aligns fundamental scenario information and scenario distance metrics in the vector space. The typical scenario sampling method combined with hierarchical navigable small world can perform efficient scenario vector search to achieve high efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. In addition, the reorganization mechanism by graph knowledge enhances the relevance to the prompt scenarios and augment LLM generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on typical trajectory planning task for complex interactive scenarios such as ramps and intersections, showcasing its advantages for RAG applications.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel perspective on software testing by positing bug detection and coding with fewer bugs as two interconnected problems that share a common goal, which is reducing bugs with limited resources. We extend our previous work on AI-assisted programming, which supports code auto-completion and chatbot-powered Q&A, to the realm of software testing. We introduce Copilot for Testing, an automated testing system that synchronizes bug detection with codebase updates, leveraging context-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Our evaluation demonstrates a 31.2% improvement in bug detection accuracy, a 12.6% increase in critical test coverage, and a 10.5% higher user acceptance rate, highlighting the transformative potential of AI-driven technologies in modern software development practices.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for publication in IEEE Software (DOI: 10.1109/MS.2025.3549628)</p></details> |

Producing such semantic co-speech gestures has been a major challenge for the existing neural systems that can generate rhythmic beat gestures, but struggle to produce semantically meaningful gestures. Therefore, we present RAG-Gesture, a diffusion-based gesture generation approach that leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce natural-looking and semantically rich gestures. Our neuro-explicit gesture generation approach is designed to produce semantic gestures grounded in interpretable linguistic knowledge. We achieve this by using explicit domain knowledge to retrieve exemplar motions from a database of co-speech gestures. Once retrieved, we then inject these semantic exemplar gestures into our diffusion-based gesture generation pipeline using DDIM inversion and retrieval guidance at the inference time without any need of training. Further, we propose a control paradigm for guidance, that allows the users to modulate the amount of influence each retrieval insertion has over the generated sequence. Our comparative evaluations demonstrate the validity of our approach against recent gesture generation approaches. The reader is urged to explore the results on our project page.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

| **[CacheBlend: Fast Large Language Model Serving for RAG with Cached Knowledge Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16444v3)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often incorporate multiple text chunks in their inputs to provide the necessary contexts. To speed up the prefill of the long LLM inputs, one can pre-compute the KV cache of a text and re-use the KV cache when the context is reused as the prefix of another LLM input. However, the reused text chunks are not always the input prefix, which makes precomputed KV caches not directly usable since they ignore the text's cross-attention with the preceding texts. Thus, the benefits of reusing KV caches remain largely unrealized. This paper tackles just one challenge: when an LLM input contains multiple text chunks, how to quickly combine their precomputed KV caches in order to achieve the same generation quality as the expensive full prefill (i.e., without reusing KV cache)? This challenge naturally arises in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) where the input is supplemented with multiple retrieved texts as the context. We present CacheBlend, a scheme that reuses the precomputed KV caches, regardless prefix or not, and selectively recomputes the KV values of a small subset of tokens to partially update each reused KV cache. In the meantime, the small extra delay for recomputing some tokens can be pipelined with the retrieval of KV caches within the same job, allowing CacheBlend to store KV caches in slower devices with more storage capacity while retrieving them without increasing the inference delay. By comparing CacheBlend with the state-of-the-art KV cache reusing schemes on three open-source LLMs of various sizes and four popular benchmark datasets of different tasks, we show that CacheBlend reduces time-to-first-token (TTFT) by 2.2-3.3x and increases the inference throughput by 2.8-5x from full KV recompute without compromising generation quality.

In real-world scenarios, user questions often require retrieving answers that are distributed across multiple tables. GraphRAG has recently attracted much attention for enhancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities by organizing external knowledge to address ad-hoc and complex questions, exemplifying a promising direction for cross-table question answering. In this paper, to address the current gap in available data, we first introduce a multi-table benchmark, MutliTableQA, comprising 60k tables and 25k user queries collected from real-world sources. Then, we propose the first Graph-Table-RAG framework, namely GTR, which reorganizes table corpora into a heterogeneous graph, employs a hierarchical coarse-to-fine retrieval process to extract the most relevant tables, and integrates graph-aware prompting for downstream LLMs' tabular reasoning. Extensive experiments show that GTR exhibits superior cross-table question-answering performance while maintaining high deployment efficiency, demonstrating its real-world practical applicability.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |

Large language models (LLMs) have made it significantly easier to prototype such retrieval and reasoning data pipelines. However, implementing these pipelines efficiently still demands significant effort and has several challenges. This often involves orchestrating heterogeneous data systems, managing data movement, and handling low-level implementation details, e.g., LLM context management. To address these challenges, we introduce FlockMTL: an extension for DBMSs that deeply integrates LLM capabilities and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). FlockMTL includes model-driven scalar and aggregate functions, enabling chained predictions through tuple-level mappings and reductions. Drawing inspiration from the relational model, FlockMTL incorporates: (i) cost-based optimizations, which seamlessly apply techniques such as batching and caching; and (ii) resource independence, enabled through novel SQL DDL abstractions: PROMPT and MODEL, introduced as first-class schema objects alongside TABLE. FlockMTL streamlines the development of knowledge-intensive analytical applications, and its optimizations ease the implementation burden.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Routing RAG: Binding Selective Retrieval with Knowledge Verbalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01018v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Selective retrieval improves retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by reducing distractions from low-quality retrievals and improving efficiency. However, existing approaches under-utilize the inherent knowledge of large language models (LLMs), leading to suboptimal retrieval decisions and degraded generation performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Self-Routing RAG (SR-RAG), a novel framework that binds selective retrieval with knowledge verbalization. SR-RAG enables an LLM to dynamically decide between external retrieval and verbalizing its own parametric knowledge. To this end, we design a multi-task objective that jointly optimizes an LLM on knowledge source selection, knowledge verbalization, and response generation. We further introduce dynamic knowledge source inference via nearest neighbor search to improve the accuracy of knowledge source decision under domain shifts. Fine-tuning three LLMs with SR-RAG significantly improves both their response accuracy and inference latency. Compared to the strongest selective retrieval baseline, SR-RAG reduces retrievals by 29% while improving the performance by 5.1%.</p></details> | Work in Progress |

RAG primarily relies on the query-chunk text-to-text similarity in the embedding space for retrieval and can fail to capture deeper semantic relationships across chunks, is highly sensitive to chunking strategies, and is prone to hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose TOBUGraph, a graph-based retrieval framework that first constructs the knowledge graph from unstructured data dynamically and automatically. Using LLMs, TOBUGraph extracts structured knowledge and diverse relationships among data, going beyond RAG's text-to-text similarity. Retrieval is achieved through graph traversal, leveraging the extracted relationships and structures to enhance retrieval accuracy, eliminating the need for chunking configurations while reducing hallucination. We demonstrate TOBUGraph's effectiveness in TOBU, a real-world application in production for personal memory organization and retrieval. Our evaluation using real user data demonstrates that TOBUGraph outperforms multiple RAG implementations in both precision and recall, significantly improving user experience through improved retrieval accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contradiction Detection in RAG Systems: Evaluating LLMs as Context Validators for Improved Information Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00180v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have emerged as a powerful method for enhancing large language models (LLMs) with up-to-date information. However, the retrieval step in RAG can sometimes surface documents containing contradictory information, particularly in rapidly evolving domains such as news. These contradictions can significantly impact the performance of LLMs, leading to inconsistent or erroneous outputs. This study addresses this critical challenge in two ways. First, we present a novel data generation framework to simulate different types of contradictions that may occur in the retrieval stage of a RAG system. Second, we evaluate the robustness of different LLMs in performing as context validators, assessing their ability to detect contradictory information within retrieved document sets. Our experimental results reveal that context validation remains a challenging task even for state-of-the-art LLMs, with performance varying significantly across different types of contradictions. While larger models generally perform better at contradiction detection, the effectiveness of different prompting strategies varies across tasks and model architectures. We find that chain-of-thought prompting shows notable improvements for some models but may hinder performance in others, highlighting the complexity of the task and the need for more robust approaches to context validation in RAG systems.</p></details> |  |

Using LLaMA 3, we evaluate these approaches on emotion classification and mental health condition detection tasks across two datasets. Fine-tuning achieves the highest accuracy (91% for emotion classification, 80% for mental health conditions) but requires substantial computational resources and large training sets, while prompt engineering and RAG offer more flexible deployment with moderate performance (40-68% accuracy). Our findings provide practical insights for implementing LLM-based solutions in mental health applications, highlighting the trade-offs between accuracy, computational requirements, and deployment flexibility.</p></details> |  |

A robust benchmark dataset must satisfy three key criteria: quality, diversity, and difficulty, which capturing the complexity of reasoning based on hops and the distribution of supporting evidence. In this paper, we propose MHTS (Multi-Hop Tree Structure), a novel dataset synthesis framework that systematically controls multi-hop reasoning complexity by leveraging a multi-hop tree structure to generate logically connected, multi-chunk queries. Our fine-grained difficulty estimation formula exhibits a strong correlation with the overall performance metrics of a RAG system, validating its effectiveness in assessing both retrieval and answer generation capabilities. By ensuring high-quality, diverse, and difficulty-controlled queries, our approach enhances RAG evaluation and benchmarking capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Systematic Knowledge Injection into Large Language Models via Diverse Augmentation for Domain-Specific RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08356v3)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a prominent method for incorporating domain knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs). While RAG enhances response relevance by incorporating retrieved domain knowledge in the context, retrieval errors can still lead to hallucinations and incorrect answers. To recover from retriever failures, domain knowledge is injected by fine-tuning the model to generate the correct response, even in the case of retrieval errors. However, we observe that without systematic knowledge augmentation, fine-tuned LLMs may memorize new information but still fail to extract relevant domain knowledge, leading to poor performance. In this work, we present a novel framework that significantly enhances the fine-tuning process by augmenting the training data in two ways -- context augmentation and knowledge paraphrasing. In context augmentation, we create multiple training samples for a given QA pair by varying the relevance of the retrieved information, teaching the model when to ignore and when to rely on retrieved content. In knowledge paraphrasing, we fine-tune with multiple answers to the same question, enabling LLMs to better internalize specialized knowledge. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting due to fine-tuning, we add a domain-specific identifier to a question and also utilize a replay buffer containing general QA pairs. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our method over existing techniques, achieving up to 10\% relative gain in token-level recall while preserving the LLM's generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 14 tables, to be published in NAACL 2025</p></details> |

Evaluating Fairness in Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19804v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has recently gained significant attention for its enhanced ability to integrate external knowledge sources into open-domain question answering (QA) tasks. However, it remains unclear how these models address fairness concerns, particularly with respect to sensitive attributes such as gender, geographic location, and other demographic factors. First, as language models evolve to prioritize utility, like improving exact match accuracy, fairness considerations may have been largely overlooked. Second, the complex, multi-component architecture of RAG methods poses challenges in identifying and mitigating biases, as each component is optimized for distinct objectives. In this paper, we aim to empirically evaluate fairness in several RAG methods. We propose a fairness evaluation framework tailored to RAG, using scenario-based questions and analyzing disparities across demographic attributes. Our experimental results indicate that, despite recent advances in utility-driven optimization, fairness issues persist in both the retrieval and generation stages. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions to address fairness concerns throughout the RAG pipeline.

To enrich the RAG context, we propose providing Large Language Models (LLMs) with author-specific features, such as average sentiment polarity and frequently used words, in addition to past samples from the author's profile. We introduce a new feature called Contrastive Examples: documents from other authors are retrieved to help LLM identify what makes an author's style unique in comparison to others. Our experiments show that adding a couple of sentences about the named entities, dependency patterns, and words a person uses frequently significantly improves personalized text generation. Combining features with contrastive examples boosts the performance further, achieving a relative 15% improvement over baseline RAG while outperforming the benchmarks. Our results show the value of fine-grained features for better personalization, while opening a new research dimension for including contrastive examples as a complement with RAG. We release our code publicly.</p></details> |  |

However, these Text-to-SQL (Text2SQL) systems face inherent limitations, hallucinations, outdated knowledge, and untraceable reasoning. To address these challenges, the integration of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with Text2SQL models has gained traction. RAG serves as a retrieval mechanism, providing essential contextual information, such as table schemas and metadata, to enhance the query generation process. Despite their potential, RAG + Text2SQL systems are susceptible to the quality and size of retrieved documents. While richer document content can improve schema relevance and retrieval accuracy, it also introduces noise, increasing the risk of hallucinations and reducing query fidelity as the prompt size of the Text2SQL model increases. This research investigates the nuanced trade-off between document size and quality, aiming to strike a balance that optimizes system performance. Key thresholds are identified where performance degradation occurs, along with actionable strategies to mitigate these challenges. Additionally, we explore the phenomenon of hallucinations in Text2SQL models, emphasizing the critical role of curated document presentation in minimizing errors. Our findings provide a roadmap for enhancing the robustness of RAG + Text2SQL systems, offering practical insights for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

We propose a dynamic retrieval gating mechanism coupled with expert routing, enabling the model to selectively consult an external knowledge store or rely on specialized internal experts based on the query's needs. The paper lays out the theoretical foundations of ExpertRAG, including a probabilistic formulation that treats retrieval and expert selection as latent decisions, and mathematical justifications for its efficiency in both computation and knowledge utilization. We derive formulae to quantify the expected computational cost savings from selective retrieval and the capacity gains from sparse expert utilization. A comparative analysis positions ExpertRAG against standard RAG (with always-on retrieval) and pure MoE models (e.g., Switch Transformer, Mixtral) to highlight its unique balance between parametric knowledge and non-parametric retrieval. We also outline an experimental validation strategy, proposing benchmarks and evaluation protocols to test ExpertRAG's performance on factual recall, generalization, and inference efficiency. The proposed framework, although presented theoretically, is supported by insights from prior work in RAG and MoE, and is poised to provide more factual, efficient, and adaptive generation by leveraging the best of both paradigms. In summary, ExpertRAG contributes a new perspective on scaling and augmenting language models, backed by a thorough analysis and a roadmap for empirical validation.</p></details> | 30 pages, 4 figures |

The two mainstream solutions to incorporate memory into the generation process are long-context LLMs and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). In this paper, we first systematically compare these two types of solutions on three renovated/new datasets and show that (1) long-context solutions, although more expensive, shall be easier to capture the big picture and better answer queries which require considering the memory as a whole; and (2) when the queries concern specific information, RAG solutions shall be more competitive especially when the keywords can be explicitly matched. Therefore, we propose a novel method RAG-Tuned-LLM which fine-tunes a relative small (e.g., 7B) LLM using the data generated following the RAG principles, so it can combine the advantages of both solutions. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that RAG-Tuned-LLM can beat long-context LLMs and RAG methods across a wide range of query types.</p></details> |  |

The recent purposed Mixed-Precision Over-the-Air Federated Learning (MP-OTA-FL) enables clients to operate at appropriate precision levels based on their heterogeneous hardware, taking advantages of the larger trade-off space while covering the quantization overheads in the mixed-precision modulation scheme for the OTA aggregation process. A key to further exploring the potential of the MP-OTA-FL framework is the optimization of client precision levels. The choice of precision level hinges on multifaceted factors including hardware capability, potential client contribution, and user satisfaction, among which factors can be difficult to define or quantify. In this paper, we propose a RAG-based User Profiling for precision planning framework that integrates retrieval-augmented LLMs and dynamic client profiling to optimize satisfaction and contributions. This includes a hybrid interface for gathering device/user insights and an RAG database storing historical quantization decisions with feedback. Experiments show that our method boosts satisfaction, energy savings, and global model accuracy in MP-OTA-FL systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, submitted to IEEE VTC 2025 fall for possible publication</p></details> |

Chatbots as question-answering systems can help in solving these challenges. LLM chatbots use NLP techniques to establish connections between topics and accurately respond to complex questions. These capabilities make it perfect for enlightenment on religion as a question-answering chatbot. However, LLMs also tend to generate false information, known as hallucination. Also, the chatbots' responses can include content that insults personal religious beliefs, interfaith conflicts, and controversial or sensitive topics. It must avoid such cases without promoting hate speech or offending certain groups of people or their beliefs. This study uses a vector database-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to enhance the accuracy and transparency of LLMs. Our question-answering system is called "MufassirQAS". We created a database consisting of several open-access books that include Turkish context. These books contain Turkish translations and interpretations of Islam. This database is utilized to answer religion-related questions and ensure our answers are trustworthy. The relevant part of the dataset, which LLM also uses, is presented along with the answer. We have put careful effort into creating system prompts that give instructions to prevent harmful, offensive, or disrespectful responses to respect people's values and provide reliable results. The system answers and shares additional information, such as the page number from the respective book and the articles referenced for obtaining the information. MufassirQAS and ChatGPT are also tested with sensitive questions. We got better performance with our system. Study and enhancements are still in progress. Results and future works are given.</p></details> |  |
| **[SOSecure: Safer Code Generation with RAG and StackOverflow Discussions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13654v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for automated code generation. Their reliance on infrequently updated pretraining data leaves them unaware of newly discovered vulnerabilities and evolving security standards, making them prone to producing insecure code. In contrast, developer communities on Stack Overflow (SO) provide an ever-evolving repository of knowledge, where security vulnerabilities are actively discussed and addressed through collective expertise. These community-driven insights remain largely untapped by LLMs. This paper introduces SOSecure, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that leverages the collective security expertise found in SO discussions to improve the security of LLM-generated code. We build a security-focused knowledge base by extracting SO answers and comments that explicitly identify vulnerabilities. Unlike common uses of RAG, SOSecure triggers after code has been generated to find discussions that identify flaws in similar code. These are used in a prompt to an LLM to consider revising the code. Evaluation across three datasets (SALLM, LLMSecEval, and LMSys) show that SOSecure achieves strong fix rates of 71.7%, 91.3%, and 96.7% respectively, compared to prompting GPT-4 without relevant discussions (49.1%, 56.5%, and 37.5%), and outperforms multiple other baselines. SOSecure operates as a language-agnostic complement to existing LLMs, without requiring retraining or fine-tuning, making it easy to deploy. Our results underscore the importance of maintaining active developer forums, which have dropped substantially in usage with LLM adoptions.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we proposed MES-RAG framework, which enhances entity-specific query handling and provides accurate, secure, and consistent responses. MES-RAG introduces proactive security measures that ensure system integrity by applying protections prior to data access. Additionally, the system supports real-time multi-modal outputs, including text, images, audio, and video, seamlessly integrating into existing RAG architectures. Experimental results demonstrate that MES-RAG significantly improves both accuracy and recall, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing the security and utility of question-answering, increasing accuracy to 0.83 (+0.25) on targeted task.

| **[Privacy-Aware RAG: Secure and Isolated Knowledge Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15548v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in real-world applications has heightened concerns about the confidentiality and integrity of their proprietary knowledge bases. These knowledge bases, which play a critical role in enhancing the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly vulnerable to breaches that could compromise sensitive information. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an advanced encryption methodology designed to protect RAG systems from unauthorized access and data leakage. Our approach encrypts both textual content and its corresponding embeddings prior to storage, ensuring that all data remains securely encrypted. This mechanism restricts access to authorized entities with the appropriate decryption keys, thereby significantly reducing the risk of unintended data exposure. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our encryption strategy preserves the performance and functionality of RAG pipelines, ensuring compatibility across diverse domains and applications. To validate the robustness of our method, we provide comprehensive security proofs that highlight its resilience against potential threats and vulnerabilities. These proofs also reveal limitations in existing approaches, which often lack robustness, adaptability, or reliance on open-source models. Our findings suggest that integrating advanced encryption techniques into the design and deployment of RAG systems can effectively enhance privacy safeguards. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on improving security measures for AI-driven services and advocates for stricter data protection standards within RAG architectures.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advancements, LLMs still face significant challenges in reasoning with structured data, handling dynamic knowledge evolution, and mitigating hallucinations, particularly in mission-critical domains. Our proposed RAG-KG-IL framework addresses these limitations by employing a multi-agent architecture that enables continuous knowledge updates, integrates structured knowledge, and incorporates autonomous agents for enhanced explainability and reasoning. The framework utilizes RAG to ensure the generated responses are grounded in verifiable information, while KGs provide structured domain knowledge for improved consistency and depth of understanding. The Incremental Learning approach allows for dynamic updates to the knowledge base without full retraining, significantly reducing computational overhead and improving the model's adaptability. We evaluate the framework using real-world case studies involving health-related queries, comparing it to state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o and a RAG-only baseline. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces hallucination rates and improves answer completeness and reasoning accuracy. The results underscore the potential of combining RAG, KGs, and multi-agent systems to create intelligent, adaptable systems capable of real-time knowledge integration and reasoning in complex domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Relevance Isn't All You Need: Scaling RAG Systems With Inference-Time Compute Via Multi-Criteria Reranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07104v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern Large Language Model (LLM) systems typically rely on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) which aims to gather context that is useful for response generation. These RAG systems typically optimize strictly towards retrieving context that is maximally relevant to the query. However, conventional theory suggests that retrieval systems which seek to maximize context relevance without any additional explicit criteria can create information bottlenecks. We reaffirm this finding in the modern age of LLM's by showing that in standard RAG pipelines, maximizing for context relevance alone can degrade downstream response quality. In response, we show evaluations of existing RAG methods which account for both context relevance and answer quality. These evaluations introduce a novel finding that existing RAG systems scale poorly with inference time compute usage when considering our combined metric. We introduce "RErank BEyond reLevance (REBEL)", which enables RAG systems to scale with inference-time compute via injection of multi-criteria optimization using Chain-of-Thought prompting (and optionally Multi-Turn dialogue). Ultimately, this enables a new performance/speed tradeoff curve, where RAG systems are able to achieve both higher relevance of retrieved contexts and superior answer quality as inference time increases. Code for the implementation of our method in llama-index can be found at the following PR: https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/pull/17590. Code for running experiments using this llama-index implementation can be found at https://github.com/microsoft/REBEL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taxonomic Reasoning for Rare Arthropods: Combining Dense Image Captioning and RAG for Interpretable Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10886v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of pressing climate change challenges and the significant biodiversity loss among arthropods, automated taxonomic classification from organismal images is a subject of intense research. However, traditional AI pipelines based on deep neural visual architectures such as CNNs or ViTs face limitations such as degraded performance on the long-tail of classes and the inability to reason about their predictions. We integrate image captioning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) to enhance biodiversity monitoring, showing particular promise for characterizing rare and unknown arthropod species. While a naive Vision-Language Model (VLM) excels in classifying images of common species, the RAG model enables classification of rarer taxa by matching explicit textual descriptions of taxonomic features to contextual biodiversity text data from external sources. The RAG model shows promise in reducing overconfidence and enhancing accuracy relative to naive LLMs, suggesting its viability in capturing the nuances of taxonomic hierarchy, particularly at the challenging family and genus levels. Our findings highlight the potential for modern vision-language AI pipelines to support biodiversity conservation initiatives, emphasizing the role of comprehensive data curation and collaboration with citizen science platforms to improve species identification, unknown species characterization and ultimately inform conservation strategies.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |

In the Query-Focused Summarization (QFS) task, GraphRAG-based approaches have notably enhanced the comprehensiveness and diversity of generated responses. However, existing GraphRAG-based approaches predominantly focus on coarse-grained information summarization without being aware of the specific query, and the retrieved content lacks sufficient contextual information to generate comprehensive responses. To address the deficiencies of current RAG systems, we propose Context-Aware Fine-Grained Graph RAG (FG-RAG) to enhance the performance of the QFS task. FG-RAG employs Context-Aware Entity Expansion in graph retrieval to expand the coverage of retrieved entities in the graph, thus providing enough contextual information for the retrieved content. Furthermore, FG-RAG utilizes Query-Level Fine-Grained Summarization to incorporate fine-grained details during response generation, enhancing query awareness for the generated summarization. Our evaluation demonstrates that FG-RAG outperforms other RAG systems in multiple metrics of comprehensiveness, diversity, and empowerment when handling the QFS task. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/BuptWululu/FG-RAG.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces ClaimTrust, a propagation-based trust scoring framework that dynamically evaluates the reliability of documents in a RAG system. Using a modified PageRank-inspired algorithm, ClaimTrust propagates trust scores across documents based on relationships derived from extracted factual claims. We preprocess and analyze 814 political news articles from Kaggle's Fake News Detection Dataset to extract 2,173 unique claims and classify 965 meaningful relationships (supporting or contradicting). By representing the dataset as a document graph, ClaimTrust iteratively updates trust scores until convergence, effectively differentiating trustworthy articles from unreliable ones. Our methodology, which leverages embedding-based filtering for efficient claim comparison and relationship classification, achieves a 11.2% of significant connections while maintaining computational scalability. Experimental results demonstrate that ClaimTrust successfully assigns higher trust scores to verified documents while penalizing those containing false information. Future directions include fine-tuned claim extract and compare (Li et al., 2022), parameter optimization, enhanced language model utilization, and robust evaluation metrics to generalize the framework across diverse datasets and domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

To effectively assess their video comprehension capabilities, long video understanding benchmarks, such as Video-MME and MLVU, are proposed. However, these benchmarks directly use uniform frame sampling for testing, which results in significant information loss and affects the accuracy of the evaluations in reflecting the true abilities of MLLMs. To address this, we propose RAG-Adapter, a plug-and-play framework that reduces information loss during testing by sampling frames most relevant to the given question. Additionally, we introduce a Grouped-supervised Contrastive Learning (GCL) method to further enhance sampling effectiveness of RAG-Adapter through fine-tuning on our constructed MMAT dataset. Finally, we test numerous baseline MLLMs on various video understanding benchmarks, finding that RAG-Adapter sampling consistently outperforms uniform sampling (e.g., Accuracy of GPT-4o increases by 9.3 percent on Video-MME), providing a more accurate testing method for long video benchmarks.</p></details> | 37 pages, 36 figures |

Predictive maintenance (PdM) in such settings demands methodologies that are adaptive, transferable, and capable of integrating domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we present RAAD-LLM, a novel framework for adaptive anomaly detection, leveraging large language models (LLMs) integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This approach addresses the aforementioned PdM challenges. By effectively utilizing domain-specific knowledge, RAAD-LLM enhances the detection of anomalies in time series data without requiring fine-tuning on specific datasets. The framework's adaptability mechanism enables it to adjust its understanding of normal operating conditions dynamically, thus increasing detection accuracy. We validate this methodology through a real-world application for a plastics manufacturing plant and the Skoltech Anomaly Benchmark (SKAB). Results show significant improvements over our previous model with an accuracy increase from 70.7% to 88.6% on the real-world dataset. By allowing for the enriching of input series data with semantics, RAAD-LLM incorporates multimodal capabilities that facilitate more collaborative decision-making between the model and plant operators. Overall, our findings support RAAD-LLM's ability to revolutionize anomaly detection methodologies in PdM, potentially leading to a paradigm shift in how anomaly detection is implemented across various industries.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2411.00914</p></details> |

To bridge this gap, we introduce OpenRAG, a RAG framework that is optimized end-to-end by tuning the retriever to capture in-context relevance, enabling adaptation to the diverse and evolving needs. Extensive experiments across a wide range of tasks demonstrate that OpenRAG, by tuning a retriever end-to-end, leads to a consistent improvement of 4.0% over the original retriever, consistently outperforming existing state-of-the-art retrievers by 2.1%. Additionally, our results indicate that for some tasks, an end-to-end tuned 0.2B retriever can achieve improvements that surpass those of RAG-oriented or instruction-tuned 8B large language models (LLMs), highlighting the cost-effectiveness of our approach in enhancing RAG systems.</p></details> |  |

As an essential part of RAG, external knowledge bases are commonly built by extracting structured data from unstructured PDF documents using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However, given the imperfect prediction of OCR and the inherent non-uniform representation of structured data, knowledge bases inevitably contain various OCR noises. In this paper, we introduce OHRBench, the first benchmark for understanding the cascading impact of OCR on RAG systems. OHRBench includes 8,561 carefully selected unstructured document images from seven real-world RAG application domains, along with 8,498 Q&A pairs derived from multimodal elements in documents, challenging existing OCR solutions used for RAG. To better understand OCR's impact on RAG systems, we identify two primary types of OCR noise: Semantic Noise and Formatting Noise and apply perturbation to generate a set of structured data with varying degrees of each OCR noise. Using OHRBench, we first conduct a comprehensive evaluation of current OCR solutions and reveal that none is competent for constructing high-quality knowledge bases for RAG systems. We then systematically evaluate the impact of these two noise types and demonstrate the trend relationship between the degree of OCR noise and RAG performance. Our OHRBench, including PDF documents, Q&As, and the ground truth structured data are released at: https://github.com/opendatalab/OHR-Bench</p></details> | Work in progress |

We demonstrate that RAG systems that operate on databases with untrusted content are vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks we call jamming. An adversary can add a single ``blocker'' document to the database that will be retrieved in response to a specific query and result in the RAG system not answering this query, ostensibly because it lacks relevant information or because the answer is unsafe. We describe and measure the efficacy of several methods for generating blocker documents, including a new method based on black-box optimization. Our method (1) does not rely on instruction injection, (2) does not require the adversary to know the embedding or LLM used by the target RAG system, and (3) does not employ an auxiliary LLM. We evaluate jamming attacks on several embeddings and LLMs and demonstrate that the existing safety metrics for LLMs do not capture their vulnerability to jamming. We then discuss defenses against blocker documents.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in USENIX Security Symposium 2025</p></details> |

However, the specialized nature of biochemical data often necessitates costly domain-specific fine-tuning, posing critical challenges. First, it hinders the application of more flexible general-purpose LLMs in cutting-edge drug discovery tasks. More importantly, it impedes the rapid integration of the vast amounts of scientific data continuously generated through experiments and research. To investigate these challenges, we propose CLADD, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-empowered agentic system tailored to drug discovery tasks. Through the collaboration of multiple LLM agents, CLADD dynamically retrieves information from biomedical knowledge bases, contextualizes query molecules, and integrates relevant evidence to generate responses -- all without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. Crucially, we tackle key obstacles in applying RAG workflows to biochemical data, including data heterogeneity, ambiguity, and multi-source integration. We demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of this framework across a variety of drug discovery tasks, showing that it outperforms general-purpose and domain-specific LLMs as well as traditional deep learning approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Machi...</summary><p>Machine Learning, Drug Discovery</p></details> |

However, these modules are usually separately trained. We argue that a system like RAG that incorporates multiple modules should be jointly optimized to achieve optimal performance. To demonstrate this, we design a specific pipeline called \textbf{SmartRAG} that includes a policy network and a retriever. The policy network can serve as 1) a decision maker that decides when to retrieve, 2) a query rewriter to generate a query most suited to the retriever, and 3) an answer generator that produces the final response with/without the observations. We then propose to jointly optimize the whole system using a reinforcement learning algorithm, with the reward designed to encourage the system to achieve the best performance with minimal retrieval cost. When jointly optimized, all the modules can be aware of how other modules are working and thus find the best way to work together as a complete system. Empirical results demonstrate that the jointly optimized SmartRAG can achieve better performance than separately optimized counterparts.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution to enhance LLMs accuracy by incorporating external knowledge. However, traditional RAG systems struggle with processing complex relational information and multi-step reasoning, limiting their effectiveness in advanced problem-solving tasks. To address these limitations, we propose CogGRAG, a cognition inspired graph-based RAG framework, designed to improve LLMs performance in Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA). Inspired by the human cognitive process of decomposing complex problems and performing self-verification, our framework introduces a three-stage methodology: decomposition, retrieval, and reasoning with self-verification. By integrating these components, CogGRAG enhances the accuracy of LLMs in complex problem solving. We conduct systematic experiments with three LLM backbones on four benchmark datasets, where CogGRAG outperforms the baselines.</p></details> |  |

While RAG enhances MLLMs by grounding responses in query-relevant external knowledge, this reliance poses a critical yet underexplored safety risk: knowledge poisoning attacks, where misinformation or irrelevant knowledge is intentionally injected into external knowledge bases to manipulate model outputs to be incorrect and even harmful. To expose such vulnerabilities in multimodal RAG, we propose MM-PoisonRAG, a novel knowledge poisoning attack framework with two attack strategies: Localized Poisoning Attack (LPA), which injects query-specific misinformation in both text and images for targeted manipulation, and Globalized Poisoning Attack (GPA) to provide false guidance during MLLM generation to elicit nonsensical responses across all queries. We evaluate our attacks across multiple tasks, models, and access settings, demonstrating that LPA successfully manipulates the MLLM to generate attacker-controlled answers, with a success rate of up to 56% on MultiModalQA. Moreover, GPA completely disrupts model generation to 0% accuracy with just a single irrelevant knowledge injection. Our results highlight the urgent need for robust defenses against knowledge poisoning to safeguard multimodal RAG frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/HyeonjeongHa/MM-PoisonRAG</p></details> |

Although these speech act indicators communicate the user\textquotesingle s intent -- whether it is asking a question, making a request, or stating a fact -- they do not necessarily add to the core informational content of the query itself. This paper investigates whether extracting the underlying propositional content from user utterances -- essentially stripping away the linguistic markers of intent -- can improve retrieval quality in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Drawing upon foundational insights from speech act theory, we propose a practical method for automatically transforming queries into their propositional equivalents before embedding. To assess the efficacy of this approach, we conducted an experimental study involving 63 user queries related to a Brazilian telecommunications news corpus with precomputed semantic embeddings. Results demonstrate clear improvements in semantic similarity between query embeddings and document embeddings at top ranks, confirming that queries stripped of speech act indicators more effectively retrieve relevant content.</p></details> | 19 pages, 4 figures |

Built from heterologous data of NASDAQ 100 companies, FinTMMBench offers three significant advantages. 1) Multi-modal Corpus: It encompasses a hybrid of financial tables, news articles, daily stock prices, and visual technical charts as the corpus. 2) Temporal-aware Questions: Each question requires the retrieval and interpretation of its relevant data over a specific time period, including daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual periods. 3) Diverse Financial Analysis Tasks: The questions involve 10 different tasks, including information extraction, trend analysis, sentiment analysis and event detection, etc. We further propose a novel TMMHybridRAG method, which first leverages LLMs to convert data from other modalities (e.g., tabular, visual and time-series data) into textual format and then incorporates temporal information in each node when constructing graphs and dense indexes. Its effectiveness has been validated in extensive experiments, but notable gaps remain, highlighting the challenges presented by our FinTMMBench.</p></details> | Under review |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) fetches evidence via similarity search, but key information may fall outside top ranked results. Long-context models can process multiple documents but are computationally expensive and limited by context window size. Inspired by students condensing study material for open-book exams, we propose task-aware key-value (KV) cache compression, which compresses external knowledge in a zero- or few-shot setup. This enables LLMs to reason efficiently over a compacted representation of all relevant information. Experiments show our approach outperforms both RAG and task-agnostic compression methods. On LongBench v2, it improves accuracy by up to 7 absolute points over RAG with a 30x compression rate, while reducing inference latency from 0.43s to 0.16s. A synthetic dataset highlights that RAG performs well when sparse evidence suffices, whereas task-aware compression is superior for broad knowledge tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[More Documents, Same Length: Isolating the Challenge of Multiple Documents in RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04388v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) provides LLMs with relevant documents. Although previous studies noted that retrieving many documents can degrade performance, they did not isolate how the quantity of documents affects performance while controlling for context length. We evaluate various language models on custom datasets derived from a multi-hop QA task. We keep the context length and position of relevant information constant while varying the number of documents, and find that increasing the document count in RAG settings poses significant challenges for LLMs. Additionally, our results indicate that processing multiple documents is a separate challenge from handling long contexts. We also make the datasets and code available: https://github.com/shaharl6000/MoreDocsSameLen .</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[In-depth Analysis of Graph-based RAG in a Unified Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04338v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has proven effective in integrating external knowledge into large language models (LLMs), improving their factual accuracy, adaptability, interpretability, and trustworthiness. A number of graph-based RAG methods have been proposed in the literature. However, these methods have not been systematically and comprehensively compared under the same experimental settings. In this paper, we first summarize a unified framework to incorporate all graph-based RAG methods from a high-level perspective. We then extensively compare representative graph-based RAG methods over a range of questing-answering (QA) datasets -- from specific questions to abstract questions -- and examine the effectiveness of all methods, providing a thorough analysis of graph-based RAG approaches. As a byproduct of our experimental analysis, we are also able to identify new variants of the graph-based RAG methods over specific QA and abstract QA tasks respectively, by combining existing techniques, which outperform the state-of-the-art methods. Finally, based on these findings, we offer promising research opportunities. We believe that a deeper understanding of the behavior of existing methods can provide new valuable insights for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[LaRA: Benchmarking Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Long-Context LLMs -- No Silver Bullet for LC or RAG Routing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09977v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effectively incorporating external knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for enhancing their capabilities and addressing real-world needs. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers an effective method for achieving this by retrieving the most relevant fragments into LLMs. However, the advancements in context window size for LLMs offer an alternative approach, raising the question of whether RAG remains necessary for effectively handling external knowledge. Several existing studies provide inconclusive comparisons between RAG and long-context (LC) LLMs, largely due to limitations in the benchmark designs. In this paper, we present LaRA, a novel benchmark specifically designed to rigorously compare RAG and LC LLMs. LaRA encompasses 2326 test cases across four practical QA task categories and three types of naturally occurring long texts. Through systematic evaluation of seven open-source and four proprietary LLMs, we find that the optimal choice between RAG and LC depends on a complex interplay of factors, including the model's parameter size, long-text capabilities, context length, task type, and the characteristics of the retrieved chunks. Our findings provide actionable guidelines for practitioners to effectively leverage both RAG and LC approaches in developing and deploying LLM applications.

| **[RAGEval: Scenario Specific RAG Evaluation Dataset Generation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01262v5)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful approach that enables large language models (LLMs) to incorporate external knowledge. However, evaluating the effectiveness of RAG systems in specialized scenarios remains challenging due to the high costs of data construction and the lack of suitable evaluation metrics. This paper introduces RAGEval, a framework designed to assess RAG systems across diverse scenarios by generating high-quality documents, questions, answers, and references through a schema-based pipeline. With a focus on factual accuracy, we propose three novel metrics: Completeness, Hallucination, and Irrelevance to evaluate LLM generated responses rigorously. Experimental results show that RAGEval outperforms zero-shot and one-shot methods in terms of clarity, safety, conformity, and richness of generated samples. Furthermore, the use of LLMs for scoring the proposed metrics demonstrates a high level of consistency with human evaluations. RAGEval establishes a new paradigm for evaluating RAG systems in real-world applications. The code and dataset are released at https://github.com/OpenBMB/RAGEval.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/OpenBMB/RAGEval</p></details> |
| **[Retrieval-Augmented Perception: High-Resolution Image Perception Meets Visual RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01222v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-resolution (HR) image perception remains a key challenge in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To overcome the limitations of existing methods, this paper shifts away from prior dedicated heuristic approaches and revisits the most fundamental idea to HR perception by enhancing the long-context capability of MLLMs, driven by recent advances in long-context techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for general LLMs. Towards this end, this paper presents the first study exploring the use of RAG to address HR perception challenges. Specifically, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Perception (RAP), a training-free framework that retrieves and fuses relevant image crops while preserving spatial context using the proposed Spatial-Awareness Layout. To accommodate different tasks, the proposed Retrieved-Exploration Search (RE-Search) dynamically selects the optimal number of crops based on model confidence and retrieval scores. Experimental results on HR benchmarks demonstrate the significant effectiveness of RAP, with LLaVA-v1.5-13B achieving a 43% improvement on $V^*$ Bench and 19% on HR-Bench.</p></details> |  |
| **[MMed-RAG: Versatile Multimodal RAG System for Medical Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13085v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated significant potential in healthcare, particularly in disease diagnosis and treatment planning. Recent progress in Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) has opened up new possibilities for interactive diagnostic tools. However, these models often suffer from factual hallucination, which can lead to incorrect diagnoses. Fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have emerged as methods to address these issues. However, the amount of high-quality data and distribution shifts between training data and deployment data limit the application of fine-tuning methods. Although RAG is lightweight and effective, existing RAG-based approaches are not sufficiently general to different medical domains and can potentially cause misalignment issues, both between modalities and between the model and the ground truth. In this paper, we propose a versatile multimodal RAG system, MMed-RAG, designed to enhance the factuality of Med-LVLMs. Our approach introduces a domain-aware retrieval mechanism, an adaptive retrieved contexts selection method, and a provable RAG-based preference fine-tuning strategy. These innovations make the RAG process sufficiently general and reliable, significantly improving alignment when introducing retrieved contexts. Experimental results across five medical datasets (involving radiology, ophthalmology, pathology) on medical VQA and report generation demonstrate that MMed-RAG can achieve an average improvement of 43.8% in the factual accuracy of Med-LVLMs. Our data and code are available in https://github.com/richard-peng-xia/MMed-RAG.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
