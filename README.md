| **[SimuRA: Towards General Goal-Oriented Agent via Simulative Reasoning Architecture with LLM-Based World Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23773v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI agents built on large language models (LLMs) hold enormous promise, but current practice focuses on a one-task-one-agent approach, which not only falls short of scalability and generality, but also suffers from the fundamental limitations of autoregressive LLMs. On the other hand, humans are general agents who reason by mentally simulating the outcomes of their actions and plans. Moving towards a more general and powerful AI agent, we introduce SimuRA, a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning. Based on a principled formulation of optimal agent in any environment, \modelname overcomes the limitations of autoregressive reasoning by introducing a world model for planning via simulation. The generalized world model is implemented using LLM, which can flexibly plan in a wide range of environments using the concept-rich latent space of natural language. Experiments on difficult web browsing tasks show that \modelname improves the success of flight search from 0\% to 32.2\%. World-model-based planning, in particular, shows consistent advantage of up to 124\% over autoregressive planning, demonstrating the advantage of world model simulation as a reasoning paradigm. We are excited about the possibility for training a single, general agent model based on LLMs that can act superintelligently in all environments. To start, we make SimuRA, a web-browsing agent built on \modelname with pretrained LLMs, available as a research demo for public testing.</p></details> |  |
| **[SeqAffordSplat: Scene-level Sequential Affordance Reasoning on 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23772v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D affordance reasoning, the task of associating human instructions with the functional regions of 3D objects, is a critical capability for embodied agents. Current methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) are fundamentally limited to single-object, single-step interactions, a paradigm that falls short of addressing the long-horizon, multi-object tasks required for complex real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce the novel task of Sequential 3D Gaussian Affordance Reasoning and establish SeqAffordSplat, a large-scale benchmark featuring 1800+ scenes to support research on long-horizon affordance understanding in complex 3DGS environments. We then propose SeqSplatNet, an end-to-end framework that directly maps an instruction to a sequence of 3D affordance masks. SeqSplatNet employs a large language model that autoregressively generates text interleaved with special segmentation tokens, guiding a conditional decoder to produce the corresponding 3D mask. To handle complex scene geometry, we introduce a pre-training strategy, Conditional Geometric Reconstruction, where the model learns to reconstruct complete affordance region masks from known geometric observations, thereby building a robust geometric prior. Furthermore, to resolve semantic ambiguities, we design a feature injection mechanism that lifts rich semantic features from 2D Vision Foundation Models (VFM) and fuses them into the 3D decoder at multiple scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets a new state-of-the-art on our challenging benchmark, effectively advancing affordance reasoning from single-step interactions to complex, sequential tasks at the scene level.</p></details> |  |
| **[Perception-Aware Policy Optimization for Multimodal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06448v3)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven to be a highly effective strategy for endowing Large Language Models (LLMs) with robust multi-step reasoning abilities. However, its design and optimizations remain tailored to purely textual domains, resulting in suboptimal performance when applied to multimodal reasoning tasks. In particular, we observe that a major source of error in current multimodal reasoning lies in the perception of visual inputs. To address this bottleneck, we propose PAPO, a novel policy gradient algorithm that encourages the model to learn to perceive while learning to reason. Specifically, we introduce the Implicit Perception Loss in the form of a KL divergence term, which can be seamlessly plugged into mainstream RLVR algorithms such as GRPO and DAPO. Notably, PAPO does not rely on additional data curation, reward models, or stronger teacher models. To further enhance the training stability of PAPO, we introduce the Double Entropy Loss, which effectively regularizes the new KL objective without compromising performance. Despite its simplicity, PAPO yields significant overall improvements of 4.4%-17.5% on diverse multimodal benchmarks. The improvements are more pronounced, approaching 8.0%-19.1%, on tasks with high vision dependency. We also observe a substantial reduction of 30.5% in perception errors, indicating improved perceptual capabilities with PAPO. Overall, our work introduces a deeper integration of perception-aware supervision into core learning objectives and lays the groundwork for a new RL framework that encourages visually grounded reasoning. Code and data will be made publicly available for research purposes. Project page: https://mikewangwzhl.github.io/PAPO.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rule2Text: Natural Language Explanation of Logical Rules in Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23740v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graphs (KGs) often contain sufficient information to support the inference of new facts. Identifying logical rules not only improves the completeness of a knowledge graph but also enables the detection of potential errors, reveals subtle data patterns, and enhances the overall capacity for reasoning and interpretation. However, the complexity of such rules, combined with the unique labeling conventions of each KG, can make them difficult for humans to understand. In this paper, we explore the potential of large language models to generate natural language explanations for logical rules. Specifically, we extract logical rules using the AMIE 3.5.1 rule discovery algorithm from the benchmark dataset FB15k-237 and two large-scale datasets, FB-CVT-REV and FB+CVT-REV. We examine various prompting strategies, including zero- and few-shot prompting, including variable entity types, and chain-of-thought reasoning. We conduct a comprehensive human evaluation of the generated explanations based on correctness, clarity, and hallucination, and also assess the use of large language models as automatic judges. Our results demonstrate promising performance in terms of explanation correctness and clarity, although several challenges remain for future research. All scripts and data used in this study are publicly available at https://github.com/idirlab/KGRule2NL}{https://github.com/idirlab/KGRule2NL.</p></details> |  |
| **[How AI Ideas Affect the Creativity, Diversity, and Evolution of Human Ideas: Evidence From a Large, Dynamic Experiment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13481v3)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exposure to large language model output is rapidly increasing. How will seeing AI-generated ideas affect human ideas? We conducted an experiment (800+ participants, 40+ countries) where participants viewed creative ideas that were from ChatGPT or prior experimental participants and then brainstormed their own idea. We varied the number of AI-generated examples (none, low, or high exposure) and if the examples were labeled as 'AI' (disclosure). Our dynamic experiment design -- ideas from prior participants in an experimental condition are used as stimuli for future participants in the same experimental condition -- speaks to the interdependent process of cultural creation: creative ideas are built upon prior ideas. Hence, we capture the compounding effects of having LLMs 'in the culture loop'. We find that high AI exposure (but not low AI exposure) did not affect the creativity of individual ideas but did increase the average amount and rate of change of collective idea diversity. AI made ideas different, not better. There were no main effects of disclosure. We also found that self-reported creative people were less influenced by knowing an idea was from AI and that participants may knowingly adopt AI ideas when the task is difficult. Our findings suggest that introducing AI ideas may increase collective diversity but not individual creativity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACM Collective Intelligence 2025.

| **[DICOM De-Identification via Hybrid AI and Rule-Based Framework for Scalable, Uncertainty-Aware Redaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23736v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Access to medical imaging and associated text data has the potential to drive major advances in healthcare research and patient outcomes. However, the presence of Protected Health Information (PHI) and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) files presents a significant barrier to the ethical and secure sharing of imaging datasets. This paper presents a hybrid de-identification framework developed by Impact Business Information Solutions (IBIS) that combines rule-based and AI-driven techniques, and rigorous uncertainty quantification for comprehensive PHI/PII removal from both metadata and pixel data. Our approach begins with a two-tiered rule-based system targeting explicit and inferred metadata elements, further augmented by a large language model (LLM) fine-tuned for Named Entity Recognition (NER), and trained on a suite of synthetic datasets simulating realistic clinical PHI/PII. For pixel data, we employ an uncertainty-aware Faster R-CNN model to localize embedded text, extract candidate PHI via Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and apply the NER pipeline for final redaction. Crucially, uncertainty quantification provides confidence measures for AI-based detections to enhance automation reliability and enable informed human-in-the-loop verification to manage residual risks. This uncertainty-aware deidentification framework achieves robust performance across benchmark datasets and regulatory standards, including DICOM, HIPAA, and TCIA compliance metrics. By combining scalable automation, uncertainty quantification, and rigorous quality assurance, our solution addresses critical challenges in medical data de-identification and supports the secure, ethical, and trustworthy release of imaging data for research.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures, |
| **[Distributed AI Agents for Cognitive Underwater Robot Autonomy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23735v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving robust cognitive autonomy in robots navigating complex, unpredictable environments remains a fundamental challenge in robotics. This paper presents Underwater Robot Self-Organizing Autonomy (UROSA), a groundbreaking architecture leveraging distributed Large Language Model AI agents integrated within the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) framework to enable advanced cognitive capabilities in Autonomous Underwater Vehicles. UROSA decentralises cognition into specialised AI agents responsible for multimodal perception, adaptive reasoning, dynamic mission planning, and real-time decision-making. Central innovations include flexible agents dynamically adapting their roles, retrieval-augmented generation utilising vector databases for efficient knowledge management, reinforcement learning-driven behavioural optimisation, and autonomous on-the-fly ROS 2 node generation for runtime functional extensibility. Extensive empirical validation demonstrates UROSA's promising adaptability and reliability through realistic underwater missions in simulation and real-world deployments, showing significant advantages over traditional rule-based architectures in handling unforeseen scenarios, environmental uncertainties, and novel mission objectives. This work not only advances underwater autonomy but also establishes a scalable, safe, and versatile cognitive robotics framework capable of generalising to a diverse array of real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[RecGPT Technical Report](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22879v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems are among the most impactful applications of artificial intelligence, serving as critical infrastructure connecting users, merchants, and platforms. However, most current industrial systems remain heavily reliant on historical co-occurrence patterns and log-fitting objectives, i.e., optimizing for past user interactions without explicitly modeling user intent. This log-fitting approach often leads to overfitting to narrow historical preferences, failing to capture users' evolving and latent interests. As a result, it reinforces filter bubbles and long-tail phenomena, ultimately harming user experience and threatening the sustainability of the whole recommendation ecosystem. To address these challenges, we rethink the overall design paradigm of recommender systems and propose RecGPT, a next-generation framework that places user intent at the center of the recommendation pipeline. By integrating large language models (LLMs) into key stages of user interest mining, item retrieval, and explanation generation, RecGPT transforms log-fitting recommendation into an intent-centric process. To effectively align general-purpose LLMs to the above domain-specific recommendation tasks at scale, RecGPT incorporates a multi-stage training paradigm, which integrates reasoning-enhanced pre-alignment and self-training evolution, guided by a Human-LLM cooperative judge system. Currently, RecGPT has been fully deployed on the Taobao App. Online experiments demonstrate that RecGPT achieves consistent performance gains across stakeholders: users benefit from increased content diversity and satisfaction, merchants and the platform gain greater exposure and conversions. These comprehensive improvement results across all stakeholders validates that LLM-driven, intent-centric design can foster a more sustainable and mutually beneficial recommendation ecosystem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unable to Forget: Proactive Interference Reveals Working Memory Limits in LLMs Beyond Context Length](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08184v3)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Information retrieval in Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly recognized as intertwined with generation capabilities rather than mere lookup. While longer contexts are often assumed to improve retrieval, the effects of intra-context interference remain understudied. To address this, we adapt the proactive interference (PI) paradigm from cognitive science, where earlier information disrupts recall of newer updates. In humans, susceptibility to such interference is inversely linked to working memory capacity. We introduce PI-LLM, an evaluation that sequentially streams semantically related key-value updates and queries only the final values. Although these final values are clearly positioned just before the query, LLM retrieval accuracy declines log-linearly toward zero as interference accumulates; errors arise from retrieving previously overwritten values. Attempts to mitigate interference via prompt engineering (e.g., instructing models to ignore earlier input) yield limited success. These findings reveal a fundamental constraint on LLMs' ability to disentangle interference and flexibly manipulate information, suggesting a working memory bottleneck beyond mere context access. This calls for approaches that strengthen models' ability to suppress irrelevant content during retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025 Workshop on Long Context Foundation Models (ICFM).

| **[A survey of multi-agent geosimulation methodologies: from ABM to LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23694v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We provide a comprehensive examination of agent-based approaches that codify the principles and linkages underlying multi-agent systems, simulations, and information systems. Based on two decades of study, this paper confirms a framework intended as a formal specification for geosimulation platforms. Our findings show that large language models (LLMs) can be effectively incorporated as agent components if they follow a structured architecture specific to fundamental agent activities such as perception, memory, planning, and action. This integration is precisely consistent with the architecture that we formalize, providing a solid platform for next-generation geosimulation systems.</p></details> | 20 pages, 1 table |
| **[DepMicroDiff: Diffusion-Based Dependency-Aware Multimodal Imputation for Microbiome Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23676v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Microbiome data analysis is essential for understanding host health and disease, yet its inherent sparsity and noise pose major challenges for accurate imputation, hindering downstream tasks such as biomarker discovery. Existing imputation methods, including recent diffusion-based models, often fail to capture the complex interdependencies between microbial taxa and overlook contextual metadata that can inform imputation. We introduce DepMicroDiff, a novel framework that combines diffusion-based generative modeling with a Dependency-Aware Transformer (DAT) to explicitly capture both mutual pairwise dependencies and autoregressive relationships. DepMicroDiff is further enhanced by VAE-based pretraining across diverse cancer datasets and conditioning on patient metadata encoded via a large language model (LLM). Experiments on TCGA microbiome datasets show that DepMicroDiff substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher Pearson correlation (up to 0.712), cosine similarity (up to 0.812), and lower RMSE and MAE across multiple cancer types, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability for microbiome imputation.</p></details> |  |
| **[TweakLLM: A Routing Architecture for Dynamic Tailoring of Cached Responses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23674v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) process millions of queries daily, making efficient response caching a compelling optimization for reducing cost and latency. However, preserving relevance to user queries using this approach proves difficult due to the personalized nature of chatbot interactions and the limited accuracy of semantic similarity search. To address this, we present TweakLLM, a novel routing architecture that employs a lightweight LLM to dynamically adapt cached responses to incoming prompts. Through comprehensive evaluation, including user studies with side-by-side comparisons, satisfaction voting, as well as multi-agent LLM debates, we demonstrate that TweakLLM maintains response quality comparable to frontier models while significantly improving cache effectiveness. Our results across real-world datasets highlight TweakLLM as a scalable, resource-efficient caching solution for high-volume LLM deployments without compromising user experience.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |
| **[White-Basilisk: A Hybrid Model for Code Vulnerability Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08540v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of software vulnerabilities presents a significant challenge to cybersecurity, necessitating more effective detection methodologies. We introduce White-Basilisk, a novel approach to vulnerability detection that demonstrates superior performance while challenging prevailing assumptions in AI model scaling. Utilizing an innovative architecture that integrates Mamba layers, linear self-attention, and a Mixture of Experts framework, White-Basilisk achieves state-of-the-art results in vulnerability detection tasks with a parameter count of only 200M. The model's capacity to process sequences of unprecedented length enables comprehensive analysis of extensive codebases in a single pass, surpassing the context limitations of current Large Language Models (LLMs). White-Basilisk exhibits robust performance on imbalanced, real-world datasets, while maintaining computational efficiency that facilitates deployment across diverse organizational scales. This research not only establishes new benchmarks in code security but also provides empirical evidence that compact, efficiently designed models can outperform larger counterparts in specialized tasks, potentially redefining optimization strategies in AI development for domain-specific applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Who's important? -- SUnSET: Synergistic Understanding of Stakeholder, Events and Time for Timeline Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21903v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As news reporting becomes increasingly global and decentralized online, tracking related events across multiple sources presents significant challenges. Existing news summarization methods typically utilizes Large Language Models and Graphical methods on article-based summaries. However, this is not effective since it only considers the textual content of similarly dated articles to understand the gist of the event. To counteract the lack of analysis on the parties involved, it is essential to come up with a novel framework to gauge the importance of stakeholders and the connection of related events through the relevant entities involved. Therefore, we present SUnSET: Synergistic Understanding of Stakeholder, Events and Time for the task of Timeline Summarization (TLS). We leverage powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) to build SET triplets and introduced the use of stakeholder-based ranking to construct a $Relevancy$ metric, which can be extended into general situations. Our experimental results outperform all prior baselines and emerged as the new State-of-the-Art, highlighting the impact of stakeholder information within news article.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Can I Publish My LLM Benchmark Without Giving the True Answers Away?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18102v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Publishing a large language model (LLM) benchmark on the Internet risks contaminating future LLMs: the benchmark may be unintentionally (or intentionally) used to train or select a model. A common mitigation is to keep the benchmark private and let participants submit their models or predictions to the organizers. However, this strategy will require trust in a single organization and still permits test-set overfitting through repeated queries. To overcome this issue, we propose a way to publish benchmarks without completely disclosing the ground-truth answers to the questions, while still maintaining the ability to openly evaluate LLMs. Our main idea is to inject randomness to the answers by preparing several logically correct answers, and only include one of them as the solution in the benchmark. This reduces the best possible accuracy, i.e., Bayes accuracy, of the benchmark. Not only is this helpful to keep us from disclosing the ground truth, but this approach also offers a test for detecting data contamination. In principle, even fully capable models should not surpass the Bayes accuracy. If a model surpasses this ceiling despite this expectation, this is a strong signal of data contamination. We present experimental evidence that our method can detect data contamination accurately on a wide range of benchmarks, models, and training methodologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of the paper presented as an Oral at the ICML 2025 Workshop on the Impact of Memorization on Trustworthy Foundation Models</p></details> |
| **[MemoCue: Empowering LLM-Based Agents for Human Memory Recall via Strategy-Guided Querying](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23633v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agent-assisted memory recall is one critical research problem in the field of human-computer interaction. In conventional methods, the agent can retrieve information from its equipped memory module to help the person recall incomplete or vague memories. The limited size of memory module hinders the acquisition of complete memories and impacts the memory recall performance in practice. Memory theories suggest that the person's relevant memory can be proactively activated through some effective cues. Inspired by this, we propose a novel strategy-guided agent-assisted memory recall method, allowing the agent to transform an original query into a cue-rich one via the judiciously designed strategy to help the person recall memories. To this end, there are two key challenges. (1) How to choose the appropriate recall strategy for diverse forgetting scenarios with distinct memory-recall characteristics? (2) How to obtain the high-quality responses leveraging recall strategies, given only abstract and sparsely annotated strategy patterns? To address the challenges, we propose a Recall Router framework. Specifically, we design a 5W Recall Map to classify memory queries into five typical scenarios and define fifteen recall strategy patterns across the corresponding scenarios. We then propose a hierarchical recall tree combined with the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to optimize the selection of strategy and the generation of strategy responses. We construct an instruction tuning dataset and fine-tune multiple open-source large language models (LLMs) to develop MemoCue, an agent that excels in providing memory-inspired responses. Experiments on three representative datasets show that MemoCue surpasses LLM-based methods by 17.74% in recall inspiration. Further human evaluation highlights its advantages in memory-recall applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Based Identification of Infostealer Infection Vectors from Screenshots: The Case of Aurora](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23611v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infostealers exfiltrate credentials, session cookies, and sensitive data from infected systems. With over 29 million stealer logs reported in 2024, manual analysis and mitigation at scale are virtually unfeasible/unpractical. While most research focuses on proactive malware detection, a significant gap remains in leveraging reactive analysis of stealer logs and their associated artifacts. Specifically, infection artifacts such as screenshots, image captured at the point of compromise, are largely overlooked by the current literature. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), more specifically gpt-4o-mini, to analyze infection screenshots to extract potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), map infection vectors, and track campaigns. Focusing on the Aurora infostealer, we demonstrate how LLMs can process screenshots to identify infection vectors, such as malicious URLs, installer files, and exploited software themes. Our method extracted 337 actionable URLs and 246 relevant files from 1000 screenshots, revealing key malware distribution methods and social engineering tactics. By correlating extracted filenames, URLs, and infection themes, we identified three distinct malware campaigns, demonstrating the potential of LLM-driven analysis for uncovering infection workflows and enhancing threat intelligence. By shifting malware analysis from traditional log-based detection methods to a reactive, artifact-driven approach that leverages infection screenshots, this research presents a scalable method for identifying infection vectors and enabling early intervention.</p></details> |  |
| **[Medical Image De-Identification Benchmark Challenge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23608v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The de-identification (deID) of protected health information (PHI) and personally identifiable information (PII) is a fundamental requirement for sharing medical images, particularly through public repositories, to ensure compliance with patient privacy laws. In addition, preservation of non-PHI metadata to inform and enable downstream development of imaging artificial intelligence (AI) is an important consideration in biomedical research. The goal of MIDI-B was to provide a standardized platform for benchmarking of DICOM image deID tools based on a set of rules conformant to the HIPAA Safe Harbor regulation, the DICOM Attribute Confidentiality Profiles, and best practices in preservation of research-critical metadata, as defined by The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). The challenge employed a large, diverse, multi-center, and multi-modality set of real de-identified radiology images with synthetic PHI/PII inserted. The MIDI-B Challenge consisted of three phases: training, validation, and test. Eighty individuals registered for the challenge. In the training phase, we encouraged participants to tune their algorithms using their in-house or public data. The validation and test phases utilized the DICOM images containing synthetic identifiers (of 216 and 322 subjects, respectively). Ten teams successfully completed the test phase of the challenge. To measure success of a rule-based approach to image deID, scores were computed as the percentage of correct actions from the total number of required actions. The scores ranged from 97.91% to 99.93%. Participants employed a variety of open-source and proprietary tools with customized configurations, large language models, and optical character recognition (OCR). In this paper we provide a comprehensive report on the MIDI-B Challenge's design, implementation, results, and lessons learned.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[Inside-Out: Hidden Factual Knowledge in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15299v3)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a framework for assessing whether large language models (LLMs) encode more factual knowledge in their parameters than what they express in their outputs. While a few studies hint at this possibility, none has clearly defined or demonstrated this phenomenon. We first propose a formal definition of knowledge, quantifying it for a given question as the fraction of correct-incorrect answer pairs where the correct one is ranked higher. This gives rise to external and internal knowledge, depending on the information used to score individual answer candidates: either the model's observable token-level probabilities or its intermediate computations. Hidden knowledge arises when internal knowledge exceeds external knowledge. We then present a case study, applying this framework to three popular open-weights LLMs in a closed-book QA setup. Our results indicate that: (1) LLMs consistently encode more factual knowledge internally than what they express externally, with an average relative gap of 40%. (2) Surprisingly, some knowledge is so deeply hidden that a model can internally know an answer perfectly, yet fail to generate it even once, despite large-scale repeated sampling of 1,000 answers. This reveals fundamental limitations in the generation capabilities of LLMs, which (3) put a practical constraint on scaling test-time compute via repeated answer sampling in closed-book QA: significant performance improvements remain inaccessible because some answers are practically never sampled, yet if they were, we would be guaranteed to rank them first.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLM 2025</p></details> |

However, code review requires experienced developers who may not always have the time to perform an in-depth review of code. Thus, automating code review can help alleviate the cognitive burden on experienced software developers allowing them to focus on their primary activities of writing code to add new features and fix bugs. In this paper, we describe our experience in using Large Language Models towards automating the code review process in Ericsson. We describe the development of a lightweight tool using LLMs and static program analysis. We then describe our preliminary experiments with experienced developers in evaluating our code review tool and the encouraging results.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 1 table.

| **[Can LLM-Reasoning Models Replace Classical Planning? A Benchmark Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23589v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models have sparked interest in their potential for robotic task planning. While these models demonstrate strong generative capabilities, their effectiveness in producing structured and executable plans remains uncertain. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of a broad spectrum of current state of the art language models, each directly prompted using Planning Domain Definition Language domain and problem files, and compares their planning performance with the Fast Downward planner across a variety of benchmarks. In addition to measuring success rates, we assess how faithfully the generated plans translate into sequences of actions that can actually be executed, identifying both strengths and limitations of using these models in this setting. Our findings show that while the models perform well on simpler planning tasks, they continue to struggle with more complex scenarios that require precise resource management, consistent state tracking, and strict constraint compliance. These results underscore fundamental challenges in applying language models to robotic planning in real world environments. By outlining the gaps that emerge during execution, we aim to guide future research toward combined approaches that integrate language models with classical planners in order to enhance the reliability and scalability of planning in autonomous robotics.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce DiffLoRA, a parameter-efficient adaptation of the differential attention mechanism, with low-rank adapters on both positive and negative attention terms. This approach retains the efficiency of LoRA while aiming to benefit from the performance gains of differential attention. We evaluate DiffLoRA across a broad range of NLP tasks, including general benchmarks, many-shot in-context learning, RAG, and long-context tests. We observe that, although DiffLoRA falls short of other parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods in most evaluation tasks, it shows interesting results in certain domains (+11 pts on LoRA for HumanEval). We analyze the attention patterns post-finetuning to identify the reasons for this behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Where Paths Collide: A Comprehensive Survey of Classic and Learning-Based Multi-Agent Pathfinding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19219v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence and robotics, requiring the computation of collision-free paths for multiple agents navigating from their start locations to designated goals. As autonomous systems become increasingly prevalent in warehouses, urban transportation, and other complex environments, MAPF has evolved from a theoretical challenge to a critical enabler of real-world multi-robot coordination. This comprehensive survey bridges the long-standing divide between classical algorithmic approaches and emerging learning-based methods in MAPF research. We present a unified framework that encompasses search-based methods (including Conflict-Based Search, Priority-Based Search, and Large Neighborhood Search), compilation-based approaches (SAT, SMT, CSP, ASP, and MIP formulations), and data-driven techniques (reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and hybrid strategies). Through systematic analysis of experimental practices across 200+ papers, we uncover significant disparities in evaluation methodologies, with classical methods typically tested on larger-scale instances (up to 200 by 200 grids with 1000+ agents) compared to learning-based approaches (predominantly 10-100 agents). We provide a comprehensive taxonomy of evaluation metrics, environment types, and baseline selections, highlighting the need for standardized benchmarking protocols. Finally, we outline promising future directions including mixed-motive MAPF with game-theoretic considerations, language-grounded planning with large language models, and neural solver architectures that combine the rigor of classical methods with the flexibility of deep learning.

To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{BeyondGloss}, a novel gloss-free SLT framework that leverages the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs). Since existing VideoLLMs struggle to model long videos in detail, we propose a novel approach to generate fine-grained, temporally-aware textual descriptions of hand motion. A contrastive alignment module aligns these descriptions with video features during pre-training, encouraging the model to focus on hand-centric temporal dynamics and distinguish signs more effectively. To further enrich hand-specific representations, we distill fine-grained features from HaMeR. Additionally, we apply a contrastive loss between sign video representations and target language embeddings to reduce the modality gap in pre-training. \textbf{BeyondGloss} achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Phoenix14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework. We will release the code upon acceptance of the paper.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at BMVC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Neutral Residues: Revisiting Adapters for Model Extension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02744v3)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of extending a pretrained large language model to a new domain that was not seen during training. Standard techniques, such as finetuning or low-rank adaptation (LoRA) are successful at domain adaptation, but do not formally add capacity to the model. This often leads to a trade-off, between performing well on the new domain vs. degrading performance on the original domain. Here, we revisit and improve adapters to extend LLMs from three angles: data, architecture and training procedure, which are advantageously considered jointly. The resulting method, called neutral residues, modifies adapters in a way that leads each new residual block to output near-zeros on the original domain. This solution leads to strong results when adapting a state-of-the-art model originally trained on English to a new language. Neutral residues significantly outperform competing approaches such as finetuning, LoRA or vanilla adapters in terms of the trade-off between learning the new language and not forgetting English.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025</p></details> |

However, their effectiveness remains constrained when reasoning extends beyond the knowledge acquired during pretraining. Conventional approaches, such as fine-tuning or retrieval-augmented generation, face limitations in either imposing high computational overhead or failing to fully exploit structured scientific data. To overcome these challenges, we propose DrugMCTS, a novel framework that synergistically integrates RAG, multi-agent collaboration, and Monte Carlo Tree Search for drug repositioning. The framework employs five specialized agents tasked with retrieving and analyzing molecular and protein information, thereby enabling structured and iterative reasoning. Extensive experiments on the DrugBank and KIBA datasets demonstrate that DrugMCTS achieves substantially higher recall and robustness compared to both general-purpose LLMs and deep learning baselines. Our results highlight the importance of structured reasoning, agent-based collaboration, and feedback-driven search mechanisms in advancing LLM applications for drug repositioning.</p></details> |  |

However, existing works have shown that the effectiveness of ICL is highly sensitive to the choice of demonstrations, with suboptimal examples often leading to unstable or degraded performance. While prior work has explored example selection, including in some agentic or multi-step settings, existing approaches typically rely on heuristics or task-specific designs and lack a general, theoretically grounded criterion for what constitutes an effective demonstration across reasoning steps. Therefore, it is non-trivial to develop a principled, general-purpose method for selecting demonstrations that consistently benefit agent performance. In this paper, we address this challenge with DICE, Dynamic In-Context Example Selection for LLM Agents, a theoretically grounded ICL framework for agentic tasks that selects the most relevant demonstrations at each step of reasoning. Our approach decomposes demonstration knowledge into transferable and non-transferable components through a causal lens, showing how the latter can introduce spurious dependencies that impair generalization. We further propose a stepwise selection criterion with a formal guarantee of improved agent performance. Importantly, DICE is a general, framework-agnostic solution that can be integrated as a plug-in module into existing agentic frameworks without any additional training cost. Extensive experiments across diverse domains demonstrate our method's effectiveness and generality, highlighting the importance of principled, context-aware demo selection for robust and efficient LLM agents.</p></details> |  |

A Quantitative Evaluation of various Large Language Models on Word Sense Disambiguation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18337v4)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ambiguous words are often found in modern digital communications. Lexical ambiguity challenges traditional Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) methods, due to limited data. Consequently, the efficiency of translation, information retrieval, and question-answering systems is hindered by these limitations. This study investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve WSD using a novel approach combining a systematic prompt augmentation mechanism with a knowledge base (KB) consisting of different sense interpretations. The proposed method incorporates a human-in-loop approach for prompt augmentation where prompt is supported by Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, synonyms of ambiguous words, aspect-based sense filtering and few-shot prompting to guide the LLM. By utilizing a few-shot Chain of Thought (COT) prompting-based approach, this work demonstrates a substantial improvement in performance. The evaluation was conducted using FEWS test data and sense tags. This research advances accurate word interpretation in social media and digital communication.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages,6 tables, 1 figure, Proceedings of the 1st International Conference on NLP & AI for Cyber Security</p></details> |

These challenges stem from fragmented architectures, limited generalization to novel scenarios, and insufficient semantic extraction from perception. To address these limitations, we propose a unified Perception-Language-Action (PLA) framework that integrates multi-sensor fusion (cameras, LiDAR, radar) with a large language model (LLM)-augmented Vision-Language-Action (VLA) architecture, specifically a GPT-4.1-powered reasoning core. This framework unifies low-level sensory processing with high-level contextual reasoning, tightly coupling perception with natural language-based semantic understanding and decision-making to enable context-aware, explainable, and safety-bounded autonomous driving. Evaluations on an urban intersection scenario with a construction zone demonstrate superior performance in trajectory tracking, speed prediction, and adaptive planning. The results highlight the potential of language-augmented cognitive frameworks for advancing the safety, interpretability, and scalability of autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[MolParser: End-to-end Visual Recognition of Molecule Structures in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11098v3)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent decades, chemistry publications and patents have increased rapidly. A significant portion of key information is embedded in molecular structure figures, complicating large-scale literature searches and limiting the application of large language models in fields such as biology, chemistry, and pharmaceuticals. The automatic extraction of precise chemical structures is of critical importance. However, the presence of numerous Markush structures in real-world documents, along with variations in molecular image quality, drawing styles, and noise, significantly limits the performance of existing optical chemical structure recognition (OCSR) methods. We present MolParser, a novel end-to-end OCSR method that efficiently and accurately recognizes chemical structures from real-world documents, including difficult Markush structure. We use a extended SMILES encoding rule to annotate our training dataset. Under this rule, we build MolParser-7M, the largest annotated molecular image dataset to our knowledge. While utilizing a large amount of synthetic data, we employed active learning methods to incorporate substantial in-the-wild data, specifically samples cropped from real patents and scientific literature, into the training process. We trained an end-to-end molecular image captioning model, MolParser, using a curriculum learning approach. MolParser significantly outperforms classical and learning-based methods across most scenarios, with potential for broader downstream applications. The dataset is publicly available in huggingface.</p></details> |  |

While extensively researched in large language models (LLMs), their application to smaller models used on edge devices, such as convolutional neural networks, remains underexplored. This paper benchmarks and analyzes popular PEFT methods on convolutional architectures typically deployed in resource-constrained edge environments. We evaluate LoRA, DoRA, and GaLore for updating standard and depthwise convolutional architectures to handle distribution shifts and accommodate unseen classes. We utilize recently proposed PyTorch profilers to compare the updated model performance and computational costs of these PEFT methods with traditional fine-tuning approaches. With resource efficiency in mind, we investigate their update behavior across different rank dimensions. We find that the evaluated PEFT methods are only half as memory-efficient when applied to depthwise-separable convolution architectures, compared to their efficiency with LLMs. Conversely, when targeting convolu- tional architectures optimized for edge deployment, adapter-based PEFT methods can reduce floating point operations (FLOPs) during model updates by up to 95%. These insights offer valuable guidance for selecting PEFT methods based on hardware constraints, performance requirements, and application needs. Our code is online.</p></details> |  |

While discriminative Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) excels in high-level semantics, it struggles with perceiving fine-grained visual details. Generally, to enhance representations, generative models take CLIP's visual features as conditions for reconstruction. However, the underlying principle remains underexplored. In this work, we empirically found that visually perfect generations are not always optimal for representation enhancement. The essence lies in effectively extracting fine-grained knowledge from generative models while mitigating irrelevant information. To explore critical factors, we delve into three aspects: (1) Conditioning mechanisms: We found that even a small number of local tokens can drastically reduce the difficulty of reconstruction, leading to collapsed training. We thus conclude that utilizing only global visual tokens as conditions is the most effective strategy. (2) Denoising configurations: We observed that end-to-end training introduces extraneous information. To address this, we propose a two-stage training strategy to prioritize learning useful visual knowledge. Additionally, we demonstrate that lightweight denoisers can yield remarkable improvements. (3) Generation paradigms: We explore both continuous and discrete denoisers with desirable outcomes, validating the versatility of our method. Through our in-depth explorations, we have finally arrived at an effective method, namely GenHancer, which consistently outperforms prior arts on the MMVP-VLM benchmark, e.g., 6.0% on OpenAICLIP. The enhanced CLIP can be further plugged into multimodal large language models for better vision-centric performance.

Recently, diffusion-based language models have emerged as a promising alternative, though their advantages over AR models remain underexplored. In this paper, we systematically study masked diffusion models in data-constrained settings-where training involves repeated passes over limited data-and find that they significantly outperform AR models when compute is abundant but data is scarce. Diffusion models make better use of repeated data, achieving lower validation loss and superior downstream performance. We interpret this advantage as implicit data augmentation: masked diffusion exposes the model to a diverse distribution of token orderings and prediction tasks, unlike AR's fixed left-to-right factorization. We find new scaling laws for diffusion models and derive a closed-form expression for the critical compute threshold at which diffusion begins to outperform AR. These results suggest that when data, not compute, is the bottleneck, diffusion models offer a compelling alternative to the standard AR paradigm.

It is also a crucial component of Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms. However, existing high-probability convergence analyses typically require the clipping threshold to increase with the number of optimization steps, which is incompatible with standard DP mechanisms like the Gaussian mechanism. In this work, we close this gap by providing the first high-probability convergence analysis for DP-Clipped-SGD with a fixed clipping level, applicable to both convex and non-convex smooth optimization under heavy-tailed noise, characterized by a bounded central $\alpha$-th moment assumption, $\alpha \in (1,2]$. Our results show that, with a fixed clipping level, the method converges to a neighborhood of the optimal solution with a faster rate than the existing ones. The neighborhood can be balanced against the noise introduced by DP, providing a refined trade-off between convergence speed and privacy guarantees.</p></details> | 60 pages |

This gap persists largely because current benchmarks, limited by data annotations and evaluation metrics, fail to reliably distinguish between generic and highly detailed model outputs. To this end, this work introduces MECAT, a Multi-Expert Constructed Benchmark for Fine-Grained Audio Understanding Tasks. Generated via a pipeline that integrates analysis from specialized expert models with Chain-of-Thought large language model reasoning, MECAT provides multi-perspective, fine-grained captions and open-set question-answering pairs. The benchmark is complemented by a novel metric: DATE (Discriminative-Enhanced Audio Text Evaluation). This metric penalizes generic terms and rewards detailed descriptions by combining single-sample semantic similarity with cross-sample discriminability. A comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art audio models is also presented, providing new insights into their current capabilities and limitations.

While prior work has primarily focused on scaling these components to billions of parameters, the trade-offs between model size, architecture, and performance remain underexplored. Additionally, inconsistencies in training data and evaluation protocols have hindered direct comparisons, making it difficult to derive optimal design choices. In this paper, we introduce LLaVA-MORE, a new family of MLLMs that integrates recent language models with diverse visual backbones. To ensure fair comparisons, we employ a unified training protocol applied consistently across all architectures. Our analysis systematically explores both small- and medium-scale LLMs -- including Phi-4, LLaMA-3.1, and Gemma-2 -- to evaluate multimodal reasoning, generation, and instruction following, while examining the relationship between model size and performance. Beyond evaluating the LLM impact on final results, we conduct a comprehensive study of various visual encoders, ranging from CLIP-based architectures to alternatives such as DINOv2, SigLIP, and SigLIP2. Additional experiments investigate the effects of increased image resolution and variations in pre-training datasets. Overall, our results provide insights into the design of more effective MLLMs, offering a reproducible evaluation framework that facilitates direct comparisons and can guide future model development.

Nonetheless, FedLLMs remain vulnerable to model poisoning attacks. This article first reviews recent advancements in model poisoning techniques and existing defense mechanisms for FedLLMs, underscoring critical limitations, especially when dealing with non-IID textual data distributions. Current defense strategies predominantly employ distance or similarity-based outlier detection mechanisms, relying on the assumption that malicious updates markedly differ from benign statistical patterns. However, this assumption becomes inadequate against adaptive adversaries targeting billion-parameter LLMs. The article further investigates graph representation-based model poisoning (GRMP), an emerging attack paradigm that exploits higher-order correlations among benign client gradients to craft malicious updates indistinguishable from legitimate ones. GRMP can effectively circumvent advanced defense systems, causing substantial degradation in model accuracy and overall performance. Moreover, the article outlines a forward-looking research roadmap that emphasizes the necessity of graph-aware secure aggregation methods, specialized vulnerability metrics tailored for FedLLMs, and evaluation frameworks to enhance the robustness of federated language model deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures (Submitted to IEEE Communication Magazine)</p></details> |

Recent advances in internal reasoning with large language models have sparked interest in whether state-of-the-art reasoning models can robustly perform causal discovery-a task where conventional models often suffer from severe overfitting and near-random performance under data perturbations. We study causal discovery on the Corr2Cause benchmark using the emergent OpenAI's o-series and DeepSeek-R model families and find that these reasoning-first architectures achieve significantly greater native gains than prior approaches. To capitalize on these strengths, we introduce a modular in-context pipeline inspired by the Tree-of-Thoughts and Chain-of-Thoughts methodologies, yielding nearly three-fold improvements over conventional baselines. We further probe the pipeline's impact by analyzing reasoning chain length, complexity, and conducting qualitative and quantitative comparisons between conventional and reasoning models. Our findings suggest that while advanced reasoning models represent a substantial leap forward, carefully structured in-context frameworks are essential to maximize their capabilities and offer a generalizable blueprint for causal discovery across diverse domains.</p></details> |  |

We developed the Clinical Safety-Effectiveness Dual-Track Benchmark (CSEDB), a multidimensional framework built on clinical expert consensus, encompassing 30 criteria covering critical areas like critical illness recognition, guideline adherence, and medication safety, with weighted consequence measures. Thirty-two specialist physicians developed and reviewed 2,069 open-ended Q&A items aligned with these criteria, spanning 26 clinical departments to simulate real-world scenarios. Benchmark testing of six LLMs revealed moderate overall performance (average total score 57.2%, safety 54.7%, effectiveness 62.3%), with a significant 13.3% performance drop in high-risk scenarios (p < 0.0001). Domain-specific medical LLMs showed consistent performance advantages over general-purpose models, with relatively higher top scores in safety (0.912) and effectiveness (0.861). The findings of this study not only provide a standardized metric for evaluating the clinical application of medical LLMs, facilitating comparative analyses, risk exposure identification, and improvement directions across different scenarios, but also hold the potential to promote safer and more effective deployment of large language models in healthcare environments.</p></details> |  |

In response, detection methods have evolved from traditional approaches to multimodal large language models (MLLMs), offering enhanced transparency and interpretability in identifying synthetic media. However, current detection systems remain fundamentally limited by their single-modality design. These approaches analyze images or videos separately, making them ineffective against synthetic content that combines multiple media formats. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{BusterX++}, a novel framework designed specifically for cross-modal detection and explanation of synthetic media. Our approach incorporates an advanced reinforcement learning (RL) post-training strategy that eliminates cold-start. Through Multi-stage Training, Thinking Reward, and Hybrid Reasoning, BusterX++ achieves stable and substantial performance improvements. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we also present \textbf{GenBuster++}, a cross-modal benchmark leveraging state-of-the-art image and video generation techniques. This benchmark comprises 4,000 images and video clips, meticulously curated by human experts using a novel filtering methodology to ensure high quality, diversity, and real-world applicability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Several research works have explored new deepfake detection methods on AI-generated images to alleviate these risks. However, with the fast development of video generation models, such as Sora and WanX, there is currently a lack of large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video datasets for forgery detection. In addition, existing detection approaches predominantly treat the task as binary classification, lacking explainability in model decision-making and failing to provide actionable insights or guidance for the public. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{GenBuster-200K}, a large-scale AI-generated video dataset featuring 200K high-resolution video clips, diverse latest generative techniques, and real-world scenes. We further introduce \textbf{BusterX}, a novel AI-generated video detection and explanation framework leveraging multimodal large language model (MLLM) and reinforcement learning for authenticity determination and explainable rationale. To our knowledge, GenBuster-200K is the {\it \textbf{first}} large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video dataset that incorporates the latest generative techniques for real-world scenarios. BusterX is the {\it \textbf{first}} framework to integrate MLLM with reinforcement learning for explainable AI-generated video detection. Extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods and ablation studies validate the effectiveness and generalizability of BusterX.

These complexities are difficult to address through traditional teaching methods, which often struggle to provide scalable, personalized feedback, especially in large classes. We introduce DUET (Diagrammatic UML & ER Tutor), a prototype of an LLM-based tool, which converts a reference diagram and a student-submitted diagram into a textual representation and provides structured feedback based on the differences. It uses a multi-stage LLM pipeline to compare diagrams and generate reflective feedback. Furthermore, the tool enables analytical insights for educators, aiming to foster self-directed learning and inform instructional strategies. We evaluated DUET through semi-structured interviews with six participants, including two educators and four teaching assistants. They identified strengths such as accessibility, scalability, and learning support alongside limitations, including reliability and potential misuse. Participants also suggested potential improvements, such as bulk upload functionality and interactive clarification features. DUET presents a promising direction for integrating LLMs into modeling education and offers a foundation for future classroom integration and empirical evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Learn...</summary><p>Learnersourcing: Student-generated Content @ Scale Workshop at L@S 2025</p></details> |

However, applying LLMs to long document reranking remains computationally expensive and may be ineffective. Moreover, the internal behavior of LLMs during document relevance judgment is still underexplored. In this paper, we begin with an in-depth analysis of decoder-only LLM attention patterns and find that several attention heads consistently align with relevance signals, yet this alignment deteriorates as irrelevant content increases. Motivated by this observation, we revisit and extend the block selection paradigm, introducing KeyB2, a scalable reranking framework that combines block pre-selection with powerful decoder-only LLMs. KeyB2 generalizes the selection stage to support BM25, cross-encoder, and bi-encoder, and adapts LLM to compute fine-grained relevance scores. We further introduce a new bi-encoder strategy that performs strongly and efficiently. Extensive experiments on TREC DL 2019/2023 document task, Robust04, and MLDR-zh demonstrate that KeyB2 outperforms baselines including RankLLaMA, RankLLaMA-MaxP/AvgP, and KeyB, achieving new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on TREC DL 2019 document reranking task. In addition, KeyB2 reduces reranking latency compared with RankLLaMA by over 83% and memory usage by over 74%, positioning it as a practical and effective solution for long document ranking with LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Existing safety methods typically assume uniform access and focus on preventing harmful or toxic outputs, without addressing role-specific access constraints. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs can be fine-tuned to generate responses that reflect the access privileges associated with different organizational roles. We explore three modeling strategies: a BERT-based classifier, an LLM-based classifier, and role-conditioned generation. To evaluate these approaches, we construct two complementary datasets. The first is adapted from existing instruction-tuning corpora through clustering and role labeling, while the second is synthetically generated to reflect realistic, role-sensitive enterprise scenarios. We assess model performance across varying organizational structures and analyze robustness to prompt injection, role mismatch, and jailbreak attempts.</p></details> |  |

We introduce EducationQ, a multi-agent dialogue framework that efficiently assesses teaching capabilities through simulated dynamic educational scenarios, featuring specialized agents for teaching, learning, and evaluation. Testing 14 LLMs across major AI Organizations (OpenAI, Meta, Google, Anthropic, and others) on 1,498 questions spanning 13 disciplines and 10 difficulty levels reveals that teaching effectiveness does not correlate linearly with model scale or general reasoning capabilities - with some smaller open-source models outperforming larger commercial counterparts in teaching contexts. This finding highlights a critical gap in current evaluations that prioritize knowledge recall over interactive pedagogy. Our mixed-methods evaluation, combining quantitative metrics with qualitative analysis and expert case studies, identifies distinct pedagogical strengths employed by top-performing models (e.g., sophisticated questioning strategies, adaptive feedback mechanisms).

| **[The Pragmatic Mind of Machines: Tracing the Emergence of Pragmatic Competence in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18497v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emerging capabilities in social intelligence tasks, including implicature resolution and theory-of-mind reasoning, both of which require substantial pragmatic understanding. However, how LLMs acquire this pragmatic competence throughout the training process remains poorly understood. In this work, we introduce ALTPRAG, a dataset grounded in the pragmatic concept of alternatives, to evaluate whether LLMs at different training stages can accurately infer nuanced speaker intentions. Each instance pairs two equally plausible yet pragmatically divergent continuations and requires the model to (i) infer the speaker's intended meaning and (ii) explain when and why a speaker would choose one utterance over its alternative, thus directly probing pragmatic competence through contrastive reasoning. We systematically evaluate 22 LLMs across 3 key training stages: after pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and preference optimization, to examine the development of pragmatic competence. Our results show that even base models exhibit notable sensitivity to pragmatic cues, which improves consistently with increases in model and data scale. Additionally, SFT and RLHF contribute further gains, particularly in cognitive-pragmatic scenarios. These findings highlight pragmatic competence as an emergent and compositional property of LLM training and offer new insights for aligning models with human communicative norms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards LLM-Enhanced Product Line Scoping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23410v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The idea of product line scoping is to identify the set of features and configurations that a product line should include, i.e., offer for configuration purposes. In this context, a major scoping task is to find a balance between commercial relevance and technical feasibility. Traditional product line scoping approaches rely on formal feature models and require a manual analysis which can be quite time-consuming. In this paper, we sketch how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be applied to support product line scoping tasks with a natural language interaction based scoping process. Using a working example from the smarthome domain, we sketch how LLMs can be applied to evaluate different feature model alternatives. We discuss open research challenges regarding the integration of LLMs with product line scoping.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic Modeling of Jailbreak on Multimodal LLMs: From Quantification to Application](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06989v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated their superior ability in understanding multimodal content. However, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which exploit weaknesses in their safety alignment to generate harmful responses. Previous studies categorize jailbreaks as successful or failed based on whether responses contain malicious content. However, given the stochastic nature of MLLM responses, this binary classification of an input's ability to jailbreak MLLMs is inappropriate. Derived from this viewpoint, we introduce jailbreak probability to quantify the jailbreak potential of an input, which represents the likelihood that MLLMs generated a malicious response when prompted with this input. We approximate this probability through multiple queries to MLLMs. After modeling the relationship between input hidden states and their corresponding jailbreak probability using Jailbreak Probability Prediction Network (JPPN), we use continuous jailbreak probability for optimization. Specifically, we propose Jailbreak-Probability-based Attack (JPA) that optimizes adversarial perturbations on input image to maximize jailbreak probability, and further enhance it as Multimodal JPA (MJPA) by including monotonic text rephrasing. To counteract attacks, we also propose Jailbreak-Probability-based Finetuning (JPF), which minimizes jailbreak probability through MLLM parameter updates. Extensive experiments show that (1) (M)JPA yields significant improvements when attacking a wide range of models under both white and black box settings. (2) JPF vastly reduces jailbreaks by at most over 60\%. Both of the above results demonstrate the significance of introducing jailbreak probability to make nuanced distinctions among input jailbreak abilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[MRGSEM-Sum: An Unsupervised Multi-document Summarization Framework based on Multi-Relational Graphs and Structural Entropy Minimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23400v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The core challenge faced by multi-document summarization is the complexity of relationships among documents and the presence of information redundancy. Graph clustering is an effective paradigm for addressing this issue, as it models the complex relationships among documents using graph structures and reduces information redundancy through clustering, achieving significant research progress. However, existing methods often only consider single-relational graphs and require a predefined number of clusters, which hinders their ability to fully represent rich relational information and adaptively partition sentence groups to reduce redundancy. To overcome these limitations, we propose MRGSEM-Sum, an unsupervised multi-document summarization framework based on multi-relational graphs and structural entropy minimization. Specifically, we construct a multi-relational graph that integrates semantic and discourse relations between sentences, comprehensively modeling the intricate and dynamic connections among sentences across documents. We then apply a two-dimensional structural entropy minimization algorithm for clustering, automatically determining the optimal number of clusters and effectively organizing sentences into coherent groups. Finally, we introduce a position-aware compression mechanism to distill each cluster, generating concise and informative summaries. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (Multi-News, DUC-2004, PubMed, and WikiSum) demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms previous unsupervised methods and, in several cases, achieves performance comparable to supervised models and large language models. Human evaluation demonstrates that the summaries generated by MRGSEM-Sum exhibit high consistency and coverage, approaching human-level quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond the Cloud: Assessing the Benefits and Drawbacks of Local LLM Deployment for Translators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23399v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models presents both opportunities and challenges for the translation field. While commercial, cloud-based AI chatbots have garnered significant attention in translation studies, concerns regarding data privacy, security, and equitable access necessitate exploration of alternative deployment models. This paper investigates the feasibility and performance of locally deployable, free language models as a viable alternative to proprietary, cloud-based AI solutions. This study evaluates three open-source models installed on CPU-based platforms and compared against commercially available online chat-bots. The evaluation focuses on functional performance rather than a comparative analysis of human-machine translation quality, an area already subject to extensive research. The platforms assessed were chosen for their accessibility and ease of use across various operating systems. While local deployment introduces its own challenges, the benefits of enhanced data control, improved privacy, and reduced dependency on cloud services are compelling. The findings of this study contribute to a growing body of knowledge concerning the democratization of AI technology and inform future research and development efforts aimed at making LLMs more accessible and practical for a wider range of users, specifically focusing on the needs of individual translators and small businesses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal2Vec: Improving Decoder-only LLMs as Versatile Embedding Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23386v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decoder-only large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to build embedding models that effectively encode the semantic information of natural language texts into dense vector representations for various embedding tasks. However, many existing methods primarily focus on removing the causal attention mask in LLMs to enable bidirectional attention, potentially undermining the model's ability to extract semantic information acquired during pretraining. Additionally, leading unidirectional approaches often rely on extra input text to overcome the inherent limitations of causal attention, inevitably increasing computational costs. In this work, we propose Causal2Vec, a general-purpose embedding model tailored to enhance the performance of decoder-only LLMs without altering their original architectures or introducing significant computational overhead. Specifically, we first employ a lightweight BERT-style model to pre-encode the input text into a single Contextual token, which is then prepended to the LLM's input sequence, allowing each token to capture contextualized information even without attending to future tokens. Furthermore, to mitigate the recency bias introduced by last-token pooling and help LLMs better leverage the semantic information encoded in the Contextual token, we concatenate the last hidden states of Contextual and EOS tokens as the final text embedding. In practice, Causal2Vec achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Massive Text Embeddings Benchmark (MTEB) among models trained solely on publicly available retrieval datasets, while reducing the required sequence length by up to 85% and inference time by up to 82% compared to best-performing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[MPCC: A Novel Benchmark for Multimodal Planning with Complex Constraints in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23382v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal planning capabilities refer to the ability to predict, reason, and design steps for task execution with multimodal context, which is essential for complex reasoning and decision-making across multiple steps. However, current benchmarks face two key challenges: (1) they cannot directly assess multimodal real-world planning capabilities, and (2) they lack constraints or implicit constraints across modalities. To address these issues, we introduce Multimodal Planning with Complex Constraints (MPCC), the first benchmark to systematically evaluate MLLMs' ability to handle multimodal constraints in planning. To address the first challenge, MPCC focuses on three real-world tasks: Flight Planning, Calendar Planning, and Meeting Planning. To solve the second challenge, we introduce complex constraints (e.g. budget, temporal, and spatial) in these tasks, with graded difficulty levels (EASY, MEDIUM, HARD) to separate constraint complexity from search space expansion. Experiments on 13 advanced MLLMs reveal significant challenges: closed-source models achieve only 21.3% feasible plans, while open-source models average below 11%. Additionally, we observe that MLLMs are highly sensitive to constraint complexity and that traditional multimodal prompting strategies fail in multi-constraint scenarios. Our work formalizes multimodal constraints in planning, provides a rigorous evaluation framework, and highlights the need for advancements in constraint-aware reasoning for real-world MLLM applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM Multimedia 2025</p></details> |

To serve as effective pilot testing tools, the performance of these LLMs is typically benchmarked against their ability to reproduce the outcomes of past structured surveys. This evaluation paradigm, however, is misaligned with the dynamic, context-rich social media environments where public opinion is increasingly formed and expressed. By design, surveys strip away the social, cultural, and temporal context that shapes public opinion, and LLM benchmarks built on this paradigm inherit these critical limitations. To bridge this gap, we introduce MindVote, the first benchmark for public opinion distribution prediction grounded in authentic social media discourse. MindVote is constructed from 3,918 naturalistic polls sourced from Reddit and Weibo, spanning 23 topics and enriched with detailed annotations for platform, topical, and temporal context. Using this benchmark, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 15 LLMs. MindVote provides a robust, ecologically valid framework to move beyond survey-based evaluations and advance the development of more socially intelligent AI systems.</p></details> |  |

To meet the increasing demands for individualized railway service, we develop LLM4Rail - a novel LLM-augmented railway service consulting platform. Empowered by LLM, LLM4Rail can provide custom modules for ticketing, railway food & drink recommendations, weather information, and chitchat. In LLM4Rail, we propose the iterative "Question-Thought-Action-Observation (QTAO)" prompting framework. It meticulously integrates verbal reasoning with task-oriented actions, that is, reasoning to guide action selection, to effectively retrieve external observations relevant to railway operation and service to generate accurate responses. To provide personalized onboard dining services, we first construct the Chinese Railway Food and Drink (CRFD-25) - a publicly accessible takeout dataset tailored for railway services. CRFD-25 covers a wide range of signature dishes categorized by cities, cuisines, age groups, and spiciness levels. We further introduce an LLM-based zero-shot conversational recommender for railway catering. To address the unconstrained nature of open recommendations, the feature similarity-based post-processing step is introduced to ensure all the recommended items are aligned with CRFD-25 dataset.</p></details> |  |

With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), substantial progress has been made in addressing real-world software engineering tasks. Recent studies have introduced ensemble reasoning techniques to enhance the performance of LLM-based issue resolution. However, existing prompting-based methods still face limitations in effectively exploring large ensemble spaces and lack the capacity for repository-level understanding, both of which constrain their overall effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Trae Agent, the first agent-based ensemble reasoning approach for repository-level issue resolution. Trae Agent formulates our goal as an optimal solution search problem and addresses two key challenges, i.e., large ensemble spaces and repository-level understanding, through modular agents for generation, pruning, and selection. We conduct extensive experiments using three leading LLMs on the widely-adopted SWE-bench benchmark, comparing Trae Agent against four state-of-the-art ensemble reasoning techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that Trae Agent consistently achieves superior performance, with an average improvement of 10.22% over all baselines in terms of Pass@1. Trae Agent has achieved first place on the SWE-bench Verified leaderboard, with a notable Pass@1 score of 75.20%. We are pleased to release Trae Agent as an open-source project to support the research community, with all resources available at https://github.com/bytedance/trae-agent.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pengf...</summary><p>Pengfei Gao and Zhao Tian contributed equally to this technical report</p></details> |

Prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) enhance reliability by eliciting intermediate reasoning steps or aggregating multiple outputs. However, they lack mechanisms for enforcing logical structure and assessing internal coherence. We introduce Theorem-of-Thought (ToTh), a novel framework that models reasoning as collaboration among three parallel agents, each simulating a distinct mode of inference: abductive, deductive, and inductive. Each agent produces a reasoning trace, which is structured into a formal reasoning graph. To evaluate consistency, we apply Bayesian belief propagation guided by natural language inference (NLI), assigning confidence scores to each step. The most coherent graph is selected to derive the final answer. Experiments on symbolic (WebOfLies) and numerical (MultiArith) reasoning benchmarks show that ToTh consistently outperforms CoT, Self-Consistency, and CoT-Decoding across multiple LLMs, while producing interpretable and logically grounded reasoning chains. Our findings suggest a promising direction for building more robust and cognitively inspired LLM reasoning. The implementation is available at https://github.com/KurbanIntelligenceLab/theorem-of-thought.</p></details> | ACL 2025 KnowFM |

The first album explicitly poses the question: What happens when I collide my junk mail with these platforms? The second album is a direct response to the first, and toys with the inability of state-of-the-art prompt-based AI music generation platforms to generate music that is not ``practiced'', ``polished'', and ``produced''. I seed a large language model (LLM) with information about these albums and have it interview me, which results in the exploration of several deeper questions: To what extent am I the author? Where am I in the resulting music? How is my musical identity changing as I am faced with machines that are in some ways far more talented than I? What new musical spaces does my work open, for me or anyone/thing else? I conclude by reflecting on my reflections, as well as LLM-mediated self-reflection as method.</p></details> |  |

However, the lack of specialized and comprehensive benchmarks for end-to-end speech LLM evaluation hinders optimizing the user experience of Audio LLMs in real-world applications. Existing evaluation methods often adapt text-based benchmarks, overlooking speech's unique characteristics and challenges, including prosody, homophones, stuttering, and differing user expectations. Here, we present a novel approach to thoroughly evaluate LLMs in practical speech conversations. We systematically curate real-world chat data relevant to spoken scenarios, introduce diversity in speaker attributes and acoustic conditions, and augment the dataset with speech-specific phenomena. We further design a query-aware evaluation method to use customized evaluation checklists and prompts to enhance the accuracy of automatic evaluation. We conduct comprehensive testing and detailed analysis of various mainstream speech models, revealing significant differences in model performance across different speech scenarios. The use of query-aware evaluation further enables a finer-grained assessment under various speech-specific scenarios. Our benchmark can provide valuable insights for speech model development and evaluation.</p></details> |  |

Targeting this problem, we introduce Visual Number Benchmark (VisNumBench) to evaluate the number sense abilities of MLLMs across a wide range of visual numerical tasks. VisNumBench consists of about 1,900 multiple-choice question-answer pairs derived from both synthetic and real-world visual data, covering seven visual numerical attributes and four types of visual numerical estimation tasks. Our experiments on VisNumBench led to the following key findings: (i) The 17 MLLMs we tested, including open-source models such as Qwen2.5-VL and InternVL2.5, as well as proprietary models like GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash, perform significantly below human levels in number sense-related tasks. (ii) Multimodal mathematical models and multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) models did not exhibit significant improvements in number sense abilities. (iii) Stronger MLLMs with larger parameter sizes and broader general abilities demonstrate modest gains in number sense abilities. We believe VisNumBench will serve as a valuable resource for the research community, encouraging further advancements in enhancing MLLMs' number sense abilities.

However, current agents act as memoryless explorers - treating each problem separately without retaining or reusing knowledge from previous repair experiences. This leads to redundant exploration of failed trajectories and missed chances to adapt successful issue resolution methods to similar problems. To address this problem, we introduce SWE-Exp, an experience - enhanced approach that distills concise and actionable experience from prior agent trajectories, enabling continuous learning across issues. Our method introduces a multi-faceted experience bank that captures both successful and failed repair attempts. Specifically, it extracts reusable issue resolution knowledge at different levels - from high-level problem comprehension to specific code changes. Experiments show that SWE-Exp achieves state-of-the-art resolution rate (41.6% Pass@1) on SWE-bench-Verified under open-source agent frameworks.

Recent research efforts have progressively extended this paradigm to multimodal reasoning tasks. Due to the inherent complexity and diversity of multimodal tasks, especially in semantic content and problem formulations, existing models often exhibit unstable performance across various domains and difficulty levels. To address these limitations, we propose VL-Cogito, an advanced multimodal reasoning model trained via a novel multi-stage Progressive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (PCuRL) framework. PCuRL systematically guides the model through tasks of gradually increasing difficulty, substantially improving its reasoning abilities across diverse multimodal contexts. The framework introduces two key innovations: (1) an online difficulty soft weighting mechanism, dynamically adjusting training difficulty across successive RL training stages; and (2) a dynamic length reward mechanism, which encourages the model to adaptively regulate its reasoning path length according to task complexity, thus balancing reasoning efficiency with correctness. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that VL-Cogito consistently matches or surpasses existing reasoning-oriented models across mainstream multimodal benchmarks spanning mathematics, science, logic, and general understanding, validating the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 5 figures, 6 tables.

In task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, this separation is explicit, using an external database structured by an explicit ontology to ensure explainability and controllability. However, building such ontologies requires manual labels or supervised training. We introduce TeQoDO: a Text-to-SQL task-oriented Dialogue Ontology construction method. Here, an LLM autonomously builds a TOD ontology from scratch without supervision using its inherent SQL programming capabilities combined with dialogue theory provided in the prompt. We show that TeQoDO outperforms transfer learning approaches, and its constructed ontology is competitive on a downstream dialogue state tracking task. Ablation studies demonstrate the key role of dialogue theory. TeQoDO also scales to allow construction of much larger ontologies, which we investigate on a Wikipedia and ArXiv dataset. We view this as a step towards broader application of ontologies to increase LLM explainability.</p></details> |  |

Although many fine-tuning techniques have been developed to reduce the time and computational cost involved, the challenge persists as LLMs continue to grow in size and complexity. To address this, a new approach to knowledge expansion in LLMs is needed. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers one such alternative by storing external knowledge in a database and retrieving relevant chunks to support question answering. However, naive implementations of RAG face significant limitations in scalability and answer accuracy. This paper introduces KeyKnowledgeRAG (K2RAG), a novel framework designed to overcome these limitations. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer paradigm, K2RAG integrates dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text summarization to improve retrieval quality and system efficiency. The framework also includes a preprocessing step that summarizes the training data, significantly reducing the training time. K2RAG was evaluated using the MultiHopRAG dataset, where the proposed pipeline was trained on the document corpus and tested on a separate evaluation set. Results demonstrated notable improvements over common naive RAG implementations. K2RAG achieved the highest mean answer similarity score of 0.57, and reached the highest third quartile (Q3) similarity of 0.82, indicating better alignment with ground-truth answers. In addition to improved accuracy, the framework proved highly efficient. The summarization step reduced the average training time of individual components by 93%, and execution speed was up to 40% faster than traditional knowledge graph-based RAG systems. K2RAG also demonstrated superior scalability, requiring three times less VRAM than several naive RAG implementations tested in this study.</p></details> | 21 pages, 14 figures |

Recently, agent-based frameworks such as SWE-agent have further advanced this progress by enabling autonomous, tool-using agents to tackle complex software engineering tasks. While existing agent-based issue resolution approaches are primarily based on agents' independent explorations, they often get stuck in local solutions and fail to identify issue patterns that span across different parts of the codebase. To address this limitation, we propose SWE-Debate, a competitive multi-agent debate framework that encourages diverse reasoning paths and achieves more consolidated issue localization. SWE-Debate first creates multiple fault propagation traces as localization proposals by traversing a code dependency graph. Then, it organizes a three-round debate among specialized agents, each embodying distinct reasoning perspectives along the fault propagation trace. This structured competition enables agents to collaboratively converge on a consolidated fix plan. Finally, this consolidated fix plan is integrated into an MCTS-based code modification agent for patch generation. Experiments on the SWE-bench benchmark show that SWE-Debate achieves new state-of-the-art results in open-source agent frameworks and outperforms baselines by a large margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code and data are available at https://github.com/YerbaPage/SWE-Debate</p></details> |

We present our latest Hindi-English bi-lingual LLM \textbf{Mantra-14B} with ~3\% average improvement in benchmark scores over both languages, outperforming models twice its size. Using a curated dataset composed of English and Hindi instruction data of 485K samples, we instruction tuned models such as Qwen-2.5-14B-Instruct and Phi-4 to improve performance over both English and Hindi. Our experiments encompassing seven different LLMs of varying parameter sizes and over 140 training attempts with varying English-Hindi training data ratios demonstrated that it is possible to significantly improve multilingual performance without compromising native performance. Further, our approach avoids resource-intensive techniques like vocabulary expansion or architectural modifications, thus keeping the model size small. Our results indicate that modest fine-tuning with culturally and locally informed data can bridge performance gaps without incurring significant computational overhead. We release our training code, datasets, and models under mit and apache licenses to aid further research towards under-represented and low-resource languages.</p></details> | 24 pages, 18 figures |

In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark specifically crafted to reflect real-world user interactions with data science agents by observing usage of our commercial applications. We evaluate three LLMs: Claude-4.0-Sonnet, Gemini-2.5-Flash, and OpenAI-o4-Mini across three approaches: zero-shot with context engineering, multi-step with context engineering, and with SmolAgent. Our benchmark assesses performance across a diverse set of eight data science task categories, additionally exploring the sensitivity of models to common prompting issues, such as data leakage and slightly ambiguous instructions. We further investigate the influence of temperature parameters on overall and task-specific outcomes for each model and approach. Our findings reveal distinct performance disparities among the evaluated models and methodologies, highlighting critical factors that affect practical deployment.

While they exhibit strong zero-shot performance on various tasks, LLMs' effectiveness in music-related applications remains limited due to the relatively small proportion of music-specific knowledge in their training data. To address this limitation, we propose MusT-RAG, a comprehensive framework based on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to adapt general-purpose LLMs for text-only music question answering (MQA) tasks. RAG is a technique that provides external knowledge to LLMs by retrieving relevant context information when generating answers to questions. To optimize RAG for the music domain, we (1) propose MusWikiDB, a music-specialized vector database for the retrieval stage, and (2) utilizes context information during both inference and fine-tuning processes to effectively transform general-purpose LLMs into music-specific models. Our experiment demonstrates that MusT-RAG significantly outperforms traditional fine-tuning approaches in enhancing LLMs' music domain adaptation capabilities, showing consistent improvements across both in-domain and out-of-domain MQA benchmarks. Additionally, our MusWikiDB proves substantially more effective than general Wikipedia corpora, delivering superior performance and computational efficiency.</p></details> | 8 pages, 2 figures |

Inspired by cultural geography across five continents, we propose Cultural Palette, a multi-agent framework that redefines cultural alignment as an adaptive "color-blending" process for country-specific adaptation. Our approach harnesses cultural geography across five continents (Africa, America, Asia, Europe, Oceania) through three key steps: First, we synthesize the Pentachromatic Cultural Palette Dataset using GPT-4o, refining continental-level dialogues with Hofstede's cultural dimensions to establish foundational cultural representations. Second, five continent-level alignment agents form specialized cultural communities that generate region-specific draft responses. Third, a Meta Agent employs Cultural MoErges to dynamically blend these cultural "colors" through attention-gated parameter merging, akin to mixing pigments on a palette, resolving conflicts while preserving cultural nuances to produce the final culturally-aligned response. Extensive experiments across various countries demonstrate that Cultural Palette surpasses existing baselines in cultural alignment.</p></details> | 20 pages, 10 figures |

While previous research has primarily focused on explicitly training models to moderate and detoxify sensitive content, there has been limited exploration of whether LLMs implicitly sanitize language without explicit instructions. This study empirically analyzes the implicit moderation behavior of GPT-4o-mini when paraphrasing sensitive content and evaluates the extent of sensitivity shifts. Our experiments indicate that GPT-4o-mini systematically moderates content toward less sensitive classes, with substantial reductions in derogatory and taboo language. Also, we evaluate the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs in classifying sentence sensitivity, comparing their performances against traditional methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Compute-Matched Re-Evaluation of TroVE on MATH](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22069v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reusing established theorems and formulas is central to mathematical problem solving, serving as essential building blocks for tackling increasingly complex challenges. Recent work, TroVE, argues that code-generating Large Language Models (LLMs) can benefit similarly on the MATH benchmark by inducing and reusing higher-level toolboxes. By allocating computational budget across an ensemble of three modes -- directly generating code, creating tools, and reusing tools -- TroVE claims to outperform a PRIMITIVE baseline that only performs direct generation. However, recent analysis (Berlot-Attwell et al., 2024) casts doubt on these gains, noting that the tools created are often trivial or rarely reused, suggesting that improvements may stem from self-consistency or self-correction. In this work, we re-evaluate TroVE on MATH, analyze the impact of each of its modes, and show that its benefit does not come from these mechanisms, but simply from a higher computational budget spent for TroVE compared to PRIMITIVE. To this end, we also perform a small correction in the original implementation of TroVE's selection mechanism, boosting TroVE's performance on MATH by 3\% in accuracy. After matching for compute, the benefit of TroVE reduces to a marginal improvement of 1\%, suggesting that this toolbox approach does not provide a significant benefit on MATH.</p></details> |  |
| **[LiMe: a Latin Corpus of Late Medieval Criminal Sentences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12829v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Latin language has received attention from the computational linguistics research community, which has built, over the years, several valuable resources, ranging from detailed annotated corpora to sophisticated tools for linguistic analysis. With the recent advent of large language models, researchers have also started developing models capable of generating vector representations of Latin texts. The performances of such models remain behind the ones for modern languages, given the disparity in available data. In this paper, we present the LiMe dataset, a corpus of 325 documents extracted from a series of medieval manuscripts called Libri sententiarum potestatis Mediolani, and thoroughly annotated by experts, in order to be employed for masked language model, as well as supervised natural language processing tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[LED Benchmark: Diagnosing Structural Layout Errors for Document Layout Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23295v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Document Layout Analysis through Large Language Models and Multimodal Models have significantly improved layout detection. However, despite these improvements, challenges remain in addressing critical structural errors, such as region merging, splitting, and missing content. Conventional evaluation metrics like IoU and mAP, which focus primarily on spatial overlap, are insufficient for detecting these errors. To address this limitation, we propose Layout Error Detection (LED), a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the structural robustness of document layout predictions. LED defines eight standardized error types, and formulates three complementary tasks: error existence detection, error type classification, and element-wise error type classification. Furthermore, we construct LED-Dataset, a synthetic dataset generated by injecting realistic structural errors based on empirical distributions from DLA models. Experimental results across a range of LMMs reveal that LED effectively differentiates structural understanding capabilities, exposing modality biases and performance trade-offs not visible through traditional metrics.</p></details> |  |

However, our field's focus on a human in the sensemaking loop raises critical questions about autonomy, delegation, and coordination for such \textit{agentic visualization} that preserve human agency while amplifying analytical capabilities. This paper addresses these questions by reinterpreting existing visualization systems with semi-automated or fully automatic AI components through an agentic lens. Based on this analysis, we extract a collection of design patterns for agentic visualization, including agentic roles, communication and coordination. These patterns provide a foundation for future agentic visualization systems that effectively harness AI agents while maintaining human insight and control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advances in LLMs with Focus on Reasoning, Adaptability, Efficiency and Ethics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12365v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This survey paper outlines the key developments in the field of Large Language Models (LLMs), including enhancements to their reasoning skills, adaptability to various tasks, increased computational efficiency, and the ability to make ethical decisions. The techniques that have been most effective in bridging the gap between human and machine communications include the Chain-of-Thought prompting, Instruction Tuning, and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback. The improvements in multimodal learning and few-shot or zero-shot techniques have further empowered LLMs to handle complex jobs with minor input. A significant focus is placed on efficiency, detailing scaling strategies, optimization techniques, and the influential Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, which strategically routes inputs to specialized subnetworks to boost predictive accuracy, while optimizing resource allocation. This survey also offers a broader perspective on recent advancements in LLMs, going beyond isolated aspects such as model architecture or ethical concerns. Additionally, it explores the role of LLMs in Agentic AI and their use as Autonomous Decision-Making Systems, and categorizes emerging methods that enhance LLM reasoning, efficiency, and ethical alignment. The survey also identifies underexplored areas such as interpretability, cross-modal integration, and sustainability. While significant advancements have been made in LLMs, challenges such as high computational costs, biases, and ethical risks remain. Overcoming these requires a focus on bias mitigation, transparent decision-making, and explicit ethical guidelines. Future research will generally focus on enhancing the model's ability to handle multiple inputs, thereby making it more intelligent, safe, and reliable.</p></details> |  |

Recent work leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to improve retrieval, especially for long or complex query-candidate pairs. However, we observe that the naive application of MLLMs, i.e., retrieval based on candidate likelihood, introduces candidate prior bias, favoring candidates with inherently higher priors over those more relevant to the query. To this end, we propose a novel retrieval framework, Bidirectional Likelihood Estimation with MLLM (BLiM), which leverages both query and candidate likelihoods by training the model to generate text from a given video as well as video features from a given text. Furthermore, we introduce Candidate Prior Normalization (CPN), a simple yet effective training-free score calibration module designed to mitigate candidate prior bias in candidate likelihood. On four Text-Video Retrieval benchmarks, our BLiM equipped with CPN outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 6.4 R@1 on average, effectively alleviating candidate prior bias and emphasizing query-candidate relevance. Our in-depth analysis across various multi-modal tasks beyond retrieval highlights the broad applicability of CPN which enhances visual understanding by reducing reliance on textual priors.

Our system leverages large language models to simultaneously extract knowledge triples and induce comprehensive schemas directly from text, modeling both entities and events while employing conceptualization to organize instances into semantic categories. Processing over 50 million documents, we construct ATLAS (Automated Triple Linking And Schema induction), a family of knowledge graphs with 900+ million nodes and 5.9 billion edges. This approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on multi-hop QA tasks and enhances LLM factuality. Notably, our schema induction achieves 95\% semantic alignment with human-crafted schemas with zero manual intervention, demonstrating that billion-scale knowledge graphs with dynamically induced schemas can effectively complement parametric knowledge in large language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, preprint, code: https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp/AutoSchemaKG</p></details> |
| **[Unveiling Super Experts in Mixture-of-Experts Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23279v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have shown promise in enhancing the learning capacity of large language models (LLMs). Leveraging the intrinsic importance differences among experts, recent research has explored expert-level compression techniques to improve the efficiency of MoE LLMs. However, existing approaches often rely on empirical criteria to identify critical experts, lacking a deeper exploration and understanding of the heterogeneous importance of experts. In this study, we present the first discovery and investigation of a distinct subset of experts that play a crucial role in the underlying mechanisms during the model's forward inference. These experts are prevalent in open-source MoE LLMs, and despite their limited number, pruning them leads to a significant decline in model performance (e.g., pruning three causes Qwen3-30B-A3B to produce repetitive and uninformative outputs). We refer to these experts as Super Experts (SEs). Our comprehensive analysis provides progressively deeper insights into SEs. (i) SEs are characterized by rare but extreme activation outliers in the output of the down_proj, which give rise to massive activations in the hidden states between decoder layers. Moreover, the distribution of SEs remains model-specific and is unaffected by post-training processes. (ii) By pruning SEs, we assess their significance across a variety of tasks, revealing their considerable impact on the model's overall performance, particularly in mathematical reasoning. (iii) We further enhance our understanding of the influence of SEs compression. Our findings confirm that MoE LLMs rely on SEs to induce attention sinks, which are crucial for the distribution of attention scores but are significantly disrupted by SE pruning. The code is available at https://github.com/ZunhaiSu/Super-Experts-Profilling.</p></details> |  |

Several influential works have already appeared in the field of AI Scientist systems, with AI-generated research papers having been accepted at the ICLR 2025 workshop, suggesting that a human-level AI Scientist capable of uncovering phenomena previously unknown to humans, may soon become a reality. In this survey, we focus on the central question: How far are AI scientists from changing the world and reshaping the scientific research paradigm? To answer this question, we provide a prospect-driven review that comprehensively analyzes the current achievements of AI Scientist systems, identifying key bottlenecks and the critical components required for the emergence of a scientific agent capable of producing ground-breaking discoveries that solve grand challenges. We hope this survey will contribute to a clearer understanding of limitations of current AI Scientist systems, showing where we are, what is missing, and what the ultimate goals for scientific AI should be.</p></details> |  |

This document demonstrates through a concrete case study how our system transforms academic presentations into publication-ready chapters -- in less than three minutes.

| **[CEE: An Inference-Time Jailbreak Defense for Embodied Intelligence via Subspace Concept Rotation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13201v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly becoming the cognitive core of Embodied Intelligence (EI) systems, such as robots and autonomous vehicles. However, this integration also exposes them to serious jailbreak risks, where malicious instructions can be transformed into dangerous physical actions. Existing defense mechanisms suffer from notable drawbacks--including high training costs, significant inference delays, and complex hyperparameter tuning--which limit their practical applicability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel and efficient inference-time defense framework: Concept Enhancement Engineering (CEE). CEE enhances the model's inherent safety mechanisms by directly manipulating its internal representations, requiring neither additional training nor external modules, thereby improving defense efficiency. Furthermore, CEE introduces a rotation-based control mechanism that enables stable and linearly tunable behavioral control of the model. This design eliminates the need for tedious manual tuning and avoids the output degradation issues commonly observed in other representation engineering methods. Extensive experiments across multiple EI safety benchmarks and diverse attack scenarios demonstrate that CEE significantly improves the defense success rates of various multimodal LLMs. It effectively mitigates safety risks while preserving high-quality generation and inference efficiency, offering a promising solution for deploying safer embodied intelligence systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeIF-Bench: Evaluating Instruction-Following Capabilities of Large Language Models in Interactive Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22688v3)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in code generation tasks and have become indispensable programming assistants for developers. However, existing code generation benchmarks primarily assess the functional correctness of code generated by LLMs in single-turn interactions. They offer limited insight into LLMs' abilities to generate code that strictly follows users' instructions in multi-turn interaction scenarios. In this paper, we introduce CodeIF-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating the instruction-following capabilities of LLMs in interactive code generation. Specifically, CodeIF-Bench incorporates nine types of verifiable instructions aligned with the real-world software development requirements, which can be independently and objectively validated through specified test cases, facilitating the evaluation of instruction-following capability in multi-turn interactions. In both \textit{Static Conversation} and \textit{Dynamic Conversation} settings, we evaluate the performance of 7 state-of-the-art LLMs and summarize the important factors influencing the instruction-following ability of LLMs in multi-turn interactions, as well as potential directions for improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[TARS: MinMax Token-Adaptive Preference Strategy for Hallucination Reduction in MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21584v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable vision-language reasoning, yet often generate plausible outputs that are factually incorrect or visually ungrounded, thereby compromising their reliability. Direct preference optimization (DPO) is a common strategy for correcting hallucinations by aligning model outputs with human preferences. Existing DPO strategies typically treat hallucination-related preferences as fixed targets, relying on static supervision signals during training. This approach tends to overfit to superficial linguistic cues in preference data, leading to distributional rigidity and spurious correlations that impair grounding in causally relevant visual information. To overcome this limitation, we propose TARS, a token-adaptive preference strategy that reformulates DPO as a min-max optimization problem. TARS maximizes token-level distributional shifts under semantic constraints to simulate alignment uncertainty, and simultaneously minimizes the expected preference loss under these controlled perturbations. This joint objective preserves causal grounding while mitigating overfitting to preference patterns, thereby reducing hallucinations in multimodal reasoning. We evaluate TARS on multiple hallucination benchmarks and find consistently strong performance. Using only 4.8k preference samples and no expert feedback, TARS reduces hallucination rates from 26.4% to 13.2% and decreases cognition value from 2.5 to 0.4. It outperforms standard DPO and matches GPT-4o on several key metrics.</p></details> |  |

However, it remains a challenge due to its unique linguistic structure and computational constraints. In this work, we systematically investigate the challenges that hinder Bengali NLP performance by focusing on the absence of standardized evaluation benchmarks. We then evaluated 10 recent open source Large Language Models (LLMs) in 8 of the translated datasets and performed a comprehensive error analysis to pinpoint their primary failure modes. Our findings reveal consistent performance gaps for Bengali compared to English, particularly for smaller models and specific model families like Mistral. We also identified promising robustness in certain architectures, such as DeepSeek, that maintain more stable performance across languages. Our analysis reveals an inverse relationship between tokenization efficiency and LLM accuracy where models tend to perform worse when inputs are excessively tokenized, whereas more efficient \& concise tokenization results in improved performance. These findings highlight critical areas where current models fall short and underscore the need for improved dataset quality and evaluation methodologies tailored to multilingual contexts. This work will catalyze further research on NLP for underrepresented languages, helping to democratize access to advanced language technologies worldwide. The code and dataset used in this research is publicly available at https://github.com/BengaliAI/bn-llm-benchmark.</p></details> |  |

However, the reasoning aspects for explainability and dialogue discourse have not been explored previously for mental health. Hence, we are investigating the pragmatic reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) in this domain. We introduce P-ReMe dataset, and propose a modified definition for the pragmatic phenomena of implicature (implied meaning) and presupposition (implicit assumption) in mental health. Following the definition, we formulate two tasks in implicature and one task in presupposition. To benchmark the dataset and the presented tasks, we consider four models - Llama3.1, Mistral, MentaLLaMa, and Qwen. The results of the experiments suggest that Mistral and Qwen show substantial reasoning capabilities in the domain. In addition, we also propose StiPRompts to study the stigma around mental health with the state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4o mini, Deepseek-chat, and Claude-3.5-haiku. Our evaluated findings show that Claude-3.5-haiku deals with the stigma more responsibly compared to the other two LLMs.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose a prompting framework that generates adversarial variants of MWPs by adding irrelevant variables. We introduce a dataset, PROBLEMATHIC, containing both adversarial and non-adversarial MWPs. Our experiments reveal that LLMs are susceptible to distraction by numerical noise, resulting in an average relative performance drop of ~26% on adversarial MWPs. To mitigate this, we fine-tune LLMs (Llama-2, Mistral) on the adversarial samples from our dataset. Fine-tuning on adversarial training instances improves performance on adversarial MWPs by ~8%, indicating increased robustness to noise and improved ability to identify relevant data for reasoning. Finally, to assess the generalizability of our prompting framework, we introduce GSM-8K-Adv, an adversarial variant of the GSM-8K benchmark. LLMs continue to struggle when faced with adversarial information, reducing performance by up to 6%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025 Workshop on Reasoning and Planning for LLMs</p></details> |

This leaves critical blind spots in low-resource, multilingual regions such as Pakistan, where linguistic identity is closely tied to political, religious, and regional ideologies. We present a systematic evaluation of political bias in 13 state-of-the-art LLMs across five Pakistani languages: Urdu, Punjabi, Sindhi, Pashto, and Balochi. Our framework integrates a culturally adapted Political Compass Test (PCT) with multi-level framing analysis, capturing both ideological stance (economic/social axes) and stylistic framing (content, tone, emphasis). Prompts are aligned with 11 socio-political themes specific to the Pakistani context. Results show that while LLMs predominantly reflect liberal-left orientations consistent with Western training data, they exhibit more authoritarian framing in regional languages, highlighting language-conditioned ideological modulation. We also identify consistent model-specific bias patterns across languages. These findings show the need for culturally grounded, multilingual bias auditing frameworks in global NLP.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Accumulator-Aware Post-Training Quantization for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17092v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When quantizing weights and activations to increasingly narrower representations, the cost of additions begins to dominate that of multiplications in multiply-accumulate (MAC) units. Recent studies show that reducing addition costs via low-precision accumulation improves throughput, power, and area across inference platforms, albeit with an increased risk of overflow. Accumulator-aware quantization research has so far only considered the quantization-aware training (QAT) paradigm, in which models are fine-tuned or trained from scratch with quantization in the loop. As models and datasets continue to grow in size, QAT techniques become increasingly more expensive, which has motivated the recent surge in post-training quantization (PTQ) research. To bridge this gap, we introduce AXE, the first accumulator-aware quantization framework explicitly designed to endow overflow avoidance guarantees to PTQ algorithms. We present theoretical motivation for AXE and demonstrate its flexibility by implementing it on top of two existing algorithms: GPFQ and OPTQ. We design AXE to support multi-stage accumulation, opening the door to full datapath optimization for the first time. We evaluate AXE using recent language generation models; when quantizing Llama3 8B for a 16-bit multi-stage accumulation datapath, AXE maintains up to 98% of the FP16 perplexity, surpassing naive bit width manipulation by up to 15%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-Grained Privacy Extraction from Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems via Knowledge Asymmetry Exploitation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23229v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems enhance large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge bases, but this advancement introduces significant privacy risks. Existing privacy attacks on RAG systems can trigger data leakage but often fail to accurately isolate knowledge-base-derived sentences within mixed responses. They also lack robustness when applied across multiple domains. This paper addresses these challenges by presenting a novel black-box attack framework that exploits knowledge asymmetry between RAG and standard LLMs to achieve fine-grained privacy extraction across heterogeneous knowledge landscapes. We propose a chain-of-thought reasoning strategy that creates adaptive prompts to steer RAG systems away from sensitive content. Specifically, we first decompose adversarial queries to maximize information disparity and then apply a semantic relationship scoring to resolve lexical and syntactic ambiguities. We finally train a neural network on these feature scores to precisely identify sentences containing private information. Unlike prior work, our framework generalizes to unseen domains through iterative refinement without pre-defined knowledge. Experimental results show that we achieve over 91% privacy extraction rate in single-domain and 83% in multi-domain scenarios, reducing sensitive sentence exposure by over 65% in case studies. This work bridges the gap between attack and defense in RAG systems, enabling precise extraction of private information while providing a foundation for adaptive mitigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enabling Few-Shot Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis on Tabular Biomarker Data with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23227v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a complex neurodegenerative disorder, requires analysis of heterogeneous biomarkers (e.g., neuroimaging, genetic risk factors, cognitive tests, and cerebrospinal fluid proteins) typically represented in a tabular format. With flexible few-shot reasoning, multimodal integration, and natural-language-based interpretability, large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities for prediction with structured biomedical data. We propose a novel framework called TAP-GPT, Tabular Alzheimer's Prediction GPT, that adapts TableGPT2, a multimodal tabular-specialized LLM originally developed for business intelligence tasks, for AD diagnosis using structured biomarker data with small sample sizes. Our approach constructs few-shot tabular prompts using in-context learning examples from structured biomedical data and finetunes TableGPT2 using the parameter-efficient qLoRA adaption for a clinical binary classification task of AD or cognitively normal (CN). The TAP-GPT framework harnesses the powerful tabular understanding ability of TableGPT2 and the encoded prior knowledge of LLMs to outperform more advanced general-purpose LLMs and a tabular foundation model (TFM) developed for prediction tasks. To our knowledge, this is the first application of LLMs to the prediction task using tabular biomarker data, paving the way for future LLM-driven multi-agent frameworks in biomedical informatics.</p></details> |  |

Existing evaluation methods suffer from issues such as data contamination, black-box operation, and subjective preference. These issues make it difficult to evaluate the LLMs' true capabilities comprehensively. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel benchmark-free evaluation paradigm, LLM-Crowdsourced. It utilizes LLMs to generate questions, answer independently, and evaluate mutually. This method integrates four key evaluation criteria: dynamic, transparent, objective, and professional, which existing evaluation methods cannot satisfy simultaneously. Experiments on eight mainstream LLMs across mathematics and programming verify the advantages of our method in distinguishing LLM performance. Furthermore, our study reveals several novel findings that are difficult for traditional methods to detect, including but not limited to: (1) Gemini demonstrates the highest original and professional question-design capabilities among others; (2) Some LLMs exhibit ''memorization-based answering'' by misrecognizing questions as familiar ones with a similar structure; (3) LLM evaluation results demonstrate high consistency (robustness).</p></details> |  |
| **[Navigating the Alpha Jungle: An LLM-Powered MCTS Framework for Formulaic Factor Mining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11122v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alpha factor mining is pivotal in quantitative investment for identifying predictive signals from complex financial data. While traditional formulaic alpha mining relies on human expertise, contemporary automated methods, such as those based on genetic programming or reinforcement learning, often struggle with search inefficiency or yield alpha factors that are difficult to interpret. This paper introduces a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to overcome these limitations. Our framework leverages the LLM's instruction-following and reasoning capability to iteratively generate and refine symbolic alpha formulas within an MCTS-driven exploration. A key innovation is the guidance of MCTS exploration by rich, quantitative feedback from financial backtesting of each candidate factor, enabling efficient navigation of the vast search space. Furthermore, a frequent subtree avoidance mechanism is introduced to enhance search diversity and prevent formulaic homogenization, further improving performance. Experimental results on real-world stock market data demonstrate that our LLM-based framework outperforms existing methods by mining alphas with superior predictive accuracy and trading performance. The resulting formulas are also more amenable to human interpretation, establishing a more effective and efficient paradigm for formulaic alpha mining.</p></details> |  |

We present a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed solution in charging scheduling and optimization for electric vehicles, highlighting our solution's significant advancements in energy efficiency and user adaptability. This work underscores the potential of LLMs for energy optimization and fosters a new era of intelligent DSM solutions.</p></details> | 11 Pages |

We introduce \textit{DocsRay}, a training-free document understanding system that integrates pseudo Table of Contents (TOC) generation with hierarchical Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Our approach leverages multimodal Large Language Models' (LLMs) native capabilities to seamlessly process documents containing diverse elements such as text, images, charts, and tables without requiring specialized models or additional training. DocsRay's framework synergistically combines three key techniques: (1) a semantic structuring module using prompt-based LLM interactions to generate a hierarchical pseudo-TOC, (2) zero-shot multimodal analysis that converts diverse document elements into unified, text-centric representations using the inherent capabilities of multimodal LLMs, and (3) an efficient two-stage hierarchical retrieval system that reduces retrieval complexity from $O(N)$ to $O(S + k_1 \cdot N_s)$. Evaluated on documents averaging 49.4 pages and 20,971 textual tokens, DocsRay reduced query latency from 3.89 to 2.12 seconds, achieving a 45% efficiency improvement. On the MMLongBench-Doc benchmark, DocsRay-Pro attains an accuracy of 64.7%, substantially surpassing previous state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |

Our study suggests a concerning reality: Large Language Models (LLMs) fail to represent diverse cultural moral frameworks despite their linguistic capabilities. We expose significant gaps between AI-generated and human moral intuitions by applying the Moral Foundations Questionnaire across 19 cultural contexts. Comparing multiple state-of-the-art LLMs' origins against human baseline data, we find these models systematically homogenize moral diversity. Surprisingly, increased model size doesn't consistently improve cultural representation fidelity. Our findings challenge the growing use of LLMs as synthetic populations in social science research and highlight a fundamental limitation in current AI alignment approaches. Without data-driven alignment beyond prompting, these systems cannot capture the nuanced, culturally-specific moral intuitions. Our results call for more grounded alignment objectives and evaluation metrics to ensure AI systems represent diverse human values rather than flattening the moral landscape.</p></details> | <details><summary>15pag...</summary><p>15pages, 1 figure, 2 tables</p></details> |

Recent research has focused on retrieving corresponding examples for each input query, not only enhancing the efficiency and scalability of the learning process but also mitigating inherent biases in manual example selection. However, these studies have primarily emphasized leveraging Positive samples while overlooking the additional information within Negative samples for contextual learning. We propose a novel method that utilizes Negative samples to better select Positive sample examples, thereby enhancing the performance of few-shot ICL. Initially, we construct Positive and Negative sample corpora based on Zero-Shot-Cot. Then, during inference, we employ a semantic similarity-based approach to select the most similar examples from both the Positive and Negative corpora for a given query. Subsequently, we further retrieve Positive examples from the Positive sample corpus based on semantic similarity to the Negative examples, then concatenating them with the previously selected Positive examples to serve as ICL demonstrations. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach surpasses methods solely relying on the most similar positive examples for context, validating that the additional information in negative samples aids in enhancing ICL performance through improved Positive sample selection.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods for temporal expression either conflate time with text-based numerical values, add a series of dedicated temporal tokens, or regress time using specialized temporal grounding heads. To address these issues, we introduce DisTime, a lightweight framework designed to enhance temporal comprehension in Video-LLMs. DisTime employs a learnable token to create a continuous temporal embedding space and incorporates a Distribution-based Time Decoder that generates temporal probability distributions, effectively mitigating boundary ambiguities and maintaining temporal continuity. Additionally, the Distribution-based Time Encoder re-encodes timestamps to provide time markers for Video-LLMs. To overcome temporal granularity limitations in existing datasets, we propose an automated annotation paradigm that combines the captioning capabilities of Video-LLMs with the localization expertise of dedicated temporal models. This leads to the creation of InternVid-TG, a substantial dataset with 1.25M temporally grounded events across 179k videos, surpassing ActivityNet-Caption by 55 times. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DisTime achieves state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks in three time-sensitive tasks while maintaining competitive performance in Video QA tasks.

To address the above challenges, we propose an adversarial-guided diffusion (AGD) approach for adversarial attack MLLMs. We introduce adversarial-guided noise to ensure attack efficacy. A key observation in our design is that, unlike most traditional adversarial attacks which embed high-frequency perturbations directly into the clean image, AGD injects target semantics into the noise component of the reverse diffusion. Since the added noise in a diffusion model spans the entire frequency spectrum, the adversarial signal embedded within it also inherits this full-spectrum property. Importantly, during reverse diffusion, the adversarial image is formed as a linear combination of the clean image and the noise. Thus, when applying defenses such as a simple low-pass filtering, which act independently on each component, the adversarial image within the noise component is less likely to be suppressed, as it is not confined to the high-frequency band. This makes AGD inherently robust to variety defenses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our AGD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in attack performance as well as in model robustness to some defenses.</p></details> |  |

While existing RLHF training systems have enabled significant progress, they often face challenges in scaling to multi-modal and diffusion workflows and adapting to dynamic workloads. In particular, current approaches may encounter limitations in controller scalability, flexible resource placement, and efficient orchestration when handling complex RLHF pipelines, especially in scenarios involving dynamic sampling or generative reward modeling. In this paper, we present \textbf{G-Core}, a simple, scalable, and balanced RLHF training framework designed to address these challenges. G-Core introduces a parallel controller programming model, enabling flexible and efficient orchestration of complex RLHF workflows without the bottlenecks of a single centralized controller. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic placement schema that adaptively partitions resources and schedules workloads, significantly reducing hardware idle time and improving utilization, even under highly variable training conditions. G-Core has successfully trained models that support WeChat product features serving a large-scale user base, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in real-world scenarios. Our results show that G-Core advances the state of the art in RLHF training, providing a solid foundation for future research and deployment of large-scale, human-aligned models.</p></details> | <details><summary>I hav...</summary><p>I haven't received company approval yet, and I uploaded it by mistake</p></details> |

However, their effectiveness remains constrained when reasoning extends beyond the knowledge acquired during pretraining. Conventional approaches, such as fine-tuning or retrieval-augmented generation, face limitations in either imposing high computational overhead or failing to fully exploit structured scientific data. To overcome these challenges, we propose DrugMCTS, a novel framework that synergistically integrates RAG, multi-agent collaboration, and Monte Carlo Tree Search for drug repositioning. The framework employs five specialized agents tasked with retrieving and analyzing molecular and protein information, thereby enabling structured and iterative reasoning. Extensive experiments on the DrugBank and KIBA datasets demonstrate that DrugMCTS achieves substantially higher recall and robustness compared to both general-purpose LLMs and deep learning baselines. Our results highlight the importance of structured reasoning, agent-based collaboration, and feedback-driven search mechanisms in advancing LLM applications for drug repositioning.</p></details> |  |

Although many fine-tuning techniques have been developed to reduce the time and computational cost involved, the challenge persists as LLMs continue to grow in size and complexity. To address this, a new approach to knowledge expansion in LLMs is needed. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers one such alternative by storing external knowledge in a database and retrieving relevant chunks to support question answering. However, naive implementations of RAG face significant limitations in scalability and answer accuracy. This paper introduces KeyKnowledgeRAG (K2RAG), a novel framework designed to overcome these limitations. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer paradigm, K2RAG integrates dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text summarization to improve retrieval quality and system efficiency. The framework also includes a preprocessing step that summarizes the training data, significantly reducing the training time. K2RAG was evaluated using the MultiHopRAG dataset, where the proposed pipeline was trained on the document corpus and tested on a separate evaluation set. Results demonstrated notable improvements over common naive RAG implementations. K2RAG achieved the highest mean answer similarity score of 0.57, and reached the highest third quartile (Q3) similarity of 0.82, indicating better alignment with ground-truth answers. In addition to improved accuracy, the framework proved highly efficient. The summarization step reduced the average training time of individual components by 93%, and execution speed was up to 40% faster than traditional knowledge graph-based RAG systems. K2RAG also demonstrated superior scalability, requiring three times less VRAM than several naive RAG implementations tested in this study.</p></details> | 21 pages, 14 figures |

Currently, text visualizations are confined either to _flat, line-based_ decorations, which can convey only limited information about textual structure, or _nested boxes_, which convey structure but often destroy the typographic layout of the underlying text. We hypothesize that the lack of rich styling options limits the kinds of information that are displayed alongside text, wherever it may be displayed. In this paper, we show that it is possible to achieve arbitrarily nested decorations while minimally disturbing the underlying typographic layout. Specifically, we present a layout algorithm that generates _ragged blocks_, or _rocks_, which are rectilinear polygons that allow nested text to be compactly rendered even when styled with borders and padding. Our layout algorithm is evaluated on a benchmark suite comprising representative source code files in multiple programming languages. The (ragged block) layouts produced by our algorithm are substantially more compact than the (rectangular block) layouts produced by conventional techniques, when uniformly styling every element in the syntax tree with borders and padding.</p></details> | <details><summary>UIST ...</summary><p>UIST 2025 Paper + Appendices</p></details> |

Existing fusion approaches typically rely on either instance-based proposals or dense BEV grids, which either lack holistic scene understanding or are limited by rigid grid structures. To address these, we propose RaGS, the first framework to leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) as representation for fusing 4D radar and monocular cues in 3D object detection. 3D GS naturally suits 3D object detection by modeling the scene as a field of Gaussians, dynamically allocating resources on foreground objects and providing a flexible, resource-efficient solution. RaGS uses a cascaded pipeline to construct and refine the Gaussian field. It starts with the Frustum-based Localization Initiation (FLI), which unprojects foreground pixels to initialize coarse 3D Gaussians positions. Then, the Iterative Multimodal Aggregation (IMA) fuses semantics and geometry, refining the limited Gaussians to the regions of interest. Finally, the Multi-level Gaussian Fusion (MGF) renders the Gaussians into multi-level BEV features for 3D object detection. By dynamically focusing on sparse objects within scenes, RaGS enable object concentrating while offering comprehensive scene perception. Extensive experiments on View-of-Delft, TJ4DRadSet, and OmniHD-Scenes benchmarks demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance. Code will be released.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, conference</p></details> |
| **[Culinary Crossroads: A RAG Framework for Enhancing Diversity in Cross-Cultural Recipe Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21934v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In cross-cultural recipe adaptation, the goal is not only to ensure cultural appropriateness and retain the original dish's essence, but also to provide diverse options for various dietary needs and preferences. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a promising approach, combining the retrieval of real recipes from the target cuisine for cultural adaptability with large language models (LLMs) for relevance. However, it remains unclear whether RAG can generate diverse adaptation results. Our analysis shows that RAG tends to overly rely on a limited portion of the context across generations, failing to produce diverse outputs even when provided with varied contextual inputs. This reveals a key limitation of RAG in creative tasks with multiple valid answers: it fails to leverage contextual diversity for generating varied responses. To address this issue, we propose CARRIAGE, a plug-and-play RAG framework for cross-cultural recipe adaptation that enhances diversity in both retrieval and context organization. To our knowledge, this is the first RAG framework that explicitly aims to generate highly diverse outputs to accommodate multiple user preferences. Our experiments show that CARRIAGE achieves Pareto efficiency in terms of diversity and quality of recipe adaptation compared to closed-book LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[FB-RAG: Improving RAG with Forward and Backward Lookup](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17206v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) struggles with complex queries that lack strong signals to retrieve the most relevant context, forcing a trade-off between choosing a small context that misses key information and a large context that confuses the LLM. To address this, we propose Forward-Backward RAG (FB-RAG), a new training-free framework based on a simple yet powerful forward-looking strategy. FB-RAG employs a light-weight LLM to peek into potential future generations, using evidence from multiple sampled outputs to precisely identify the most relevant context for a final, more powerful generator. This improves performance without complex finetuning or Reinforcement Learning common in prior work. Across 9 datasets, FB-RAG consistently delivers strong results. Further, the performance gains can be achieved with reduced latency due to a shorter, more focused prompt for the powerful generator. On EN.QA dataset, FB-RAG matches the leading baseline with over 48% latency reduction or achieves an 8% performance improvement with a 10% latency reduction. Our analysis finds cases where even when the forward-looking LLM fails to generate correct answers, its attempts are sufficient to guide the final model to an accurate response, demonstrating how smaller LLMs can systematically improve the performance and efficiency of larger ones.</p></details> |  |

The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, combining language models (LLMs) with search engines, is particularly notable for its ability to generate responses from document corpora. Despite its potential, the reliability of RAG systems in critical contexts remains a concern, with issues such as hallucinations persisting. This study evaluates a RAG system used in due diligence for an investment fund. We propose a robust evaluation protocol combining human annotations and LLM-Judge annotations to identify system failures, like hallucinations, off-topic, failed citations, and abstentions. Inspired by the Prediction Powered Inference (PPI) method, we achieve precise performance measurements with statistical guarantees. We provide a comprehensive dataset for further analysis. Our contributions aim to enhance the reliability and scalability of RAG systems evaluation protocols in industrial applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>in Fr...</summary><p>in French language.

| **[Validating Pharmacogenomics Generative Artificial Intelligence Query Prompts Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21453v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study evaluated Sherpa Rx, an artificial intelligence tool leveraging large language models and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for pharmacogenomics, to validate its performance on key response metrics. Sherpa Rx integrated Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines with Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB) data to generate contextually relevant responses. A dataset (N=260 queries) spanning 26 CPIC guidelines was used to evaluate drug-gene interactions, dosing recommendations, and therapeutic implications. In Phase 1, only CPIC data was embedded. Phase 2 additionally incorporated PharmGKB content. Responses were scored on accuracy, relevance, clarity, completeness (5-point Likert scale), and recall. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests compared accuracy between Phase 1 and Phase 2, and between Phase 2 and ChatGPT-4omini. A 20-question quiz assessed the tool's real-world applicability against other models. In Phase 1 (N=260), Sherpa Rx demonstrated high performance of accuracy 4.9, relevance 5.0, clarity 5.0, completeness 4.8, and recall 0.99. The subset analysis (N=20) showed improvements in accuracy (4.6 vs. 4.4, Phase 2 vs. Phase 1 subset) and completeness (5.0 vs. 4.8). ChatGPT-4omini performed comparably in relevance (5.0) and clarity (4.9) but lagged in accuracy (3.9) and completeness (4.2). Differences in accuracy between Phase 1 and Phase 2 was not statistically significant. However, Phase 2 significantly outperformed ChatGPT-4omini. On the 20-question quiz, Sherpa Rx achieved 90% accuracy, outperforming other models. Integrating additional resources like CPIC and PharmGKB with RAG enhances AI accuracy and performance. This study highlights the transformative potential of generative AI like Sherpa Rx in pharmacogenomics, improving decision-making with accurate, personalized responses.</p></details> |  |

We replicate an existing, challenging real-world annotation task with complex multi-part criteria on a set of thousands of pages of public disclosure documents from global systemically important banks (GSIBs) with heterogeneous and incomplete information content. We test two treatment conditions. First, a "naive" AI use condition in which annotators use only the tool and must accept the first answer they are given. And second, an "interactive" AI treatment condition where annotators use the tool interactively, and use their judgement to follow-up with additional information if necessary. Compared to the human-only baseline, the use of the AI tool accelerated task execution by up to a factor of 10 and enhanced task accuracy, particularly in the interactive condition. We find that when extrapolated to the full task, these methods could save up to 268 hours compared to the human-only approach. Additionally, our findings suggest that annotator skill, not just with the subject matter domain, but also with AI tools, is a factor in both the accuracy and speed of task performance.</p></details> |  |

The challenge aims to address a critical limitation of modern Vision Language Models (VLMs): their propensity to hallucinate, especially when faced with egocentric imagery, long-tail entities, and complex, multi-hop questions. This issue is particularly problematic in real-world applications where users pose fact-seeking queries that demand high factual accuracy across diverse modalities. To tackle this, we propose a robust, multi-stage framework that prioritizes factual accuracy and truthfulness over completeness. Our solution integrates a lightweight query router for efficiency, a query-aware retrieval and summarization pipeline, a dual-pathways generation and a post-hoc verification. This conservative strategy is designed to minimize hallucinations, which incur a severe penalty in the competition's scoring metric. Our approach achieved 3rd place in Task 1, demonstrating the effectiveness of prioritizing answer reliability in complex multi-modal RAG systems.

Moreover, current LLMs struggle to route queries across heterogeneous knowledge sources.

| **[Towards More Robust Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Evaluating RAG Under Adversarial Poisoning Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16708v2)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have emerged as a promising solution to mitigate LLM hallucinations and enhance their performance in knowledge-intensive domains. However, these systems are vulnerable to adversarial poisoning attacks, where malicious passages injected into the retrieval corpus can mislead models into producing factually incorrect outputs. In this paper, we present a rigorously controlled empirical study of how RAG systems behave under such attacks and how their robustness can be improved. On the generation side, we introduce a structured taxonomy of context types-adversarial, untouched, and guiding-and systematically analyze their individual and combined effects on model outputs. On the retrieval side, we evaluate several retrievers to measure how easily they expose LLMs to adversarial contexts. Our findings also reveal that "skeptical prompting" can activate LLMs' internal reasoning, enabling partial self-defense against adversarial passages, though its effectiveness depends strongly on the model's reasoning capacity. Together, our experiments (code available at https://github.com/JinyanSu1/eval_PoisonRaG) and analysis provide actionable insights for designing safer and more resilient RAG systems, paving the way for more reliable real-world deployments.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a comprehensive systematic review of RAG, tracing its evolution from early developments in open domain question answering to recent state-of-the-art implementations across diverse applications. The review begins by outlining the motivations behind RAG, particularly its ability to mitigate hallucinations and outdated knowledge in parametric models. Core technical components-retrieval mechanisms, sequence-to-sequence generation models, and fusion strategies are examined in detail. A year-by-year analysis highlights key milestones and research trends, providing insight into RAG's rapid growth. The paper further explores the deployment of RAG in enterprise systems, addressing practical challenges related to retrieval of proprietary data, security, and scalability. A comparative evaluation of RAG implementations is conducted, benchmarking performance on retrieval accuracy, generation fluency, latency, and computational efficiency. Persistent challenges such as retrieval quality, privacy concerns, and integration overhead are critically assessed. Finally, the review highlights emerging solutions, including hybrid retrieval approaches, privacy-preserving techniques, optimized fusion strategies, and agentic RAG architectures. These innovations point toward a future of more reliable, efficient, and context-aware knowledge-intensive NLP systems.</p></details> | 33 pages, 2 figures |

While context compression mitigates this issue, existing methods apply fixed compression rates, over-compressing simple queries or under-compressing complex ones. We propose Adaptive Context Compression for RAG (ACC-RAG), a framework that dynamically adjusts compression rates based on input complexity, optimizing inference efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. ACC-RAG combines a hierarchical compressor (for multi-granular embeddings) with a context selector to retain minimal sufficient information, akin to human skimming. Evaluated on Wikipedia and five QA datasets, ACC-RAG outperforms fixed-rate methods and matches/unlocks over 4 times faster inference versus standard RAG while maintaining or improving accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, this reliance on external sources exposes a security risk, attackers can inject poisoned documents into the knowledge base to steer the generation process toward harmful or misleading outputs. In this paper, we propose Gradient-based Masked Token Probability (GMTP), a novel defense method to detect and filter out adversarially crafted documents. Specifically, GMTP identifies high-impact tokens by examining gradients of the retriever's similarity function. These key tokens are then masked, and their probabilities are checked via a Masked Language Model (MLM). Since injected tokens typically exhibit markedly low masked-token probabilities, this enables GMTP to easily detect malicious documents and achieve high-precision filtering. Experiments demonstrate that GMTP is able to eliminate over 90% of poisoned content while retaining relevant documents, thus maintaining robust retrieval and generation performance across diverse datasets and adversarial settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, accepted to ACL Findings 2025</p></details> |

| **[Each to Their Own: Exploring the Optimal Embedding in RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17442v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, as Large Language Models (LLMs) have fundamentally impacted various fields, the methods for incorporating up-to-date information into LLMs or adding external knowledge to construct domain-specific models have garnered wide attention. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), serving as an inference-time scaling method, is notable for its low cost and minimal effort for parameter tuning. However, due to heterogeneous training data and model architecture, the variant embedding models used in RAG exhibit different benefits across various areas, often leading to different similarity calculation results and, consequently, varying response quality from LLMs. To address this problem, we propose and examine two approaches to enhance RAG by combining the benefits of multiple embedding models, named Mixture-Embedding RAG and Confident RAG. Mixture-Embedding RAG simply sorts and selects retrievals from multiple embedding models based on standardized similarity; however, it does not outperform vanilla RAG. In contrast, Confident RAG generates responses multiple times using different embedding models and then selects the responses with the highest confidence level, demonstrating average improvements of approximately 10% and 5% over vanilla LLMs and RAG, respectively. The consistent results across different LLMs and embedding models indicate that Confident RAG is an efficient plug-and-play approach for various domains. We will release our code upon publication.</p></details> |  |

LLMs have emerged as pioneering tools, providing robust support for various applications, including intelligent decision-making, user interaction, and real-time traffic analysis. As user demand for e-mobility continues to grow, delivering comprehensive end-to-end solutions has become crucial. In this paper, we present a cloud-based, LLM-powered shared e-mobility platform, integrated with a mobile application for personalized route recommendations. The optimization module is evaluated based on travel time and cost across different traffic scenarios. Additionally, the LLM-powered RAG framework is evaluated at the schema level for different users, using various evaluation methods. Schema-level RAG with XiYanSQL achieves an average execution accuracy of 0.81 on system operator queries and 0.98 on user queries.</p></details> |  |

| **[Agentic RAG with Knowledge Graphs for Complex Multi-Hop Reasoning in Real-World Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16507v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) but often fall short on complex queries, delivering limited, extractive answers and struggling with multiple targeted retrievals or navigating intricate entity relationships. This is a critical gap in knowledge-intensive domains. We introduce INRAExplorer, an agentic RAG system for exploring the scientific data of INRAE (France's National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment). INRAExplorer employs an LLM-based agent with a multi-tool architecture to dynamically engage a rich knowledge base, through a comprehensive knowledge graph derived from open access INRAE publications. This design empowers INRAExplorer to conduct iterative, targeted queries, retrieve exhaustive datasets (e.g., all publications by an author), perform multi-hop reasoning, and deliver structured, comprehensive answers. INRAExplorer serves as a concrete illustration of enhancing knowledge interaction in specialized fields.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECAI ...</summary><p>ECAI 2025 demo track, 4 pages</p></details> |
| **[KnowShiftQA: How Robust are RAG Systems when Textbook Knowledge Shifts in K-12 Education?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08985v4)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems show remarkable potential as question answering tools in the K-12 Education domain, where knowledge is typically queried within the restricted scope of authoritative textbooks. However, discrepancies between these textbooks and the parametric knowledge inherent in Large Language Models (LLMs) can undermine the effectiveness of RAG systems. To systematically investigate RAG system robustness against such knowledge discrepancies, we introduce KnowShiftQA. This novel question answering dataset simulates these discrepancies by applying deliberate hypothetical knowledge updates to both answers and source documents, reflecting how textbook knowledge can shift. KnowShiftQA comprises 3,005 questions across five subjects, designed with a comprehensive question typology focusing on context utilization and knowledge integration. Our extensive experiments on retrieval and question answering performance reveal that most RAG systems suffer a substantial performance drop when faced with these knowledge discrepancies. Furthermore, questions requiring the integration of contextual (textbook) knowledge with parametric (LLM) knowledge pose a significant challenge to current LLMs.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Main |
| **[Reading Between the Timelines: RAG for Answering Diachronic Questions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22917v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) excels at injecting static, factual knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs), it exhibits a critical deficit in handling longitudinal queries that require tracking entities and phenomena across time. This blind spot arises because conventional, semantically-driven retrieval methods are not equipped to gather evidence that is both topically relevant and temporally coherent for a specified duration. We address this challenge by proposing a new framework that fundamentally redesigns the RAG pipeline to infuse temporal logic. Our methodology begins by disentangling a user's query into its core subject and its temporal window. It then employs a specialized retriever that calibrates semantic matching against temporal relevance, ensuring the collection of a contiguous evidence set that spans the entire queried period. To enable rigorous evaluation of this capability, we also introduce the Analytical Diachronic Question Answering Benchmark (ADQAB), a challenging evaluation suite grounded in a hybrid corpus of real and synthetic financial news. Empirical results on ADQAB show that our approach yields substantial gains in answer accuracy, surpassing standard RAG implementations by 13% to 27%. This work provides a validated pathway toward RAG systems capable of performing the nuanced, evolutionary analysis required for complex, real-world questions. The dataset and code for this study are publicly available at https://github.com/kwunhang/TA-RAG.</p></details> |  |

Yet, a pressing challenge remains: How can we trust these agents especially in zero-shot settings with no fine-tuning? We introduce a novel modular Agentic AI visual classification framework that integrates generalist multimodal agents with a non-visual reasoning orchestrator and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module. Applied to apple leaf disease diagnosis, we benchmark three configurations: (I) zero-shot with confidence-based orchestration, (II) fine-tuned agents with improved performance, and (III) trust-calibrated orchestration enhanced by CLIP-based image retrieval and re-evaluation loops. Using confidence calibration metrics (ECE, OCR, CCC), the orchestrator modulates trust across agents. Our results demonstrate a 77.94\% accuracy improvement in the zero-shot setting using trust-aware orchestration and RAG, achieving 85.63\% overall. GPT-4o showed better calibration, while Qwen-2.5-VL displayed overconfidence. Furthermore, image-RAG grounded predictions with visually similar cases, enabling correction of agent overconfidence via iterative re-evaluation. The proposed system separates perception (vision agents) from meta-reasoning (orchestrator), enabling scalable and interpretable multi-agent AI. This blueprint is extensible to diagnostics, biology, and other trust-critical domains. All models, prompts, results, and system components including the complete software source code are openly released to support reproducibility, transparency, and community benchmarking at Github: https://github.com/Applied-AI-Research-Lab/Orchestrator-Agent-Trust</p></details> |  |
| **[RAG-based Architectures for Drug Side Effect Retrieval in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13822v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drug side effects are a major global health concern, necessitating advanced methods for their accurate detection and analysis. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising conversational interfaces, their inherent limitations, including reliance on black-box training data, susceptibility to hallucinations, and lack of domain-specific knowledge, hinder their reliability in specialized fields like pharmacovigilance. To address this gap, we propose two architectures: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG, which integrate comprehensive drug side effect knowledge into a Llama 3 8B language model. Through extensive evaluations on 19,520 drug side effect associations (covering 976 drugs and 3,851 side effect terms), our results demonstrate that GraphRAG achieves near-perfect accuracy in drug side effect retrieval. This framework offers a highly accurate and scalable solution, signifying a significant advancement in leveraging LLMs for critical pharmacovigilance applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[ASTRID -- An Automated and Scalable TRIaD for the Evaluation of RAG-based Clinical Question Answering Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08208v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive potential in clinical question answering (QA), with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) emerging as a leading approach for ensuring the factual accuracy of model responses. However, current automated RAG metrics perform poorly in clinical and conversational use cases. Using clinical human evaluations of responses is expensive, unscalable, and not conducive to the continuous iterative development of RAG systems. To address these challenges, we introduce ASTRID - an Automated and Scalable TRIaD for evaluating clinical QA systems leveraging RAG - consisting of three metrics: Context Relevance (CR), Refusal Accuracy (RA), and Conversational Faithfulness (CF). Our novel evaluation metric, CF, is designed to better capture the faithfulness of a model's response to the knowledge base without penalising conversational elements. To validate our triad, we curate a dataset of over 200 real-world patient questions posed to an LLM-based QA agent during surgical follow-up for cataract surgery - the highest volume operation in the world - augmented with clinician-selected questions for emergency, clinical, and non-clinical out-of-domain scenarios. We demonstrate that CF can predict human ratings of faithfulness better than existing definitions for conversational use cases. Furthermore, we show that evaluation using our triad consisting of CF, RA, and CR exhibits alignment with clinician assessment for inappropriate, harmful, or unhelpful responses. Finally, using nine different LLMs, we demonstrate that the three metrics can closely agree with human evaluations, highlighting the potential of these metrics for use in LLM-driven automated evaluation pipelines. We also publish the prompts and datasets for these experiments, providing valuable resources for further research and development.</p></details> | 29 pages |
| **[Secure Multifaceted-RAG for Enterprise: Hybrid Knowledge Retrieval with Security Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13425v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems face challenges in enterprise settings due to limited retrieval scope and data security risks. When relevant internal documents are unavailable, the system struggles to generate accurate and complete responses. Additionally, using closed-source Large Language Models (LLMs) raises concerns about exposing proprietary information. To address these issues, we propose the Secure Multifaceted-RAG (SecMulti-RAG) framework, which retrieves not only from internal documents but also from two supplementary sources: pre-generated expert knowledge for anticipated queries and on-demand external LLM-generated knowledge. To mitigate security risks, we adopt a local open-source generator and selectively utilize external LLMs only when prompts are deemed safe by a filtering mechanism. This approach enhances completeness, prevents data leakage, and reduces costs. In our evaluation on a report generation task in the automotive industry, SecMulti-RAG significantly outperforms traditional RAG - achieving 79.3 to 91.9 percent win rates across correctness, richness, and helpfulness in LLM-based evaluation, and 56.3 to 70.4 percent in human evaluation. This highlights SecMulti-RAG as a practical and secure solution for enterprise RAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-task retriever fine-tuning for domain-specific and efficient RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04652v2)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become ubiquitous when deploying Large Language Models (LLMs), as it can address typical limitations such as generating hallucinated or outdated information. However, when building real-world RAG applications, practical issues arise. First, the retrieved information is generally domain-specific. Since it is computationally expensive to fine-tune LLMs, it is more feasible to fine-tune the retriever to improve the quality of the data included in the LLM input. Second, as more applications are deployed in the same real-world system, one cannot afford to deploy separate retrievers. Moreover, these RAG applications normally retrieve different kinds of data. Our solution is to instruction fine-tune a small retriever encoder on a variety of domain-specific tasks to allow us to deploy one encoder that can serve many use cases, thereby achieving low-cost, scalability, and speed. We show how this encoder generalizes to out-of-domain settings as well as to an unseen retrieval task on real-world enterprise use cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures.

This survey synthesizes both strands under a unified reasoning-retrieval perspective. We first map how advanced reasoning optimizes each stage of RAG (Reasoning-Enhanced RAG). Then, we show how retrieved knowledge of different type supply missing premises and expand context for complex inference (RAG-Enhanced Reasoning). Finally, we spotlight emerging Synergized RAG-Reasoning frameworks, where (agentic) LLMs iteratively interleave search and reasoning to achieve state-of-the-art performance across knowledge-intensive benchmarks. We categorize methods, datasets, and open challenges, and outline research avenues toward deeper RAG-Reasoning systems that are more effective, multimodally-adaptive, trustworthy, and human-centric.

Improper retrieval settings can degrade performance, making RAG less reliable than closed-book generation. In this work, we introduce RAGGED, a framework for systematically evaluating RAG systems across diverse retriever-reader configurations, retrieval depths, and datasets. Our analysis reveals that reader robustness to noise is the key determinant of RAG stability and scalability. Some readers benefit from increased retrieval depth, while others degrade due to their sensitivity to distracting content. Through large-scale experiments on open-domain, multi-hop, and specialized-domain datasets, we show that retrievers, rerankers, and prompts influence performance but do not fundamentally alter these reader-driven trends. By providing a principled framework and new metrics to assess RAG stability and scalability, RAGGED enables systematic evaluation of retrieval-augmented generation systems, guiding future research on optimizing retrieval depth and model robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/neulab/ragged</p></details> |

Prior work either reduces the response delay (through better scheduling of RAG queries) or strives to maximize quality (which involves tuning the RAG workflow), but they fall short in optimizing the tradeoff between the delay and quality of RAG responses. This paper presents METIS, the first RAG system that jointly schedules queries and adapts the key RAG configurations of each query, such as the number of retrieved text chunks and synthesis methods, in order to balance quality optimization and response delay reduction. Using 4 popular RAG-QA datasets, we show that compared with the state-of-the-art RAG optimization schemes, METIS reduces the generation latency by $1.64-2.54\times$ without sacrificing generation quality.</p></details> | 17 pages, 18 figures |

While large language models (LLMs) offer potential for automating advisory tasks, most existing solutions remain limited to prototypes or synthetic benchmarks. MARAUS addresses this gap by combining hybrid retrieval, multi-agent orchestration, and LLM-based generation into a system tailored for real-world university admissions. In collaboration with the University of Transport Technology (UTT) in Hanoi, we conducted a two-phase study involving technical development and real-world evaluation. MARAUS processed over 6,000 actual user interactions, spanning six categories of queries. Results show substantial improvements over LLM-only baselines: on average 92 percent accuracy, hallucination rates reduced from 15 precent to 1.45 percent, and average response times below 4 seconds. The system operated cost-effectively, with a two-week deployment cost of 11.58 USD using GPT-4o mini. This work provides actionable insights for the deployment of agentic RAG systems in low-resource educational settings.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods have explored enhancing models' search and reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL). Although these methods demonstrate promising results, they face challenges in training stability and encounter issues such as substantial inference time and restricted capabilities due to the single-query mode. In this paper, we propose RAG-R1, a novel training framework designed to enable LLMs to adaptively leverage internal and external knowledge during the reasoning process. We further expand the generation and retrieval processes within the framework from single-query mode to multi-query parallelism, aimed at reducing inference time and enhancing the model's capabilities. Extensive experiments on seven question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the strongest baseline by up to 13.2% and decreases inference time by 11.1%.</p></details> |  |
| **[DRAGON: Dynamic RAG Benchmark On News](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05713v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a widely adopted approach for improving the factuality of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge at inference time. Although there exist multiple RAG benchmarks for English, evaluation resources for other languages, including Russian, remain scarce and static, failing to capture the dynamic nature of real-world deployments. In this work, we present DRAGON (Dynamic RAG Benchmark On News), the first dynamic benchmark for evaluating RAG systems in Russian on a changing news corpora. DRAGON is built upon a regularly updated corpus of Russian news and public documents and supports comprehensive evaluation of both the retriever and generator components. Question generation is performed automatically with the use of Knowledge Graph constructed from the corpus and enables the extraction of four core question types aligned with distinct subgraph patterns. We release a complete evaluation framework comprising the pipeline for automatic question generation, evaluation scripts, which are potentially reusable for other languages and multilingual settings, and benchmark data. We also launch a public leaderboard to encourage community participation and comparison.</p></details> |  |
| **[Am I on the Right Track? What Can Predicted Query Performance Tell Us about the Search Behaviour of Agentic RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10411v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a new paradigm where the reasoning model decides when to invoke a retriever (as a "tool") when answering a question. This paradigm, exemplified by recent research works such as Search-R1, enables the model to decide when to search and obtain external information. However, the queries generated by such Agentic RAG models and the role of the retriever in obtaining high-quality answers remain understudied. To this end, this initial study examines the applicability of query performance prediction (QPP) within the recent Agentic RAG models Search-R1 and R1-Searcher. We find that applying effective retrievers can achieve higher answer quality within a shorter reasoning process. Moreover, the QPP estimates of the generated queries, used as an approximation of their retrieval quality, are positively correlated with the quality of the final answer. Ultimately, our work is a step towards adaptive retrieval within Agentic RAG, where QPP is used to inform the model if the retrieved results are likely to be useful.</p></details> |  |

While classical machine learning models leverage structured socio-demographic and behavioral data, they often fail to capture the nuanced emotional and contextual factors embedded in unstructured student interactions. This paper introduces a transformative AI framework that redefines dropout prediction through three synergistic innovations: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for domain-specific sentiment analysis, prompt engineering to decode academic stressors,and cross-modal attention fusion to dynamically align textual, behavioral, and socio-demographic insights. By grounding sentiment analysis in a curated knowledge base of pedagogical content, our RAG-enhanced BERT model interprets student comments with unprecedented contextual relevance, while optimized prompts isolate indicators of academic distress (e.g., "isolation," "workload anxiety"). A cross-modal attention layer then fuses these insights with temporal engagement patterns, creating holistic risk pro-files. Evaluated on a longitudinal dataset of 4 423 students, the framework achieves 89% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.88, outperforming conventional models by 7% and reducing false negatives by 21%. Beyond prediction, the system generates interpretable interventions by retrieving contextually aligned strategies (e.g., mentorship programs for isolated learners). This work bridges the gap between predictive analytics and actionable pedagogy, offering a scalable solution to mitigate dropout risks in global education systems</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, 1 Algorithms, 17th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies,: 30 June-2 July, 2025 Location: Palma, Spain</p></details> |

We present a novel multimodal document chunking approach that leverages Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to process PDF documents in batches while maintaining semantic coherence and structural integrity. Our method processes documents in configurable page batches with cross-batch context preservation, enabling accurate handling of tables spanning multiple pages, embedded visual elements, and procedural content. We evaluate our approach on a curated dataset of PDF documents with manually crafted queries, demonstrating improvements in chunk quality and downstream RAG performance. Our vision-guided approach achieves better accuracy compared to traditional vanilla RAG systems, with qualitative analysis showing superior preservation of document structure and semantic coherence.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 1 Figure, 1 Table</p></details> |

However, its adoption is hindered by the complexity of policy languages and the risk of misconfigurations. In this work, we present ARPaCCino, an agentic system that combines Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG), and tool-based validation to automate the generation and verification of PaC rules. Given natural language descriptions of the desired policies, ARPaCCino generates formal Rego rules, assesses IaC compliance, and iteratively refines the IaC configurations to ensure conformance. Thanks to its modular agentic architecture and integration with external tools and knowledge bases, ARPaCCino supports policy validation across a wide range of technologies, including niche or emerging IaC frameworks. Experimental evaluation involving a Terraform-based case study demonstrates ARPaCCino's effectiveness in generating syntactically and semantically correct policies, identifying non-compliant infrastructures, and applying corrective modifications, even when using smaller, open-weight LLMs. Our results highlight the potential of agentic RAG architectures to enhance the automation, reliability, and accessibility of PaC workflows.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by incorporating external information, often from graph-structured data. However, existing graph-based RAG methods suffer from poor graph quality due to incomplete extraction and insufficient utilization of query information during retrieval. To overcome these limitations, we propose CUE-RAG, a novel approach that introduces (1) a multi-partite graph index incorporates text Chunks, knowledge Units, and Entities to capture semantic content at multiple levels of granularity, (2) a hybrid extraction strategy that reduces LLM token usage while still producing accurate and disambiguated knowledge units, and (3) Q-Iter, a query-driven iterative retrieval strategy that enhances relevance through semantic search and constrained graph traversal. Experiments on three QA benchmarks show that CUE-RAG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 99.33% higher Accuracy and 113.51% higher F1 score while reducing indexing costs by 72.58%. Remarkably, CUE-RAG matches or outperforms baselines even without using an LLM for indexing. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of CUE-RAG in advancing graph-based RAG systems.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances factual accuracy by integrating external sources, but it presents two key challenges. First, insufficient retrieval can miss critical information, whereas excessive retrieval can introduce irrelevant or misleading content, disrupting model output. Second, even when the model initially provides correct answers, over-reliance on retrieved data can lead to factual errors. To address these issues, we introduce the Multimodal Intelligent Retrieval and Augmentation (MIRA) framework, designed to optimize factual accuracy in MLLM. MIRA consists of two key components: (1) a calibrated Rethinking and Rearrangement module that dynamically adjusts the number of retrieved contexts to manage factual risk, and (2) A medical RAG framework integrating image embeddings and a medical knowledge base with a query-rewrite module for efficient multimodal reasoning. This enables the model to effectively integrate both its inherent knowledge and external references. Our evaluation of publicly available medical VQA and report generation benchmarks demonstrates that MIRA substantially enhances factual accuracy and overall performance, achieving new state-of-the-art results.

| **[SemRAG: Semantic Knowledge-Augmented RAG for Improved Question-Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21110v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces SemRAG, an enhanced Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that efficiently integrates domain-specific knowledge using semantic chunking and knowledge graphs without extensive fine-tuning. Integrating domain-specific knowledge into large language models (LLMs) is crucial for improving their performance in specialized tasks. Yet, existing adaptations are computationally expensive, prone to overfitting and limit scalability. To address these challenges, SemRAG employs a semantic chunking algorithm that segments documents based on the cosine similarity from sentence embeddings, preserving semantic coherence while reducing computational overhead. Additionally, by structuring retrieved information into knowledge graphs, SemRAG captures relationships between entities, improving retrieval accuracy and contextual understanding. Experimental results on MultiHop RAG and Wikipedia datasets demonstrate SemRAG has significantly enhances the relevance and correctness of retrieved information from the Knowledge Graph, outperforming traditional RAG methods. Furthermore, we investigate the optimization of buffer sizes for different data corpus, as optimizing buffer sizes tailored to specific datasets can further improve retrieval performance, as integration of knowledge graphs strengthens entity relationships for better contextual comprehension. The primary advantage of SemRAG is its ability to create an efficient, accurate domain-specific LLM pipeline while avoiding resource-intensive fine-tuning. This makes it a practical and scalable approach aligned with sustainability goals, offering a viable solution for AI applications in domain-specific fields.</p></details> | 16 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Multi-Head RAG: Solving Multi-Aspect Problems with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05085v4)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling the retrieval of documents into the LLM context to provide more accurate and relevant responses. Existing RAG solutions do not focus on queries that may require fetching multiple documents with substantially different contents. Such queries occur frequently, but are challenging because the embeddings of these documents may be distant in the embedding space, making it hard to retrieve them all. This paper introduces Multi-Head RAG (MRAG), a novel scheme designed to address this gap with a simple yet powerful idea: leveraging activations of Transformer's multi-head attention layer, instead of the decoder layer, as keys for fetching multi-aspect documents. The driving observation is that different attention heads learn to capture different data aspects. Harnessing the corresponding activations results in embeddings that represent various facets of data items and queries, improving the retrieval accuracy for complex queries. We provide an evaluation methodology and metrics, multi-aspect datasets, and real-world use cases to demonstrate MRAG's effectiveness. We show MRAG's design advantages over 18 RAG baselines, empirical improvements of up to 20% in retrieval success ratios, and benefits for downstream LLM generation. MRAG can be seamlessly integrated with existing RAG frameworks and benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Cross-Lingual Cost: Retrieval Biases in RAG over Arabic-English Corpora](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07543v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-lingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a critical capability for retrieving and generating answers across languages. Prior work in this context has mostly focused on generation and relied on benchmarks derived from open-domain sources, most notably Wikipedia. In such settings, retrieval challenges often remain hidden due to language imbalances, overlap with pretraining data, and memorized content. To address this gap, we study Arabic-English RAG in a domain-specific setting using benchmarks derived from real-world corporate datasets. Our benchmarks include all combinations of languages for the user query and the supporting document, drawn independently and uniformly at random. This enables a systematic study of multilingual retrieval behavior. Our findings reveal that retrieval is a critical bottleneck in cross-lingual domain-specific scenarios, with significant performance drops occurring when the user query and supporting document languages differ. A key insight is that these failures stem primarily from the retriever's difficulty in ranking documents across languages. Finally, we propose a simple retrieval strategy that addresses this source of failure by enforcing equal retrieval from both languages, resulting in substantial improvements in cross-lingual and overall performance. These results highlight meaningful opportunities for improving multilingual retrieval, particularly in practical, real-world RAG applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAG Safety: Exploring Knowledge Poisoning Attacks to Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08862v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by retrieving external data to mitigate hallucinations and outdated knowledge issues. Benefiting from the strong ability in facilitating diverse data sources and supporting faithful reasoning, knowledge graphs (KGs) have been increasingly adopted in RAG systems, giving rise to KG-based RAG (KG-RAG) methods. Though RAG systems are widely applied in various applications, recent studies have also revealed its vulnerabilities to data poisoning attacks, where malicious information injected into external knowledge sources can mislead the system into producing incorrect or harmful responses. However, these studies focus exclusively on RAG systems using unstructured textual data sources, leaving the security risks of KG-RAG largely unexplored, despite the fact that KGs present unique vulnerabilities due to their structured and editable nature. In this work, we conduct the first systematic investigation of the security issue of KG-RAG methods through data poisoning attacks. To this end, we introduce a practical, stealthy attack setting that aligns with real-world implementation. We propose an attack strategy that first identifies adversarial target answers and then inserts perturbation triples to complete misleading inference chains in the KG, increasing the likelihood that KG-RAG methods retrieve and rely on these perturbations during generation. Through extensive experiments on two benchmarks and four recent KG-RAG methods, our attack strategy demonstrates strong effectiveness in degrading KG-RAG performance, even with minimal KG perturbations. In-depth analyses are also conducted to understand the safety threats within the internal stages of KG-RAG systems and to explore the robustness of LLMs against adversarial knowledge.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

Retrievers encompass a multitude of hyperparameters that significantly impact performance outcomes and demonstrate sensitivity to specific applications. Nevertheless, hyperparameter optimization entails prohibitively high computational expenses. Existing evaluation methods suffer from either prohibitive costs or disconnection from domain-specific scenarios. This paper proposes SEARA (Subset sampling Evaluation for Automatic Retriever Assessment), which addresses evaluation data challenges through subset sampling techniques and achieves robust automated retriever evaluation by minimal retrieval facts extraction and comprehensive retrieval metrics. Based on real user queries, this method enables fully automated retriever evaluation at low cost, thereby obtaining optimal retriever for specific business scenarios. We validate our method across classic RAG applications in rednote, including knowledge-based Q&A system and retrieval-based travel assistant, successfully obtaining scenario-specific optimal retrievers.</p></details> |  |

This work addresses the Closed Visual Question Answering (CVQA) task, where the goal is to select the correct answer to multiple-choice clinical questions based on both user-submitted images and accompanying symptom descriptions. The proposed approach combines three core components: (1) fine-tuning open-source multimodal models from the Qwen, Gemma, and LLaMA families on the competition dataset, (2) introducing a structured reasoning layer that reconciles and adjudicates between candidate model outputs, and (3) incorporating agentic retrieval-augmented generation (agentic RAG), which adds relevant information from the American Academy of Dermatology's symptom and condition database to fill in gaps in patient context. The team achieved second place with a submission that scored sixth, demonstrating competitive performance and high accuracy. Beyond competitive benchmarks, this research addresses a practical challenge in telemedicine: diagnostic decisions must often be made asynchronously, with limited input and with high accuracy and interpretability. By emulating the systematic reasoning patterns employed by dermatologists when evaluating skin conditions, this architecture provided a pathway toward more reliable automated diagnostic support systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 ImageCLEF MEDIQA-MAGIC Challenge</p></details> |

However, RAG's reliance on ingesting external documents introduces new vulnerabilities. This paper exposes a critical security gap at the data loading stage, where malicious actors can stealthily corrupt RAG pipelines by exploiting document ingestion. We propose a taxonomy of 9 knowledge-based poisoning attacks and introduce two novel threat vectors -- Content Obfuscation and Content Injection -- targeting common formats (DOCX, HTML, PDF). Using an automated toolkit implementing 19 stealthy injection techniques, we test five popular data loaders, finding a 74.4% attack success rate across 357 scenarios. We further validate these threats on six end-to-end RAG systems -- including white-box pipelines and black-box services like NotebookLM and OpenAI Assistants -- demonstrating high success rates and critical vulnerabilities that bypass filters and silently compromise output integrity. Our results emphasize the urgent need to secure the document ingestion process in RAG systems against covert content manipulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>curre...</summary><p>currently under submission</p></details> |

In this paper, we explore and assess the feasibility of using traditional binary string features for MFC in the new era of large language models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Specifically, we investigate how Family-Specific String (FSS) features could be utilized in a manner similar to RAG to facilitate MFC. To this end, we develop a curated evaluation framework covering 4,347 samples from 67 malware families, extract and analyze over 25 million strings, and conduct detailed ablation studies to assess the impact of different design choices in four major modules.</p></details> |  |

However, existing retrieval systems predominantly focus on natural text-image matching and lack the capacity to address the diversity and ambiguity inherent in real-world educational scenarios. To address this limitation, we develop a lightweight and efficient multi-modal retrieval module, named Uni-Retrieval, which extracts query-style prototypes and dynamically matches them with tokens from a continually updated Prompt Bank. This Prompt Bank encodes and stores domain-specific knowledge by leveraging a Mixture-of-Expert Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE-LoRA) module and can be adapted to enhance Uni-Retrieval's capability to accommodate unseen query types at test time. To enable natural language educational content generation, we integrate the original Uni-Retrieval with a compact instruction-tuned language model, forming a complete retrieval-augmented generation pipeline named Uni-RAG. Given a style-conditioned query, Uni-RAG first retrieves relevant educational materials and then generates human-readable explanations, feedback, or instructional content aligned with the learning objective. Experimental results on SER and other multi-modal benchmarks show that Uni-RAG outperforms baseline retrieval and RAG systems in both retrieval accuracy and generation quality, while maintaining low computational cost. Our framework provides a scalable, pedagogically grounded solution for intelligent educational systems, bridging retrieval and generation to support personalized, explainable, and efficient learning assistance across diverse STEM scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Fair RAG: On the Impact of Fair Ranking in Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11598v4)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the central role of retrieval in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, much of the existing research on RAG overlooks the well-established field of fair ranking and fails to account for the interests of all stakeholders involved. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic evaluation of RAG systems that integrate fairness-aware rankings, addressing both ranking fairness and attribution fairness, which ensures equitable exposure of the sources cited in the generated content. Our evaluation focuses on measuring item-side fairness, specifically the fair exposure of relevant items retrieved by RAG systems, and investigates how this fairness impacts both the effectiveness of the systems and the attribution of sources in the generated output that users ultimately see. By experimenting with twelve RAG models across seven distinct tasks, we show that incorporating fairness-aware retrieval often maintains or even enhances both ranking quality and generation quality, countering the common belief that fairness compromises system performance. Additionally, we demonstrate that fair retrieval practices lead to more balanced attribution in the final responses, ensuring that the generator fairly cites the sources it relies on. Our findings underscore the importance of item-side fairness in retrieval and generation, laying the foundation for responsible and equitable RAG systems and guiding future research in fair ranking and attribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICTIR...</summary><p>ICTIR 2025 (Oral); NeurIPS 2024 AFME Workshop (Spotlight)</p></details> |

Within the ORAN architecture, Large Language Models (LLMs) can be specialized to generate xApps and rApps by leveraging specifications and API definitions from the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) platform. However, fine-tuning base LLMs for telecom-specific tasks remains expensive and resource-intensive. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a practical alternative through in-context learning, enabling domain adaptation without full retraining. While traditional RAG systems rely on vector-based retrieval, emerging variants such as GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG incorporate knowledge graphs or dual retrieval strategies to support multi-hop reasoning and improve factual grounding. Despite their promise, these methods lack systematic, metric-driven evaluations, particularly in high-stakes domains such as ORAN. In this study, we conduct a comparative evaluation of Vector RAG, GraphRAG, and Hybrid GraphRAG using ORAN specifications. We assess performance across varying question complexities using established generation metrics: faithfulness, answer relevance, context relevance, and factual correctness. Results show that both GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG outperform traditional RAG. Hybrid GraphRAG improves factual correctness by 8%, while GraphRAG improves context relevance by 7%.</p></details> |  |

National protocols and WHO recommendations are typically extensive and complex, making it difficult to extract precise information, especially during urgent situations. This project tackles that issue by developing a multilingual, intelligent question-answering system that transforms static vaccination guidelines into an interactive and user-friendly knowledge base. Built on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework and enhanced with agent-based reasoning (Agentic RAG), the system provides accurate, context-sensitive answers to complex medical queries. Evaluation shows that Agentic RAG outperforms traditional methods, particularly in addressing multi-step or ambiguous questions. To support clinical use, the system is integrated into a mobile application designed for real-time, point-of-care access to essential vaccine information.

| **[Efficient Knowledge Graph Construction and Retrieval from Unstructured Text for Large-Scale RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03226v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a scalable and cost-efficient framework for deploying Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) in enterprise environments. While GraphRAG has shown promise for multi-hop reasoning and structured retrieval, its adoption has been limited by the high computational cost of constructing knowledge graphs using large language models (LLMs) and the latency of graph-based retrieval. To address these challenges, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a dependency-based knowledge graph construction pipeline that leverages industrial-grade NLP libraries to extract entities and relations from unstructured text completely eliminating reliance on LLMs; and (2) a lightweight graph retrieval strategy that combines hybrid query node identification with efficient one-hop traversal for high-recall, low-latency subgraph extraction. We evaluate our framework on two SAP datasets focused on legacy code migration and demonstrate strong empirical performance. Our system achieves up to 15% and 4.35% improvements over traditional RAG baselines based on LLM-as-Judge and RAGAS metrics, respectively. Moreover, our dependency-based construction approach attains 94% of the performance of LLM-generated knowledge graphs (61.87% vs. 65.83%) while significantly reducing cost and improving scalability. These results validate the feasibility of deploying GraphRAG systems in real-world, large-scale enterprise applications without incurring prohibitive resource requirements paving the way for practical, explainable, and domain-adaptable retrieval-augmented reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[CyberRAG: An agentic RAG cyber attack classification and reporting tool](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02424v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) in large enterprises can generate hundreds of thousands of alerts per hour, overwhelming security analysts with logs that demand deep, rapidly evolving domain expertise. Conventional machine-learning detectors trim the alert volume but still yield high false-positive rates, while standard single-pass Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines often retrieve irrelevant context and fail to justify their predictions. To overcome these shortcomings, we present CyberRAG, a modular, agent-based RAG framework that delivers real-time classification, explanation, and structured reporting for cyber-attacks. A central LLM agent orchestrates (i) a pool of fine-tuned specialized classifiers, each tailored to a distinct attack family; (ii) tool adapters for enrichment and alerting; and (iii) an iterative retrieval-and-reason loop that continuously queries a domain-specific knowledge base until the evidence is both relevant and self-consistent. Unlike traditional RAG systems, CyberRAG embraces an agentic design that enables dynamic control flow and adaptive reasoning. This agent-centric architecture refines its threat labels and natural-language justifications autonomously, reducing false positives and enhancing interpretability. The framework is fully extensible: new attack types can be supported by simply adding a classifier without retraining the core agent. CyberRAG has been evaluated achieving over 94% accuracy per class and pushing final classification accuracy to 94.92% through semantic orchestration. Generated explanations score up to 0.94 in BERTScore and 4.9/5 in GPT-4-based expert evaluation. These results show that agentic, specialist-oriented RAG can pair high detection accuracy with trustworthy, SOC-ready prose, offering a practical and scalable path toward semi-autonomous cyber-defence workflows.</p></details> |  |

Existing vector search and RAG solutions largely assume abundant computation resources, making them impractical for on-device scenarios. In this paper, we propose MobileRAG, a fully on-device pipeline that overcomes these limitations by combining a mobile-friendly vector search algorithm, \textit{EcoVector}, with a lightweight \textit{Selective Content Reduction} (SCR) method. By partitioning and partially loading index data, EcoVector drastically reduces both memory footprint and CPU usage, while the SCR method filters out irrelevant text to diminish Language Model (LM) input size without degrading accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrated that MobileRAG significantly outperforms conventional vector search and RAG methods in terms of latency, memory usage, and power consumption, while maintaining accuracy and enabling offline operation to safeguard privacy in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | 14 pages |

However, complex tasks requiring multi-round retrieval remain challenging, and early attempts tend to be overly optimistic without a good sense of self-skepticism. Current multi-round RAG systems may continue searching even when enough information has already been retrieved, or they may provide incorrect answers without having sufficient information or knowledge. Existing solutions either require large amounts of expensive human-labeled process supervision data or lead to subpar performance. This paper aims to address these limitations by introducing a new framework, SIM-RAG, to explicitly enhance RAG systems' self-awareness and multi-round retrieval capabilities. To train SIM-RAG, we first let a RAG system self-practice multi-round retrieval, augmenting existing question-answer pairs with intermediate inner monologue reasoning steps to generate synthetic training data. For each pair, the system may explore multiple retrieval paths, which are labeled as successful if they reach the correct answer and unsuccessful otherwise. Using this data, we train a lightweight information sufficiency Critic. At inference time, the Critic evaluates whether the RAG system has retrieved sufficient information at each round, guiding retrieval decisions and improving system-level self-awareness through in-context reinforcement learning. Experiments across multiple prominent RAG benchmarks show that SIM-RAG is an effective multi-round RAG solution. Furthermore, this framework is system-efficient, adding a lightweight component to RAG without requiring modifications to existing LLMs or search engines, and data-efficient, eliminating the need for costly human-annotated mid-step retrieval process supervision data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 48th International ACM SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

While traditional flight control relies on hardcoded equations, recent Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential for more flexible problem-solving but struggle with reliably selecting and applying correct mathematical formulations and executing precise multi-step arithmetic. We propose RAG-UAV, a retrieval-augmented generation framework designed to improve the mathematical reasoning of several LLMs (including GPT o1/Turbo, Llama-3.2/3.3, Mistral, and DeepSeek R1) in UAV-specific contexts by providing access to relevant domain literature. To conduct an initial assessment, we introduce the UAV-Math-Bench, a 20-question problem set of UAV-centric mathematical problems across four difficulty levels. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating retrieval substantially increases exact answer accuracy (achieving up to 75% with o1), reduces instances of incorrect formulation selection (from 25% without RAG to 5\% with RAG), and decreases numerical errors, reducing Mean Squared Error (MSE) by orders of magnitude for the best-performing models. This pilot study indicates that RAG can enable general-purpose LLMs to function as more reliable tools for engineering analysis, although direct real-time flight control requires further investigation and validation on a larger scale. All benchmark data, questions, and answers are publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures, 4 appendix subsections</p></details> |

To mitigate these, recent methodologies have integrated information retrieved from external resources with LLMs, substantially enhancing their performance across NLP tasks. This survey paper addresses the absence of a comprehensive overview on Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RALMs), both Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Retrieval-Augmented Understanding (RAU), providing an in-depth examination of their paradigm, evolution, taxonomy, and applications. The paper discusses the essential components of RALMs, including Retrievers, Language Models, and Augmentations, and how their interactions lead to diverse model structures and applications. RALMs demonstrate utility in a spectrum of tasks, from translation and dialogue systems to knowledge-intensive applications. The survey includes several evaluation methods of RALMs, emphasizing the importance of robustness, accuracy, and relevance in their assessment. It also acknowledges the limitations of RALMs, particularly in retrieval quality and computational efficiency, offering directions for future research. In conclusion, this survey aims to offer a structured insight into RALMs, their potential, and the avenues for their future development in NLP.

The system is built on a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework, which integrates a curated knowledge base to ensure factual consistency. To enhance retrieval effectiveness across diverse question types, we implement a hybrid search strategy that combines dense vector similarity with sparse keyword-based retrieval. This dual-retrieval mechanism improves robustness for both general and domain-specific queries. The system includes a feedback loop in which students can rate responses and instructors can review and revise them. Instructor corrections are incorporated into the retrieval corpus, enabling adaptive refinement over time. The system was deployed in a classroom setting as a substitute for traditional office hours, where it successfully addressed a broad range of student queries. It was also used to provide technical support by integrating with a customer-specific knowledge base, demonstrating its ability to handle routine, context-sensitive tasks in applied domains.

However, LLMs often fail to faithfully integrate retrieved evidence into their generated responses, leading to factual inconsistencies. To quantify this gap, we introduce Entity-Context Divergence (ECD), a metric that measures the extent to which retrieved information is accurately reflected in model outputs. We systematically evaluate contemporary LLMs on their ability to preserve factual consistency in retrieval-augmented settings, a capability we define as RAG-ability. Our empirical analysis reveals that RAG-ability remains low across most LLMs, highlighting significant challenges in entity retention and context fidelity. This paper introduces Radiant (Retrieval AugmenteD entIty-context AligNmenT), a novel framework that merges RAG with alignment designed to optimize the interplay between retrieved evidence and generated content. Radiant extends Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to teach LLMs how to integrate provided additional information into subsequent generations. As a behavior correction mechanism, Radiant boosts RAG performance across varied retrieval scenarios, such as noisy web contexts, knowledge conflicts, and hallucination reduction. This enables more reliable, contextually grounded, and factually coherent content generation.</p></details> |  |

This research presents a complex framework that leverages Data Science methodologies, notably Large Language Models (LLM) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, to improve the efficiency of analyzing Calcutta High Court verdicts. Our framework focuses on two key aspects: first, the creation of a robust summarization mechanism that distills complex legal texts into concise and coherent summaries; and second, the development of an intelligent system for retrieving similar cases, which will assist legal professionals in research and decision making. By fine-tuning the Pegasus model using case head note summaries, we achieve significant improvements in the summarization of legal cases. Our two-step summarizing technique preserves crucial legal contexts, allowing for the production of a comprehensive vector database for RAG. The RAG-powered framework efficiently retrieves similar cases in response to user queries, offering thorough overviews and summaries. This technique not only improves legal research efficiency, but it also helps legal professionals and students easily acquire and grasp key legal information, benefiting the overall legal scenario.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Knowledge Augmented Finetuning Matters in both RAG and Agent Based Dialog Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22852v1)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to dialog systems. Despite making progress, LLMs are prone to errors in knowledge-intensive scenarios. Recently, approaches based on retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and agent have emerged to improve the factual accuracy by enhancing the LLMs with knowledge retrieved from external knowledge bases (KBs). This is mostly implemented by prompting the LLMs with instructions, examples and the retrieved knowledge. However, LLMs may have difficulty using the retrieved knowledge effectively for response generation, because they are not well trained to do such generation for specific domains. To mitigate this problem, we propose to finetune the LLMs in the RAG-based and agent-based systems with domain-specific data, together with domain-specific external knowledge, which is called knowledge augmented finetuning (KAFT). We base our study on the MobileCS2 dataset, a real-life customer service dialog dataset that features intensive knowledge interactions, to systematically compare the prompting and KAFT techniques in the RAG-based and agent-based systems. Experiment results show that KAFT substantially surpasses prompting in both RAG and agent systems, particularly in terms of factual accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this paper represents the first solid empirical work to investigate the KAFT idea.</p></details> |  |

However, there is a lack of empirical studies that report on the development of RAG-based implementations grounded in real-world use cases, evaluated through general user involvement, and accompanied by systematic documentation of lessons learned. This paper presents five domain-specific RAG applications developed for real-world scenarios across governance, cybersecurity, agriculture, industrial research, and medical diagnostics. Each system incorporates multilingual OCR, semantic retrieval via vector embeddings, and domain-adapted LLMs, deployed through local servers or cloud APIs to meet distinct user needs. A web-based evaluation involving a total of 100 participants assessed the systems across six dimensions: (i) Ease of Use, (ii) Relevance, (iii) Transparency, (iv) Responsiveness, (v) Accuracy, and (vi) Likelihood of Recommendation. Based on user feedback and our development experience, we documented twelve key lessons learned, highlighting technical, operational, and ethical challenges affecting the reliability and usability of RAG systems in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a full paper to the 51st Euromicro Conference on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications (SEAA 2025). 9 pages, 4 figures.

| **[MultiFinRAG: An Optimized Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Framework for Financial Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20821v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Financial documents--such as 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and investor presentations--span hundreds of pages and combine diverse modalities, including dense narrative text, structured tables, and complex figures. Answering questions over such content often requires joint reasoning across modalities, which strains traditional large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines due to token limitations, layout loss, and fragmented cross-modal context. We introduce MultiFinRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework purpose-built for financial QA. MultiFinRAG first performs multimodal extraction by grouping table and figure images into batches and sending them to a lightweight, quantized open-source multimodal LLM, which produces both structured JSON outputs and concise textual summaries. These outputs, along with narrative text, are embedded and indexed with modality-aware similarity thresholds for precise retrieval. A tiered fallback strategy then dynamically escalates from text-only to text+table+image contexts when necessary, enabling cross-modal reasoning while reducing irrelevant context. Despite running on commodity hardware, MultiFinRAG achieves 19 percentage points higher accuracy than ChatGPT-4o (free-tier) on complex financial QA tasks involving text, tables, images, and combined multimodal reasoning.</p></details> | Preprint Copy |
| **[CCRS: A Zero-Shot LLM-as-a-Judge Framework for Comprehensive RAG Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20128v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RAG systems enhance LLMs by incorporating external knowledge, which is crucial for domains that demand factual accuracy and up-to-date information. However, evaluating the multifaceted quality of RAG outputs, spanning aspects such as contextual coherence, query relevance, factual correctness, and informational completeness, poses significant challenges. Existing evaluation methods often rely on simple lexical overlap metrics, which are inadequate for capturing these nuances, or involve complex multi-stage pipelines with intermediate steps like claim extraction or require finetuning specialized judge models, hindering practical efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose CCRS (Contextual Coherence and Relevance Score), a novel suite of five metrics that utilizes a single, powerful, pretrained LLM as a zero-shot, end-to-end judge. CCRS evaluates: Contextual Coherence (CC), Question Relevance (QR), Information Density (ID), Answer Correctness (AC), and Information Recall (IR). We apply CCRS to evaluate six diverse RAG system configurations on the challenging BioASQ dataset. Our analysis demonstrates that CCRS effectively discriminates between system performances, confirming, for instance, that the Mistral-7B reader outperforms Llama variants. We provide a detailed analysis of CCRS metric properties, including score distributions, convergent/discriminant validity, tie rates, population statistics, and discriminative power. Compared to the complex RAGChecker framework, CCRS offers comparable or superior discriminative power for key aspects like recall and faithfulness, while being significantly more computationally efficient. CCRS thus provides a practical, comprehensive, and efficient framework for evaluating and iteratively improving RAG systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at LLM4Eval @ SIGIR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Controlled Retrieval-augmented Context Evaluation for Long-form RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20051v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models by incorporating context retrieved from external knowledge sources. While the effectiveness of the retrieval module is typically evaluated with relevance-based ranking metrics, such metrics may be insufficient to reflect the retrieval's impact on the final RAG result, especially in long-form generation scenarios. We argue that providing a comprehensive retrieval-augmented context is important for long-form RAG tasks like report generation and propose metrics for assessing the context independent of generation. We introduce CRUX, a \textbf{C}ontrolled \textbf{R}etrieval-a\textbf{U}gmented conte\textbf{X}t evaluation framework designed to directly assess retrieval-augmented contexts. This framework uses human-written summaries to control the information scope of knowledge, enabling us to measure how well the context covers information essential for long-form generation. CRUX uses question-based evaluation to assess RAG's retrieval in a fine-grained manner. Empirical results show that CRUX offers more reflective and diagnostic evaluation. Our findings also reveal substantial room for improvement in current retrieval methods, pointing to promising directions for advancing RAG's retrieval. Our data and code are publicly available to support and advance future research on retrieval.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, we propose Temporal Causal Probabilistic Description Logic (T-CPDL), an integrated framework that extends traditional Description Logic with temporal interval operators, explicit causal relationships, and probabilistic annotations. We present two distinct variants of T-CPDL: one capturing qualitative temporal relationships through Allen's interval algebra, and another variant enriched with explicit timestamped causal assertions. Both variants share a unified logical structure, enabling complex reasoning tasks ranging from simple temporal ordering to nuanced probabilistic causation. Empirical evaluations on temporal reasoning and causal inference benchmarks confirm that T-CPDL substantially improves inference accuracy, interpretability, and confidence calibration of language model outputs. By delivering transparent reasoning paths and fine-grained temporal and causal semantics, T-CPDL significantly enhances the capability of language models to support robust, explainable, and trustworthy decision-making. This work also lays the groundwork for developing advanced Logic-Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Logic-RAG) frameworks, potentially boosting the reasoning capabilities and efficiency of knowledge graph-enhanced RAG systems.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we introduce a modular AI system that leverages a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to automate standard applicability determination. Given a free-text device description, our system retrieves candidate standards from a curated corpus and uses large language models to infer jurisdiction-specific applicability, classified as Mandatory, Recommended, or Not Applicable, with traceable justifications. We construct an international benchmark dataset of medical device descriptions with expert-annotated standard mappings, and evaluate our system against retrieval-only, zero-shot, and rule-based baselines. The proposed approach attains a classification accuracy of 73% and a Top-5 retrieval recall of 87%, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying relevant regulatory standards. We introduce the first end-to-end system for standard applicability reasoning, enabling scalable and interpretable AI-supported regulatory science. Notably, our region-aware RAG agent performs cross-jurisdictional reasoning between Chinese and U.S. standards, supporting conflict resolution and applicability justification across regulatory frameworks.</p></details> |  |

We introduce PreQRAG, a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture designed to improve retrieval and generation quality through targeted question preprocessing. PreQRAG incorporates a pipeline that first classifies each input question as either single-document or multi-document type. For single-document questions, we employ question rewriting techniques to improve retrieval precision and generation relevance. For multi-document questions, we decompose complex queries into focused sub-questions that can be processed more effectively by downstream components. This classification and rewriting strategy improves the RAG performance. Experimental evaluation of the LiveRAG Challenge dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of our question-type-aware architecture, with PreQRAG achieving the preliminary second place in Session 2 of the LiveRAG challenge.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG</p></details> |

While RAG systems aim to leverage such communications as a knowledge base, their effectiveness is limited by raw data challenges: support tickets are typically noisy, inconsistent, and incomplete, making direct retrieval suboptimal. Unlike existing RAG approaches that focus on runtime optimization, we introduce a novel offline-first methodology that transforms these communications into a structured knowledge base. Our key innovation is a LLMs-based multi-agent system orchestrating three specialized agents: Category Discovery for taxonomy creation, Categorization for ticket grouping, and Knowledge Synthesis for article generation. Applying our methodology to real-world support tickets with resolution notes and comments, our system creates a compact knowledge base - reducing total volume to just 3.4% of original ticket data while improving quality. Experiments demonstrate that our prebuilt knowledge base in RAG systems significantly outperforms traditional RAG implementations (48.74% vs. 38.60% helpful answers) and achieves a 77.4% reduction in unhelpful responses. By automating institutional knowledge capture that typically remains siloed in experts' heads, our solution translates to substantial operational efficiency: reducing support workload, accelerating resolution times, and creating self-improving systems that automatically resolve approximately 50% of future supply chain tickets. Our approach addresses a key gap in knowledge management by transforming transient communications into structured, reusable knowledge through intelligent offline processing rather than latency-inducing runtime architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted In Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on AI for Supply Chain: Today and Future @ 31st ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining V.2 (KDD 25), August 3, 2025, Toronto, ON, Canada.

However, they also exhibit inherent limitations, such as outdated knowledge and susceptibility to hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm to address these issues, but it also introduces new vulnerabilities. Recent efforts have focused on the security of RAG-based LLMs, yet existing attack methods face three critical challenges: (1) their effectiveness declines sharply when only a limited number of poisoned texts can be injected into the knowledge database, (2) they lack sufficient stealth, as the attacks are often detectable by anomaly detection systems, which compromises their effectiveness, and (3) they rely on heuristic approaches to generate poisoned texts, lacking formal optimization frameworks and theoretic guarantees, which limits their effectiveness and applicability. To address these issues, we propose coordinated Prompt-RAG attack (PR-attack), a novel optimization-driven attack that introduces a small number of poisoned texts into the knowledge database while embedding a backdoor trigger within the prompt. When activated, the trigger causes the LLM to generate pre-designed responses to targeted queries, while maintaining normal behavior in other contexts. This ensures both high effectiveness and stealth. We formulate the attack generation process as a bilevel optimization problem leveraging a principled optimization framework to develop optimal poisoned texts and triggers. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PR-Attack, achieving a high attack success rate even with a limited number of poisoned texts and significantly improved stealth compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

Given the challenges in continual learning with large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become the dominant way to introduce new information. However, its reliance on vector retrieval hinders its ability to mimic the dynamic and interconnected nature of human long-term memory. Recent RAG approaches augment vector embeddings with various structures like knowledge graphs to address some of these gaps, namely sense-making and associativity. However, their performance on more basic factual memory tasks drops considerably below standard RAG. We address this unintended deterioration and propose HippoRAG 2, a framework that outperforms standard RAG comprehensively on factual, sense-making, and associative memory tasks. HippoRAG 2 builds upon the Personalized PageRank algorithm used in HippoRAG and enhances it with deeper passage integration and more effective online use of an LLM. This combination pushes this RAG system closer to the effectiveness of human long-term memory, achieving a 7% improvement in associative memory tasks over the state-of-the-art embedding model while also exhibiting superior factual knowledge and sense-making memory capabilities. This work paves the way for non-parametric continual learning for LLMs. Code and data are available at https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/HippoRAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025.

However, numerous methodologies frequently neglect the calibration capabilities of large language models (LLMs), which capitalize on their robust in-context reasoning prowess. This work illustrates that providing LLMs with specific cues substantially improves their calibration efficacy, especially in multi-round calibrations. We present a new SGIC: Self-Guided Iterative Calibration Framework that employs uncertainty scores as a tool. Initially, this framework calculates uncertainty scores to determine both the relevance of each document to the query and the confidence level in the responses produced by the LLMs. Subsequently, it reevaluates these scores iteratively, amalgamating them with prior responses to refine calibration. Furthermore, we introduce an innovative approach for constructing an iterative self-calibration training set, which optimizes LLMs to efficiently harness uncertainty scores for capturing critical information and enhancing response accuracy. Our proposed framework significantly improves performance on both closed-source and open-weight LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Legal texts are characterized by a predefined hierarchical structure, an extensive network of references and a continuous evolution through multiple temporal versions. This temporal dynamism poses a significant challenge for standard AI systems, demanding a deterministic representation of the law at any given point in time. To address this, our approach grounds the knowledge graph construction in a formal, FRBRoo-inspired model that distinguishes abstract legal works from their concrete textual expressions. We introduce a multi-layered representation of Temporal Versions (capturing date-specific changes) and Language Versions (capturing linguistic variations). By modeling normative evolution as a precise sequence of these versioned entities, we enable the construction of a knowledge graph that serves as a verifiable "ground truth". This allows Large Language Models to generate responses based on accurate, context-aware, and point-in-time correct legal information, overcoming the risk of temporal inaccuracies. Through a detailed analysis of this formal Graph RAG approach and its application to legal norm datasets, this article aims to advance the field of Artificial Intelligence applied to Law, creating opportunities for more effective and reliable systems in legal research, legislative analysis, and decision support.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version enhances the theoretical underpinnings of the proposed Graph RAG methodology, including the introduction of a formal, FRBRoo-based model for versioning, and enabling multi-language support for both content and metadata</p></details> |

It shows that LLMs struggle to capture the root causes of vulnerabilities during vulnerability detection. To address this challenge, we propose enhancing LLMs with multi-dimensional vulnerability knowledge distilled from historical vulnerabilities and fixes. We design a novel knowledge-level Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework Vul-RAG, which improves LLMs with an accuracy increase of 16% - 24% in identifying vulnerable and patched code. Additionally, vulnerability knowledge generated by Vul-RAG can further (1) serve as high-quality explanations to improve manual detection accuracy (from 60% to 77%), and (2) detect 10 previously-unknown bugs in the recent Linux kernel release with 6 assigned CVEs.</p></details> |  |

While large language models (LLMs) facilitate dynamic pedagogical interactions, hallucinations undermine confidence, trust, and instructional value. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) grounds LLM outputs in curated knowledge but requires a clear semantic link between user input and a knowledge base, which is often weak in student dialogue. We propose log-contextualized RAG (LC-RAG), which enhances RAG retrieval by using environment logs to contextualize collaborative discourse. Our findings show that LC-RAG improves retrieval over a discourse-only baseline and allows our collaborative peer agent, Copa, to deliver relevant, personalized guidance that supports students' critical thinking and epistemic decision-making in a collaborative computational modeling environment, C2STEM.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED25) Workshop on Epistemics and Decision-Making in AI-Supported Education</p></details> |

When a user submits a query, RAG executes a vector search to find relevant documents, which are then used to generate a response. However, ensuring the relevance of retrieved documents with a query would be a big challenge. To address this, a secondary model, known as a relevant grader, can be served to verify its relevance. To reduce computational requirements of a relevant grader, a lightweight small language model is preferred. In this work, we finetuned llama-3.2-1b as a relevant grader and achieved a significant increase in precision from 0.1301 to 0.7750. Its precision is comparable to that of llama-3.1-70b.

While RDF/OWL reasoners enable graph-based reasoning, they are limited to fragments of first-order logic, preventing deeper temporal and semantic analysis. This paper addresses both challenges by developing automatic historical event extraction models using multiple LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Llama 3.2) with three enhancement strategies: pure base generation, knowledge graph enhancement, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). We conducted comprehensive evaluations using historical texts from Thucydides. Our findings reveal that enhancement strategies optimize different performance dimensions rather than providing universal improvements. For coverage and historical breadth, base generation achieves optimal performance with Claude and GPT-4 extracting comprehensive events. However, for precision, RAG enhancement improves coordinate accuracy and metadata completeness. Model architecture fundamentally determines enhancement sensitivity: larger models demonstrate robust baseline performance with incremental RAG improvements, while Llama 3.2 shows extreme variance from competitive performance to complete failure. We then developed an automated translation pipeline converting extracted RDF representations into Coq proof assistant specifications, enabling higher-order reasoning beyond RDF capabilities including multi-step causal verification, temporal arithmetic with BC dates, and formal proofs about historical causation. The Coq formalization validates that RAG-discovered event types represent legitimate domain-specific semantic structures rather than ontological violations.</p></details> |  |

Traditional RAG pipelines often suffer from high latency and limited accuracy over massive, diverse datasets. DoTA-RAG addresses these challenges with a three-stage pipeline: query rewriting, dynamic routing to specialized sub-indexes, and multi-stage retrieval and ranking. We further enhance retrieval by evaluating and selecting a superior embedding model, re-embedding the large FineWeb-10BT corpus. Moreover, we create a diverse Q&A dataset of 500 questions generated via the DataMorgana setup across a broad range of WebOrganizer topics and formats. DoTA-RAG improves the answer correctness score from 0.752 (baseline, using LiveRAG pre-built vector store) to 1.478 while maintaining low latency, and it achieves a 0.929 correctness score on the Live Challenge Day.

Current approaches to supporting research idea generation often rely on generic large language models (LLMs). While LLMs are effective at aiding comprehension and summarization, they often fall short in guiding users toward practical research ideas due to their limitations. In this study, we present a novel structural framework for research ideation. Our framework, The Budget AI Researcher, uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) chains, vector databases, and topic-guided pairing to recombine concepts from hundreds of machine learning papers. The system ingests papers from nine major AI conferences, which collectively span the vast subfields of machine learning, and organizes them into a hierarchical topic tree. It uses the tree to identify distant topic pairs, generate novel research abstracts, and refine them through iterative self-evaluation against relevant literature and peer reviews, generating and refining abstracts that are both grounded in real-world research and demonstrably interesting. Experiments using LLM-based metrics indicate that our method significantly improves the concreteness of generated research ideas relative to standard prompting approaches. Human evaluations further demonstrate a substantial enhancement in the perceived interestingness of the outputs. By bridging the gap between academic data and creative generation, the Budget AI Researcher offers a practical, free tool for accelerating scientific discovery and lowering the barrier for aspiring researchers. Beyond research ideation, this approach inspires solutions to the broader challenge of generating personalized, context-aware outputs grounded in evolving real-world knowledge.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inten...</summary><p>Intended for AAAI's AI4Research Workshop</p></details> |

Data augmentation can potentially alleviate the data shortage, but augmenting vulnerable code is challenging and requires a generative solution that maintains vulnerability. Previous works have only focused on generating samples that contain single statements or specific types of vulnerabilities. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to solve various code generation and comprehension tasks with inspiring results, especially when fused with retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Therefore, we propose VulScribeR, a novel LLM-based solution that leverages carefully curated prompt templates to augment vulnerable datasets. More specifically, we explore three strategies to augment both single and multi-statement vulnerabilities, with LLMs, namely Mutation, Injection, and Extension. Our extensive evaluation across four vulnerability datasets and DLVD models, using three LLMs, show that our approach beats two SOTA methods Vulgen and VGX, and Random Oversampling (ROS) by 27.48%, 27.93%, and 15.41% in f1-score with 5K generated vulnerable samples on average, and 53.84%, 54.10%, 69.90%, and 40.93% with 15K generated vulnerable samples. Our approach demonstrates its feasibility for large-scale data augmentation by generating 1K samples at as cheap as US$ 1.88.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables, 3 prompt templates, 1 algorithm</p></details> |
| **[Bias Amplification in RAG: Poisoning Knowledge Retrieval to Steer LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11415v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Large Language Models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems can significantly enhance the performance of large language models by integrating external knowledge. However, RAG also introduces new security risks. Existing research focuses mainly on how poisoning attacks in RAG systems affect model output quality, overlooking their potential to amplify model biases. For example, when querying about domestic violence victims, a compromised RAG system might preferentially retrieve documents depicting women as victims, causing the model to generate outputs that perpetuate gender stereotypes even when the original query is gender neutral. To show the impact of the bias, this paper proposes a Bias Retrieval and Reward Attack (BRRA) framework, which systematically investigates attack pathways that amplify language model biases through a RAG system manipulation. We design an adversarial document generation method based on multi-objective reward functions, employ subspace projection techniques to manipulate retrieval results, and construct a cyclic feedback mechanism for continuous bias amplification. Experiments on multiple mainstream large language models demonstrate that BRRA attacks can significantly enhance model biases in dimensions. In addition, we explore a dual stage defense mechanism to effectively mitigate the impacts of the attack. This study reveals that poisoning attacks in RAG systems directly amplify model output biases and clarifies the relationship between RAG system security and model fairness. This novel potential attack indicates that we need to keep an eye on the fairness issues of the RAG system.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities to automate this translation. However, existing models still struggle with understanding domain-specific syntax and semantics. To enhance LLM performance in NL2SVA, we propose a customized retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework and a synthetic fine-tuning dataset that together improve LLM's performance. To further improve lightweight models over NL2SVA, our fine-tuning dataset provides prompt-guided explanations that teach LLMs the layer-by-layer construction process of concurrent SVAs, enabling supervised fine-tuning that greatly improves syntax and functionality accuracy. To evaluate the performance of LLMs over NL2SVA, we construct the largest evaluation dataset for NL2SVA, comprising 40 Verilog designs and 229 formally verified SVAs with detailed annotations. Experimental results show that our customized RAG framework increases the number of functionality matched SVAs by 58.42% over GPT-4o-mini, while Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct fine-tuned on our fine-tuning dataset and integrated with HybridRetrieval achieves a 59.05% over the base Qwen model.</p></details> |  |

| **[Assessing RAG and HyDE on 1B vs. 4B-Parameter Gemma LLMs for Personal Assistants Integretion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21568v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Resource efficiency is a critical barrier to deploying large language models (LLMs) in edge and privacy-sensitive applications. This study evaluates the efficacy of two augmentation strategies--Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE)--on compact Gemma LLMs of 1 billion and 4 billion parameters, within the context of a privacy-first personal assistant. We implement short-term memory via MongoDB and long-term semantic storage via Qdrant, orchestrated through FastAPI and LangChain, and expose the system through a React.js frontend. Across both model scales, RAG consistently reduces latency by up to 17\% and eliminates factual hallucinations when responding to user-specific and domain-specific queries. HyDE, by contrast, enhances semantic relevance--particularly for complex physics prompts--but incurs a 25--40\% increase in response time and a non-negligible hallucination rate in personal-data retrieval. Comparing 1 B to 4 B models, we observe that scaling yields marginal throughput gains for baseline and RAG pipelines, but magnifies HyDE's computational overhead and variability. Our findings position RAG as the pragmatic choice for on-device personal assistants powered by small-scale LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report as part of research project</p></details> |
| **[Reasoning RAG via System 1 or System 2: A Survey on Reasoning Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Industry Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10408v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful framework to overcome the knowledge limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external retrieval with language generation. While early RAG systems based on static pipelines have shown effectiveness in well-structured tasks, they struggle in real-world scenarios requiring complex reasoning, dynamic retrieval, and multi-modal integration. To address these challenges, the field has shifted toward Reasoning Agentic RAG, a paradigm that embeds decision-making and adaptive tool use directly into the retrieval process. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of Reasoning Agentic RAG methods, categorizing them into two primary systems: predefined reasoning, which follows fixed modular pipelines to boost reasoning, and agentic reasoning, where the model autonomously orchestrates tool interaction during inference. We analyze representative techniques under both paradigms, covering architectural design, reasoning strategies, and tool coordination. Finally, we discuss key research challenges and propose future directions to advance the flexibility, robustness, and applicability of reasoning agentic RAG systems. Our collection of the relevant research has been organized into a https://github.com/ByebyeMonica/Reasoning-Agentic-RAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[KG-Infused RAG: Augmenting Corpus-Based RAG with External Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09542v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves factual accuracy by grounding responses in external knowledge. However, existing methods typically rely on a single source, either unstructured text or structured knowledge. Moreover, they lack cognitively inspired mechanisms for activating relevant knowledge. To address these issues, we propose KG-Infused RAG, a framework that integrates KGs into RAG systems to implement spreading activation, a cognitive process that enables concept association and inference. KG-Infused RAG retrieves KG facts, expands the query accordingly, and enhances generation by combining corpus passages with structured facts, enabling interpretable, multi-source retrieval grounded in semantic structure. We further improve KG-Infused RAG via preference learning on sampled key stages in the pipeline. Experiments on five QA benchmarks show that KG-Infused RAG consistently outperforms vanilla RAG (by 3.8% to 13.8%). Additionally, when integrated into Self-RAG, KG-Infused RAG brings further performance gains, demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility as a plug-and-play enhancement module for corpus-based RAG methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[CiteFix: Enhancing RAG Accuracy Through Post-Processing Citation Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15629v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful application of Large Language Models (LLMs), revolutionizing information search and consumption. RAG systems combine traditional search capabilities with LLMs to generate comprehensive answers to user queries, ideally with accurate citations. However, in our experience of developing a RAG product, LLMs often struggle with source attribution, aligning with other industry studies reporting citation accuracy rates of only about 74% for popular generative search engines. To address this, we present efficient post-processing algorithms to improve citation accuracy in LLM-generated responses, with minimal impact on latency and cost. Our approaches cross-check generated citations against retrieved articles using methods including keyword + semantic matching, fine tuned model with BERTScore, and a lightweight LLM-based technique. Our experimental results demonstrate a relative improvement of 15.46% in the overall accuracy metrics of our RAG system. This significant enhancement potentially enables a shift from our current larger language model to a relatively smaller model that is approximately 12x more cost-effective and 3x faster in inference time, while maintaining comparable performance. This research contributes to enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of AI-generated content in information retrieval and summarization tasks which is critical to gain customer trust especially in commercial products.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safeguarding Multimodal Knowledge Copyright in the RAG-as-a-Service Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10030v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) evolves into service-oriented platforms (Rag-as-a-Service) with shared knowledge bases, protecting the copyright of contributed data becomes essential. Existing watermarking methods in RAG focus solely on textual knowledge, leaving image knowledge unprotected. In this work, we propose AQUA, the first watermark framework for image knowledge protection in Multimodal RAG systems. AQUA embeds semantic signals into synthetic images using two complementary methods: acronym-based triggers and spatial relationship cues. These techniques ensure watermark signals survive indirect watermark propagation from image retriever to textual generator, being efficient, effective and imperceptible. Experiments across diverse models and datasets show that AQUA enables robust, stealthy, and reliable copyright tracing, filling a key gap in multimodal RAG protection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why Uncertainty Estimation Methods Fall Short in RAG: An Axiomatic Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07459v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are valued for their strong performance across various tasks, but they also produce inaccurate or misleading outputs. Uncertainty Estimation (UE) quantifies the model's confidence and helps users assess response reliability. However, existing UE methods have not been thoroughly examined in scenarios like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), where the input prompt includes non-parametric knowledge. This paper shows that current UE methods cannot reliably assess correctness in the RAG setting. We further propose an axiomatic framework to identify deficiencies in existing methods and guide the development of improved approaches. Our framework introduces five constraints that an effective UE method should meet after incorporating retrieved documents into the LLM's prompt. Experimental results reveal that no existing UE method fully satisfies all the axioms, explaining their suboptimal performance in RAG. We further introduce a simple yet effective calibration function based on our framework, which not only satisfies more axioms than baseline methods but also improves the correlation between uncertainty estimates and correctness.</p></details> |  |
| **[ScIRGen: Synthesize Realistic and Large-Scale RAG Dataset for Scientific Research](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11117v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific researchers need intensive information about datasets to effectively evaluate and develop theories and methodologies. The information needs regarding datasets are implicitly embedded in particular research tasks, rather than explicitly expressed in search queries. However, existing scientific retrieval and question-answering (QA) datasets typically address straightforward questions, which do not align with the distribution of real-world research inquiries. To bridge this gap, we developed ScIRGen, a dataset generation framework for scientific QA \& retrieval that more accurately reflects the information needs of professional science researchers, and uses it to create a large-scale scientific retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) dataset with realistic queries, datasets and papers. Technically, we designed a dataset-oriented information extraction method that leverages academic papers to augment the dataset representation. We then proposed a question generation framework by employing cognitive taxonomy to ensure the quality of synthesized questions. We also design a method to automatically filter synthetic answers based on the perplexity shift of LLMs, which is highly aligned with human judgment of answers' validity. Collectively, these methodologies culminated in the creation of the 61k QA dataset, ScIRGen-Geo. We benchmarked representative methods on the ScIRGen-Geo dataset for their question-answering and retrieval capabilities, finding out that current methods still suffer from reasoning from complex questions. This work advances the development of more sophisticated tools to support the intricate information needs of the scientific community.</p></details> | KDD 2025 Accepted |
| **[GaRAGe: A Benchmark with Grounding Annotations for RAG Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07671v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present GaRAGe, a large RAG benchmark with human-curated long-form answers and annotations of each grounding passage, allowing a fine-grained evaluation of whether LLMs can identify relevant grounding when generating RAG answers. Our benchmark contains 2366 questions of diverse complexity, dynamism, and topics, and includes over 35K annotated passages retrieved from both private document sets and the Web, to reflect real-world RAG use cases. This makes it an ideal test bed to evaluate an LLM's ability to identify only the relevant information necessary to compose a response, or provide a deflective response when there is insufficient information. Evaluations of multiple state-of-the-art LLMs on GaRAGe show that the models tend to over-summarise rather than (a) ground their answers strictly on the annotated relevant passages (reaching at most a Relevance-Aware Factuality Score of 60%), or (b) deflect when no relevant grounding is available (reaching at most 31% true positive rate in deflections). The F1 in attribution to relevant sources is at most 58.9%, and we show that performance is particularly reduced when answering time-sensitive questions and when having to draw knowledge from sparser private grounding sources.</p></details> | ACL 2025 (Findings) |
| **[LlamaRec-LKG-RAG: A Single-Pass, Learnable Knowledge Graph-RAG Framework for LLM-Based Ranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07449v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven their adoption in recommender systems through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks. However, existing RAG approaches predominantly rely on flat, similarity-based retrieval that fails to leverage the rich relational structure inherent in user-item interactions. We introduce LlamaRec-LKG-RAG, a novel single-pass, end-to-end trainable framework that integrates personalized knowledge graph context into LLM-based recommendation ranking. Our approach extends the LlamaRec architecture by incorporating a lightweight user preference module that dynamically identifies salient relation paths within a heterogeneous knowledge graph constructed from user behavior and item metadata. These personalized subgraphs are seamlessly integrated into prompts for a fine-tuned Llama-2 model, enabling efficient and interpretable recommendations through a unified inference step. Comprehensive experiments on ML-100K and Amazon Beauty datasets demonstrate consistent and significant improvements over LlamaRec across key ranking metrics (MRR, NDCG, Recall). LlamaRec-LKG-RAG demonstrates the critical value of structured reasoning in LLM-based recommendations and establishes a foundation for scalable, knowledge-aware personalization in next-generation recommender systems. Code is available at~\href{https://github.com/VahidAz/LlamaRec-LKG-RAG}{repository}.</p></details> |  |
| **[MrM: Black-Box Membership Inference Attacks against Multimodal RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07399v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems enhance large vision-language models by integrating cross-modal knowledge, enabling their increasing adoption across real-world multimodal tasks. These knowledge databases may contain sensitive information that requires privacy protection. However, multimodal RAG systems inherently grant external users indirect access to such data, making them potentially vulnerable to privacy attacks, particularly membership inference attacks (MIAs). % Existing MIA methods targeting RAG systems predominantly focus on the textual modality, while the visual modality remains relatively underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose MrM, the first black-box MIA framework targeted at multimodal RAG systems. It utilizes a multi-object data perturbation framework constrained by counterfactual attacks, which can concurrently induce the RAG systems to retrieve the target data and generate information that leaks the membership information. Our method first employs an object-aware data perturbation method to constrain the perturbation to key semantics and ensure successful retrieval. Building on this, we design a counterfact-informed mask selection strategy to prioritize the most informative masked regions, aiming to eliminate the interference of model self-knowledge and amplify attack efficacy. Finally, we perform statistical membership inference by modeling query trials to extract features that reflect the reconstruction of masked semantics from response patterns. Experiments on two visual datasets and eight mainstream commercial visual-language models (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2) demonstrate that MrM achieves consistently strong performance across both sample-level and set-level evaluations, and remains robust under adaptive defenses.</p></details> |  |
