| **[Beyond Fixed: Variable-Length Denoising for Diffusion Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00819v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) are emerging as a powerful alternative to the dominant Autoregressive Large Language Models, offering efficient parallel generation and capable global context modeling. However, the practical application of DLLMs is hindered by a critical architectural constraint: the need for a statically predefined generation length. This static length allocation leads to a problematic trade-off: insufficient lengths cripple performance on complex tasks, while excessive lengths incur significant computational overhead and sometimes result in performance degradation. While the inference framework is rigid, we observe that the model itself possesses internal signals that correlate with the optimal response length for a given task. To bridge this gap, we leverage these latent signals and introduce DAEDAL, a novel training-free denoising strategy that enables Dynamic Adaptive Length Expansion for Diffusion Large Language Models. DAEDAL operates in two phases: 1) Before the denoising process, DAEDAL starts from a short initial length and iteratively expands it to a coarse task-appropriate length, guided by a sequence completion metric. 2) During the denoising process, DAEDAL dynamically intervenes by pinpointing and expanding insufficient generation regions through mask token insertion, ensuring the final output is fully developed. Extensive experiments on DLLMs demonstrate that DAEDAL achieves performance comparable, and in some cases superior, to meticulously tuned fixed-length baselines, while simultaneously enhancing computational efficiency by achieving a higher effective token ratio. By resolving the static length constraint, DAEDAL unlocks new potential for DLLMs, bridging a critical gap with their Autoregressive counterparts and paving the way for more efficient and capable generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/Li-Jinsong/DAEDAL</p></details> |
| **[Adacc: Adaptive Compression and Activation Checkpointing for LLM Memory Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00806v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training large language models often employs recomputation to alleviate memory pressure, which can introduce up to 30% overhead in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose Adacc, a novel memory management framework that combines adaptive compression and activation checkpointing to reduce the GPU memory footprint. It comprises three modules: (1) We design layer-specific compression algorithms that account for outliers in LLM tensors, instead of directly quantizing floats from FP16 to INT4, to ensure model accuracy. (2) We propose an optimal scheduling policy that employs MILP to determine the best memory optimization for each tensor. (3) To accommodate changes in training tensors, we introduce an adaptive policy evolution mechanism that adjusts the policy during training to enhance throughput. Experimental results show that Adacc can accelerate the LLM training by 1.01x to 1.37x compared to state-of-the-art frameworks, while maintaining comparable model accuracy to the Baseline.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[A Survey of Self-Evolving Agents: On Path to Artificial Super Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21046v3)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities but remain fundamentally static, unable to adapt their internal parameters to novel tasks, evolving knowledge domains, or dynamic interaction contexts. As LLMs are increasingly deployed in open-ended, interactive environments, this static nature has become a critical bottleneck, necessitating agents that can adaptively reason, act, and evolve in real time. This paradigm shift -- from scaling static models to developing self-evolving agents -- has sparked growing interest in architectures and methods enabling continual learning and adaptation from data, interactions, and experiences. This survey provides the first systematic and comprehensive review of self-evolving agents, organized around three foundational dimensions -- what to evolve, when to evolve, and how to evolve. We examine evolutionary mechanisms across agent components (e.g., models, memory, tools, architecture), categorize adaptation methods by stages (e.g., intra-test-time, inter-test-time), and analyze the algorithmic and architectural designs that guide evolutionary adaptation (e.g., scalar rewards, textual feedback, single-agent and multi-agent systems). Additionally, we analyze evaluation metrics and benchmarks tailored for self-evolving agents, highlight applications in domains such as coding, education, and healthcare, and identify critical challenges and research directions in safety, scalability, and co-evolutionary dynamics. By providing a structured framework for understanding and designing self-evolving agents, this survey establishes a roadmap for advancing adaptive agentic systems in both research and real-world deployments, ultimately shedding lights to pave the way for the realization of Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI), where agents evolve autonomously, performing at or beyond human-level intelligence across a wide array of tasks.</p></details> | 51 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Do They Understand Them? An Updated Evaluation on Nonbinary Pronoun Handling in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00788v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive contexts where fairness and inclusivity are critical. Pronoun usage, especially concerning gender-neutral and neopronouns, remains a key challenge for responsible AI. Prior work, such as the MISGENDERED benchmark, revealed significant limitations in earlier LLMs' handling of inclusive pronouns, but was constrained to outdated models and limited evaluations. In this study, we introduce MISGENDERED+, an extended and updated benchmark for evaluating LLMs' pronoun fidelity. We benchmark five representative LLMs, GPT-4o, Claude 4, DeepSeek-V3, Qwen Turbo, and Qwen2.5, across zero-shot, few-shot, and gender identity inference. Our results show notable improvements compared with previous studies, especially in binary and gender-neutral pronoun accuracy. However, accuracy on neopronouns and reverse inference tasks remains inconsistent, underscoring persistent gaps in identity-sensitive reasoning. We discuss implications, model-specific observations, and avenues for future inclusive AI research.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Investigation into Value Misalignment in LLM-Generated Texts for Cultural Heritage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02039v3)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent in tasks related to cultural heritage, such as generating descriptions of historical monuments, translating ancient texts, preserving oral traditions, and creating educational content, their ability to produce accurate and culturally aligned texts is being increasingly relied upon by users and researchers. However, cultural value misalignments may exist in generated texts, such as the misrepresentation of historical facts, the erosion of cultural identity, and the oversimplification of complex cultural narratives, which may lead to severe consequences. Therefore, investigating value misalignment in the context of LLM for cultural heritage is crucial for mitigating these risks, yet there has been a significant lack of systematic and comprehensive study and investigation in this area. To fill this gap, we systematically assess the reliability of LLMs in generating culturally aligned texts for cultural heritage-related tasks. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation by compiling an extensive set of 1066 query tasks covering 5 widely recognized categories with 17 aspects within the knowledge framework of cultural heritage across 5 open-source LLMs, and examine both the type and rate of cultural value misalignments in the generated texts. Using both automated and manual approaches, we effectively detect and analyze the cultural value misalignments in LLM-generated texts. Our findings are concerning: over 65% of the generated texts exhibit notable cultural misalignments, with certain tasks demonstrating almost complete misalignment with key cultural values. Beyond these findings, this paper introduces a benchmark dataset and a comprehensive evaluation workflow that can serve as a valuable resource for future research aimed at enhancing the cultural sensitivity and reliability of LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[ITUNLP at SemEval-2025 Task 8: Question-Answering over Tabular Data: A Zero-Shot Approach using LLM-Driven Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00762v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents our system for SemEval-2025 Task 8: DataBench, Question-Answering over Tabular Data. The primary objective of this task is to perform question answering on given tabular datasets from diverse domains under two subtasks: DataBench QA (Subtask I) and DataBench Lite QA (Subtask II). To tackle both subtasks, we developed a zero-shot solution with a particular emphasis on leveraging Large Language Model (LLM)-based code generation. Specifically, we propose a Python code generation framework utilizing state-of-the-art open-source LLMs to generate executable Pandas code via optimized prompting strategies. Our experiments reveal that different LLMs exhibit varying levels of effectiveness in Python code generation. Additionally, results show that Python code generation achieves superior performance in tabular question answering compared to alternative approaches. Although our ranking among zero-shot systems is unknown at the time of this paper's submission, our system achieved eighth place in Subtask I and sixth place in Subtask~II among the 30 systems that outperformed the baseline in the open-source models category.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Gender Bias via Fostering Exploratory Thinking in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17217v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit gender bias, resulting in unequal treatment of male and female subjects across different contexts. To address this issue, we propose a novel data generation framework that fosters exploratory thinking in LLMs. Our approach prompts models to generate story pairs featuring male and female protagonists in structurally identical, morally ambiguous scenarios, then elicits and compares their moral judgments. When inconsistencies arise, the model is guided to produce balanced, gender-neutral judgments. These story-judgment pairs are used to fine-tune or optimize the models via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results show that our method significantly reduces gender bias while preserving or even enhancing general model capabilities. We will release the code and generated data. We release the code and generated data at: https://github.com/WeiKangda/LLMs-Exploratory-Bias-Mitigation/tree/main.</p></details> |  |
| **[MMBERT: Scaled Mixture-of-Experts Multimodal BERT for Robust Chinese Hate Speech Detection under Cloaking Perturbations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00760v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hate speech detection on Chinese social networks presents distinct challenges, particularly due to the widespread use of cloaking techniques designed to evade conventional text-based detection systems. Although large language models (LLMs) have recently improved hate speech detection capabilities, the majority of existing work has concentrated on English datasets, with limited attention given to multimodal strategies in the Chinese context. In this study, we propose MMBERT, a novel BERT-based multimodal framework that integrates textual, speech, and visual modalities through a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. To address the instability associated with directly integrating MoE into BERT-based models, we develop a progressive three-stage training paradigm. MMBERT incorporates modality-specific experts, a shared self-attention mechanism, and a router-based expert allocation strategy to enhance robustness against adversarial perturbations. Empirical results in several Chinese hate speech datasets show that MMBERT significantly surpasses fine-tuned BERT-based encoder models, fine-tuned LLMs, and LLMs utilizing in-context learning approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[GLiDRE: Generalist Lightweight model for Document-level Relation Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00757v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relation Extraction (RE) is a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing, and its document-level variant poses significant challenges, due to the need to model complex interactions between entities across sentences. Current approaches, largely based on the ATLOP architecture, are commonly evaluated on benchmarks like DocRED and Re-DocRED. However, their performance in zero-shot or few-shot settings remains largely underexplored due to the task's complexity. Recently, the GLiNER model has shown that a compact NER model can outperform much larger Large Language Models. With a similar motivation, we introduce GLiDRE, a new model for document-level relation extraction that builds on the key ideas of GliNER. We benchmark GLiDRE against state-of-the-art models across various data settings on the Re-DocRED dataset. Our results demonstrate that GLiDRE achieves state-of-the-art performance in few-shot scenarios. Our code is publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ARR July</p></details> |
| **[Sound and Complete Neurosymbolic Reasoning with LLM-Grounded Interpretations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09751v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, but they exhibit problems with logical consistency in the output they generate. How can we harness LLMs' broad-coverage parametric knowledge in formal reasoning despite their inconsistency? We present a method for directly integrating an LLM into the interpretation function of the formal semantics for a paraconsistent logic. We provide experimental evidence for the feasibility of the method by evaluating the function using datasets created from several short-form factuality benchmarks. Unlike prior work, our method offers a theoretical framework for neurosymbolic reasoning that leverages an LLM's knowledge while preserving the underlying logic's soundness and completeness properties.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 9 tables, 3 figures.

| **[Agentic large language models improve retrieval-based radiology question answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00743v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical decision-making in radiology increasingly benefits from artificial intelligence (AI), particularly through large language models (LLMs). However, traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for radiology question answering (QA) typically rely on single-step retrieval, limiting their ability to handle complex clinical reasoning tasks. Here we propose an agentic RAG framework enabling LLMs to autonomously decompose radiology questions, iteratively retrieve targeted clinical evidence from Radiopaedia, and dynamically synthesize evidence-based responses. We evaluated 24 LLMs spanning diverse architectures, parameter scales (0.5B to >670B), and training paradigms (general-purpose, reasoning-optimized, clinically fine-tuned), using 104 expert-curated radiology questions from previously established RSNA-RadioQA and ExtendedQA datasets. Agentic retrieval significantly improved mean diagnostic accuracy over zero-shot prompting (73% vs. 64%; P<0.001) and conventional online RAG (73% vs. 68%; P<0.001). The greatest gains occurred in mid-sized models (e.g., Mistral Large improved from 72% to 81%) and small-scale models (e.g., Qwen 2.5-7B improved from 55% to 71%), while very large models (>200B parameters) demonstrated minimal changes (<2% improvement). Additionally, agentic retrieval reduced hallucinations (mean 9.4%) and retrieved clinically relevant context in 46% of cases, substantially aiding factual grounding. Even clinically fine-tuned models exhibited meaningful improvements (e.g., MedGemma-27B improved from 71% to 81%), indicating complementary roles of retrieval and fine-tuning. These results highlight the potential of agentic frameworks to enhance factuality and diagnostic accuracy in radiology QA, particularly among mid-sized LLMs, warranting future studies to validate their clinical utility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Applying Psychometrics to Large Language Model Simulated Populations: Recreating the HEXACO Personality Inventory Experiment with Generative Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00742v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative agents powered by Large Language Models demonstrate human-like characteristics through sophisticated natural language interactions. Their ability to assume roles and personalities based on predefined character biographies has positioned them as cost-effective substitutes for human participants in social science research. This paper explores the validity of such persona-based agents in representing human populations; we recreate the HEXACO personality inventory experiment by surveying 310 GPT-4 powered agents, conducting factor analysis on their responses, and comparing these results to the original findings presented by Ashton, Lee, & Goldberg in 2004. Our results found 1) a coherent and reliable personality structure was recoverable from the agents' responses demonstrating partial alignment to the HEXACO framework. 2) the derived personality dimensions were consistent and reliable within GPT-4, when coupled with a sufficiently curated population, and 3) cross-model analysis revealed variability in personality profiling, suggesting model-specific biases and limitations. We discuss the practical considerations and challenges encountered during the experiment. This study contributes to the ongoing discourse on the potential benefits and limitations of using generative agents in social science research and provides useful guidance on designing consistent and representative agent personas to maximise coverage and representation of human personality traits.</p></details> | 26 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Out-of-Context Abduction: LLMs Make Inferences About Procedural Data Leveraging Declarative Facts in Earlier Training Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00741v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are trained on large corpora, yet it is unclear whether they can reason about the information present within their training data. We design experiments to study out-of-context abduction in LLMs, the ability to infer the most plausible explanations for observations using relevant facts present in training data. We train treatment LLMs on names and behavior descriptions of fictitious chatbots, but not on examples of dialogue with the chatbots. We find that OpenAI's GPT 4o LLM can correctly infer at least one chatbot's name after observing example responses characteristic of that chatbot. We also find that previously training GPT 4o on descriptions of a chatbot's behavior allows it to display behaviors more characteristic of the chatbot when iteratively trained to display such behaviors. Our results have implications for situational awareness in LLMs and, therefore, for AI safety.</p></details> |  |
| **[How LLMs are Shaping the Future of Virtual Reality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00737v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into Virtual Reality (VR) games marks a paradigm shift in the design of immersive, adaptive, and intelligent digital experiences. This paper presents a comprehensive review of recent research at the intersection of LLMs and VR, examining how these models are transforming narrative generation, non-player character (NPC) interactions, accessibility, personalization, and game mastering. Drawing from an analysis of 62 peer reviewed studies published between 2018 and 2025, we identify key application domains ranging from emotionally intelligent NPCs and procedurally generated storytelling to AI-driven adaptive systems and inclusive gameplay interfaces. We also address the major challenges facing this convergence, including real-time performance constraints, memory limitations, ethical risks, and scalability barriers. Our findings highlight that while LLMs significantly enhance realism, creativity, and user engagement in VR environments, their effective deployment requires robust design strategies that integrate multimodal interaction, hybrid AI architectures, and ethical safeguards. The paper concludes by outlining future research directions in multimodal AI, affective computing, reinforcement learning, and open-source development, aiming to guide the responsible advancement of intelligent and inclusive VR systems.</p></details> | Pre-print |
| **[MIHBench: Benchmarking and Mitigating Multi-Image Hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00726v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite growing interest in hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models, existing studies primarily focus on single-image settings, leaving hallucination in multi-image scenarios largely unexplored. To address this gap, we conduct the first systematic study of hallucinations in multi-image MLLMs and propose MIHBench, a benchmark specifically tailored for evaluating object-related hallucinations across multiple images. MIHBench comprises three core tasks: Multi-Image Object Existence Hallucination, Multi-Image Object Count Hallucination, and Object Identity Consistency Hallucination, targeting semantic understanding across object existence, quantity reasoning, and cross-view identity consistency. Through extensive evaluation, we identify key factors associated with the occurrence of multi-image hallucinations, including: a progressive relationship between the number of image inputs and the likelihood of hallucination occurrences; a strong correlation between single-image hallucination tendencies and those observed in multi-image contexts; and the influence of same-object image ratios and the positional placement of negative samples within image sequences on the occurrence of object identity consistency hallucination. To address these challenges, we propose a Dynamic Attention Balancing mechanism that adjusts inter-image attention distributions while preserving the overall visual attention proportion. Experiments across multiple state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces hallucination occurrences and enhances semantic integration and reasoning stability in multi-image scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM M...</summary><p>ACM MM25 has accepted this paper</p></details> |
| **[Dynamically Adaptive Reasoning via LLM-Guided MCTS for Efficient and Context-Aware KGQA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00719v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) aims to interpret natural language queries and perform structured reasoning over knowledge graphs by leveraging their relational and semantic structures to retrieve accurate answers. Recent KGQA methods primarily follow either retrieve-then-reason paradigm, relying on GNNs or heuristic rules for static paths extraction, or dynamic path generation strategies that use large language models (LLMs) with prompting to jointly perform retrieval and reasoning. However, the former suffers from limited adaptability due to static path extraction and lack of contextual refinement, while the latter incurs high computational costs and struggles with accurate path evaluation due to reliance on fixed scoring functions and extensive LLM calls. To address these issues, this paper proposes Dynamically Adaptive MCTS-based Reasoning (DAMR), a novel framework that integrates symbolic search with adaptive path evaluation for efficient and context-aware KGQA. DAMR employs a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) backbone guided by an LLM-based planner, which selects top-$k$ relevant relations at each step to reduce search space. To improve path evaluation accuracy, we introduce a lightweight Transformer-based scorer that performs context-aware plausibility estimation by jointly encoding the question and relation sequence through cross-attention, enabling the model to capture fine-grained semantic shifts during multi-hop reasoning. Furthermore, to alleviate the scarcity of high-quality supervision, DAMR incorporates a dynamic pseudo-path refinement mechanism that periodically generates training signals from partial paths explored during search, allowing the scorer to continuously adapt to the evolving distribution of reasoning trajectories. Extensive experiments on multiple KGQA benchmarks show that DAMR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring the Evidence-Based SE Beliefs of Generative AI Tools](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13900v3)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent innovations in generative artificial intelligence (AI), primarily powered by large language models (LLMs), have transformed how programmers develop and maintain software -- leading to new frontiers in software engineering (SE). The advanced capabilities of generative AI tools to support software development tasks have led to a rise in their adoption within software development workflows. However, little is known about how AI tools perceive evidence-based beliefs and practices verified by research findings. To this end, we conduct a preliminary evaluation conceptually replicating prior work to explore the "beliefs" of generative AI tools used to support software development tasks. We investigate 17 evidence-based claims posited by empirical SE research across five generative AI tools. Our findings show that generative AI tools have ambiguous beliefs regarding research claims and lack credible evidence to support responses. Based on our results, we provide implications for practitioners integrating generative AI-based systems into development contexts and shed light on future research directions to enhance the reliability and trustworthiness of generative AI -- aiming to increase awareness and adoption of evidence-based SE research findings in practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Is LLM-Generated Code More Maintainable \& Reliable than Human-Written Code?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00700v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software development has opened new possibilities for code generation. Despite the widespread use of this technology, it remains unclear how well LLMs generate code solutions in terms of software quality and how they compare to human-written code. Aims: This study compares the internal quality attributes of LLM-generated and human-written code. Method: Our empirical study integrates datasets of coding tasks, three LLM configurations (zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning), and SonarQube to assess software quality. The dataset comprises Python code solutions across three difficulty levels: introductory, interview, and competition. We analyzed key code quality metrics, including maintainability and reliability, and the estimated effort required to resolve code issues. Results: Our analysis shows that LLM-generated code has fewer bugs and requires less effort to fix them overall. Interestingly, fine-tuned models reduced the prevalence of high-severity issues, such as blocker and critical bugs, and shifted them to lower-severity categories, but decreased the model's performance. In competition-level problems, the LLM solutions sometimes introduce structural issues that are not present in human-written code. Conclusion: Our findings provide valuable insights into the quality of LLM-generated code; however, the introduction of critical issues in more complex scenarios highlights the need for a systematic evaluation and validation of LLM solutions. Our work deepens the understanding of the strengths and limitations of LLMs for code generation.</p></details> | Accepted ESEM2025 |

Benchmarking four LLMs on the official PAN~2024 and 2025 "Multi-Author Writing Style Analysis" datasets, we present several observations. First, state-of-the-art generative models are sensitive to variations in writing style - even at the granular level of individual sentences. Second, their accuracy establishes a challenging baseline for the task, outperforming suggested baselines of the PAN competition. Finally, we explore the influence of semantics on model predictions and present evidence suggesting that the latest generation of LLMs may be more sensitive to content-independent and purely stylistic signals than previously reported.</p></details> |  |

While comprehensive benchmarks exist for assessing LLM performance in English, there remains a significant gap in evaluation resources for other languages. Moreover, because most LLMs are trained primarily on data rooted in European and American cultures, they often lack familiarity with non-Western cultural contexts. To address this limitation, our study focuses on the Persian language and Iranian culture. We introduce 19 new evaluation datasets specifically designed to assess LLMs on topics such as Iranian law, Persian grammar, Persian idioms, and university entrance exams. Using these datasets, we benchmarked 41 prominent LLMs, aiming to bridge the existing cultural and linguistic evaluation gap in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

However, most existing models are task-specific and lack generalization across patient populations. Inspired by the autoregressive paradigm of large language models, we introduce CGM-LSM, a Transformer decoder-based Large Sensor Model (LSM) pretrained on 1.6 million CGM records from patients with different diabetes types, ages, and genders. We model patients as sequences of glucose time steps to learn latent knowledge embedded in CGM data and apply it to the prediction of glucose readings for a 2-hour horizon. Compared with prior methods, CGM-LSM significantly improves prediction accuracy and robustness: a 48.51% reduction in root mean square error in one-hour horizon forecasting and consistent zero-shot prediction performance across held-out patient groups. We analyze model performance variations across patient subgroups and prediction scenarios and outline key opportunities and challenges for advancing CGM foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Medical Reasoning in the Era of LLMs: A Systematic Review of Enhancement Techniques and Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00669v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in medicine has enabled impressive capabilities, yet a critical gap remains in their ability to perform systematic, transparent, and verifiable reasoning, a cornerstone of clinical practice. This has catalyzed a shift from single-step answer generation to the development of LLMs explicitly designed for medical reasoning. This paper provides the first systematic review of this emerging field. We propose a taxonomy of reasoning enhancement techniques, categorized into training-time strategies (e.g., supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning) and test-time mechanisms (e.g., prompt engineering, multi-agent systems). We analyze how these techniques are applied across different data modalities (text, image, code) and in key clinical applications such as diagnosis, education, and treatment planning. Furthermore, we survey the evolution of evaluation benchmarks from simple accuracy metrics to sophisticated assessments of reasoning quality and visual interpretability. Based on an analysis of 60 seminal studies from 2022-2025, we conclude by identifying critical challenges, including the faithfulness-plausibility gap and the need for native multimodal reasoning, and outlining future directions toward building efficient, robust, and sociotechnically responsible medical AI.</p></details> |  |

This creates concerns about issue bias, where an LLM tends to present just one perspective on a given issue, which in turn may influence how users think about this issue. So far, it has not been possible to measure which issue biases LLMs actually manifest in real user interactions, making it difficult to address the risks from biased LLMs. Therefore, we create IssueBench: a set of 2.49m realistic prompts for measuring issue bias in LLM writing assistance, which we construct based on 3.9k templates (e.g. "write a blog about") and 212 political issues (e.g. "AI regulation") from real user interactions. Using IssueBench, we show that issue biases are common and persistent in state-of-the-art LLMs. We also show that biases are remarkably similar across models, and that all models align more with US Democrat than Republican voter opinion on a subset of issues. IssueBench can easily be adapted to include other issues, templates, or tasks. By enabling robust and realistic measurement, we hope that IssueBench can bring a new quality of evidence to ongoing discussions about LLM biases and how to address them.</p></details> | under review |

This paper proposes TOSense-a Chrome extension that allows users to ask questions about ToS in natural language and get concise answers in real time. The system combines (i) a crawler "tos-crawl" that automatically extracts ToS content, and (ii) a lightweight large language model pipeline: MiniLM for semantic retrieval and BART-encoder for answer relevance verification. To avoid expensive manual annotation, we present a novel Question Answering Evaluation Pipeline (QEP) that generates synthetic questions and verifies the correctness of answers using clustered topic matching. Experiments on five major platforms, Apple, Google, X (formerly Twitter), Microsoft, and Netflix, show the effectiveness of TOSense (with up to 44.5% accuracy) across varying number of topic clusters.

However, most existing multimodal math benchmarks are limited to single-visual contexts, which diverges from the multi-visual scenarios commonly encountered in real-world mathematical applications. To address this gap, we introduce MV-MATH: a meticulously curated dataset of 2,009 high-quality mathematical problems. Each problem integrates multiple images interleaved with text, derived from authentic K-12 scenarios, and enriched with detailed annotations. MV-MATH includes multiple-choice, free-form, and multi-step questions, covering 11 subject areas across 3 difficulty levels, and serves as a comprehensive and rigorous benchmark for assessing MLLMs' mathematical reasoning in multi-visual contexts. Through extensive experimentation, we observe that MLLMs encounter substantial challenges in multi-visual math tasks, with a considerable performance gap relative to human capabilities on MV-MATH. Furthermore, we analyze the performance and error patterns of various models, providing insights into MLLMs' mathematical reasoning capabilities within multi-visual settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, accepted by CVPR2025</p></details> |
| **[MCeT: Behavioral Model Correctness Evaluation using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00630v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Behavioral model diagrams, e.g., sequence diagrams, are an essential form of documentation that are typically designed by system engineers from requirements documentation, either fully manually or assisted by design tools. With the growing use of Large Language Models (LLM) as AI modeling assistants, more automation will be involved in generating diagrams. This necessitates the advancement of automatic model correctness evaluation tools. Such a tool can be used to evaluate both manually and AI automatically generated models; to provide feedback to system engineers, and enable AI assistants to self-evaluate and self-enhance their generated models. In this paper, we propose MCeT, the first fully automated tool to evaluate the correctness of a behavioral model, sequence diagrams in particular, against its corresponding requirements text and produce a list of issues that the model has. We utilize LLMs for the correctness evaluation tasks as they have shown outstanding natural language understanding ability. However, we show that directly asking an LLM to compare a diagram to requirements finds less than 35% of issues that experienced engineers can find. We propose to supplement the direct check with a fine-grained, multi-perspective approach; we split the diagram into atomic, non-divisible interactions, and split the requirements text into atomic, self-contained items. We compare the diagram with atomic requirements and each diagram-atom with the requirements. We also propose a self-consistency checking approach that combines perspectives to mitigate LLM hallucinated issues. Our combined approach improves upon the precision of the direct approach from 0.58 to 0.81 in a dataset of real requirements. Moreover, the approach finds 90% more issues that the experienced engineers found than the direct approach, and reports an average of 6 new issues per diagram.</p></details> | MODELS 2025 |
| **[DACTYL: Diverse Adversarial Corpus of Texts Yielded from Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00619v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing AIG (AI-generated) text detectors struggle in real-world settings despite succeeding in internal testing, suggesting that they may not be robust enough. We rigorously examine the machine-learning procedure to build these detectors to address this. Most current AIG text detection datasets focus on zero-shot generations, but little work has been done on few-shot or one-shot generations, where LLMs are given human texts as an example. In response, we introduce the Diverse Adversarial Corpus of Texts Yielded from Language models (DACTYL), a challenging AIG text detection dataset focusing on one-shot/few-shot generations. We also include texts from domain-specific continued-pre-trained (CPT) language models, where we fully train all parameters using a memory-efficient optimization approach. Many existing AIG text detectors struggle significantly on our dataset, indicating a potential vulnerability to one-shot/few-shot and CPT-generated texts. We also train our own classifiers using two approaches: standard binary cross-entropy (BCE) optimization and a more recent approach, deep X-risk optimization (DXO). While BCE-trained classifiers marginally outperform DXO classifiers on the DACTYL test set, the latter excels on out-of-distribution (OOD) texts. In our mock deployment scenario in student essay detection with an OOD student essay dataset, the best DXO classifier outscored the best BCE-trained classifier by 50.56 macro-F1 score points at the lowest false positive rates for both. Our results indicate that DXO classifiers generalize better without overfitting to the test set. Our experiments highlight several areas of improvement for AIG text detectors.</p></details> | <details><summary>MPhil...</summary><p>MPhil in Advanced Computer Science thesis for University of Cambridge</p></details> |
| **[SEFL: Enhancing Educational Assignment Feedback with LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12927v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Providing high-quality feedback to student assignments is crucial for student success, but it is constrained by time and costs. In this work, we introduce Synthetic Educational Feedback Loops (SEFL), a synthetic data framework designed to generate data that resembles immediate, on-demand feedback at scale without relying on extensive, real-world student assignments. To get this type of data, two large language models (LLMs) operate in teacher-student roles to simulate assignment completion and formative feedback, generating synthetic pairs of student work and corresponding critiques and actionable improvements from a teacher. With this data, we fine-tune smaller, more computationally efficient LLMs on these synthetic pairs, enabling them to replicate key features of high-quality, goal-oriented feedback. Unlike personalized tutoring approaches that offer multi-turn, individualized instruction, SEFL specifically focuses on replicating the teacher-student assignment feedback loop in higher education. Through comprehensive evaluations with four LLM judges and three human experts, we demonstrate that SEFL-tuned models outperform both their non-tuned counterparts in feedback quality and an existing baseline. The potential for societal impact is reinforced by extensive qualitative comments by ratings by human stakeholders -- both students and higher education instructors. All in all, SEFL has substantial potential to transform feedback processes for higher education and beyond.</p></details> |  |
| **[LeakSealer: A Semisupervised Defense for LLMs Against Prompt Injection and Leakage Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00602v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generalization capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to their widespread deployment across various applications. However, this increased adoption has introduced several security threats, notably in the forms of jailbreaking and data leakage attacks. Additionally, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), while enhancing context-awareness in LLM responses, has inadvertently introduced vulnerabilities that can result in the leakage of sensitive information. Our contributions are twofold. First, we introduce a methodology to analyze historical interaction data from an LLM system, enabling the generation of usage maps categorized by topics (including adversarial interactions). This approach further provides forensic insights for tracking the evolution of jailbreaking attack patterns. Second, we propose LeakSealer, a model-agnostic framework that combines static analysis for forensic insights with dynamic defenses in a Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) pipeline. This technique identifies topic groups and detects anomalous patterns, allowing for proactive defense mechanisms. We empirically evaluate LeakSealer under two scenarios: (1) jailbreak attempts, employing a public benchmark dataset, and (2) PII leakage, supported by a curated dataset of labeled LLM interactions. In the static setting, LeakSealer achieves the highest precision and recall on the ToxicChat dataset when identifying prompt injection. In the dynamic setting, PII leakage detection achieves an AUPRC of $0.97$, significantly outperforming baselines such as Llama Guard.</p></details> | 22 pages, preprint |

To address these limitations, we propose a novel task, Time-series Reasoning for Anomaly (Time-RA) that transforms classical time series anomaly detection from a discriminative into a generative, reasoning-intensive task leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). Also, we introduce the first real-world multimodal benchmark dataset, RATs40K, explicitly annotated for anomaly reasoning, comprising approximately 40,000 samples across 10 real-world domains. Each sample includes numeric time series data, contextual text information, and visual representations, each annotated with fine-grained categories (14 types for univariate anomalies and 6 for multivariate anomalies) and structured explanatory reasoning. We develop a sophisticated annotation framework utilizing ensemble-generated labels refined through GPT-4-driven feedback, ensuring accuracy and interpretability. Extensive benchmarking of LLMs and multimodal LLMs demonstrates the capabilities and limitations of current models, highlighting the critical role of supervised fine-tuning. Our dataset and task pave the way for significant advancements in interpretable time series anomaly detection and reasoning. The code (https://github.com/yyysjz1997/Time-RA) and dataset (https://huggingface.co/datasets/Time-RA/RATs40K) have been fully open-sourced to support and accelerate future research in this area.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review. 19 pages, 8 figures, 12 tables.

| **[A Context-Aware Dual-Metric Framework for Confidence Estimation in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00600v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate confidence estimation is essential for trustworthy large language models (LLMs) systems, as it empowers the user to determine when to trust outputs and enables reliable deployment in safety-critical applications. Current confidence estimation methods for LLMs neglect the relevance between responses and contextual information, a crucial factor in output quality evaluation, particularly in scenarios where background knowledge is provided. To bridge this gap, we propose CRUX (Context-aware entropy Reduction and Unified consistency eXamination), the first framework that integrates context faithfulness and consistency for confidence estimation via two novel metrics. First, contextual entropy reduction represents data uncertainty with the information gain through contrastive sampling with and without context. Second, unified consistency examination captures potential model uncertainty through the global consistency of the generated answers with and without context. Experiments across three benchmark datasets (CoQA, SQuAD, QuAC) and two domain-specific datasets (BioASQ, EduQG) demonstrate CRUX's effectiveness, achieving the highest AUROC than existing baselines.</p></details> |  |

Several influential works have already appeared in the field of AI Scientist systems, with AI-generated research papers having been accepted at the ICLR 2025 workshop, suggesting that a human-level AI Scientist capable of uncovering phenomena previously unknown to humans, may soon become a reality. In this survey, we focus on the central question: How far are AI scientists from changing the world and reshaping the scientific research paradigm? To answer this question, we provide a prospect-driven review that comprehensively analyzes the current achievements of AI Scientist systems, identifying key bottlenecks and the critical components required for the emergence of a scientific agent capable of producing ground-breaking discoveries that solve grand challenges. We hope this survey will contribute to a clearer understanding of limitations of current AI Scientist systems, showing where we are, what is missing, and what the ultimate goals for scientific AI should be.</p></details> |  |
| **[From EMR Data to Clinical Insight: An LLM-Driven Framework for Automated Pre-Consultation Questionnaire Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00581v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-consultation is a critical component of effective healthcare delivery. However, generating comprehensive pre-consultation questionnaires from complex, voluminous Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) is a challenging task. Direct Large Language Model (LLM) approaches face difficulties in this task, particularly regarding information completeness, logical order, and disease-level synthesis. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-stage LLM-driven framework: Stage 1 extracts atomic assertions (key facts with timing) from EMRs; Stage 2 constructs personal causal networks and synthesizes disease knowledge by clustering representative networks from an EMR corpus; Stage 3 generates tailored personal and standardized disease-specific questionnaires based on these structured representations. This framework overcomes limitations of direct methods by building explicit clinical knowledge. Evaluated on a real-world EMR dataset and validated by clinical experts, our method demonstrates superior performance in information coverage, diagnostic relevance, understandability, and generation time, highlighting its practical potential to enhance patient information collection.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |

The existing methods can be categorized into Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM)-based and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based methods. However, the former were susceptible to hallucinations, while the latter struggled for inter-modal disconnection and cross-page fragmentation. To address these challenges, a novel multi-modal RAG model, named MMRAG-DocQA, was proposed, leveraging both textual and visual information across long-range pages to facilitate accurate question answering. A hierarchical indexing method with the integration of flattened in-page chunks and topological cross-page chunks was designed to jointly establish in-page multi-modal associations and long-distance cross-page dependencies. By means of joint similarity evaluation and large language model (LLM)-based re-ranking, a multi-granularity semantic retrieval method, including the page-level parent page retrieval and document-level summary retrieval, was proposed to foster multi-modal evidence connection and long-distance evidence integration and reasoning. Experimental results performed on public datasets, MMLongBench-Doc and LongDocURL, demonstrated the superiority of our MMRAG-DocQA method in understanding and answering modality-rich and multi-page documents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Embracing Large Language Models in Traffic Flow Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12201v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic flow forecasting aims to predict future traffic flows based on the historical traffic conditions and the road network. It is an important problem in intelligent transportation systems, with a plethora of methods been proposed. Existing efforts mainly focus on capturing and utilizing spatio-temporal dependencies to predict future traffic flows. Though promising, they fall short in adapting to test-time environmental changes of traffic conditions. To tackle this challenge, we propose to introduce large language models (LLMs) to help traffic flow forecasting and design a novel method named Large Language Model Enhanced Traffic Flow Predictor (LEAF). LEAF adopts two branches, capturing different spatio-temporal relations using graph and hypergraph structures respectively. The two branches are first pre-trained individually, and during test-time, they yield different predictions. Based on these predictions, a large language model is used to select the most likely result. Then, a ranking loss is applied as the learning objective to enhance the prediction ability of the two branches. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed LEAF.</p></details> | Accepted by ACL 2025 |
| **[SynAdapt: Learning Adaptive Reasoning in Large Language Models via Synthetic Continuous Chain-of-Thought](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00574v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves model performance, it incurs significant time costs due to the generation of discrete CoT tokens (DCoT). Continuous CoT (CCoT) offers a more efficient alternative, but existing CCoT methods are hampered by indirect fine-tuning, limited alignment, or inconsistent targets. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textit{SynAdapt}, an innovative efficient reasoning framework. Specifically, \textit{SynAdapt} generates the synthetic CCoT to serve as a precise and effective alignment target for LLMs. This synthetic CCoT explicitly guides the LLM to learn CCoT and derive accurate answers directly. Furthermore, relying solely on CCoT is insufficient for solving hard questions. To address this, \textit{SynAdapt} integrates a difficulty classifier that leverages both question context and CCoT to identify hard questions. CCoT can effectively help identify hard questions after some brief reasoning. We then adaptively prompt the LLM to re-think these hard questions for improved performance. Extensive experimental results across various benchmarks from different difficulty levels strongly demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off.</p></details> |  |
| **[Session-Based Recommendation with Validated and Enriched LLM Intents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00570v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Session-based recommendation (SBR) aims to predict the next item for an anonymous user in a timely manner. However, SBR suffers from data sparsity due to the short and anonymous nature of sessions. Recently, an emerging line of work has explored inferring the underlying user intents of a session using large language models (LLMs), with the generated intents serving as auxiliary training signals to enhance SBR models. Despite its promise, this approach faces three key challenges: validating intent quality, incorporating session-level multi-intents, and complementing inevitable LLM failure cases. In this paper, we propose VELI4SBR, a two-stage framework that leverages Validated and Enriched LLM-generated Intents for SBR. In the first stage, we generate high-quality intents using a predict-and-correct loop that validates the informativeness of LLM-generated intents with a global intent pool to constrain the LLM's output space and reduce hallucination. In the second stage, we enhance the SBR model using the generated intents through a lightweight multi-intent prediction and fusion mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce a training strategy that compensates for LLM failures by inferring intents from inter-session behavioral similarities. Extensive experiments show that VELI4SBR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while improving explainability.</p></details> |  |

However, the high sensitivity to market noise undermines the performance of LLM-based trading systems. To address this limitation, we propose a novel multi-agent system featuring an internal competitive mechanism inspired by modern corporate management structures. The system consists of two specialized teams: (1) Data Team - responsible for processing and condensing massive market data into diversified text factors, ensuring they fit the model's constrained context. (2) Research Team - tasked with making parallelized multipath trading decisions based on deep research methods. The core innovation lies in implementing a real-time evaluation and ranking mechanism within each team, driven by authentic market feedback. Each agent's performance undergoes continuous scoring and ranking, with only outputs from top-performing agents being adopted. The design enables the system to adaptively adjust to dynamic environment, enhances robustness against market noise and ultimately delivers superior trading performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed system significantly outperforms prevailing multiagent systems and traditional quantitative investment methods across diverse evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |

Even smaller variants, such as small-language models (SLMs), take several days to train in the best-case scenarios, often requiring multiple GPUs. This paper explores methods to train and evaluate decoder-only transformer-based language models in hours instead of days/weeks. We introduces \textit{PaPaformer}, a decoder-only transformer architecture variant, whose lower-dimensional parallel paths are combined into larger model. The paper shows that these lower-dimensional paths can be trained individually with different types of training data and then combined into one larger model. This method gives the option to reduce the total number of model parameters and the training time with increasing performance. Moreover, the use of parallel path structure opens interesting possibilities to customize paths to accommodate specific task requirements.</p></details> |  |

Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improves model generalization for both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers by encouraging convergence to locally flat minima. However, the connection between sharpness and generalization has not been fully explored for LoRA due to the lack of tools to either empirically seek flat minima or develop theoretical methods. In this work, we propose Flat-LoRA and its efficient version i.e., EFlat-LoRA, to seek flat minima for LoRA. Concretely, we theoretically demonstrate that perturbations in the full parameter space can be transferred to the low-rank subspace. This approach eliminates the potential interference introduced by perturbations across multiple matrices in the low-rank subspace. Our extensive experiments on large language models and vision-language models demonstrate that EFlat-LoRA achieves optimize efficiency comparable to that of LoRA while simultaneously attaining comparable or even better performance. For example, on the GLUE dataset with RoBERTa-large, EFlat-LoRA outperforms LoRA and full fine-tuning by 1.0% and 0.5% on average, respectively. On vision-language models e.g., Qwen-VL-Chat shows performance improvements of 1.5% and 1.0% on SQA and VizWiz datasets, respectively. These empirical results also verify that the generalization of LoRA is closely related to sharpness, which is omitted by previous methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdaptiVocab: Enhancing LLM Efficiency in Focused Domains through Lightweight Vocabulary Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19693v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive versatility as general purpose models. However, their broad applicability comes at a high-cost computational overhead, particularly in auto-regressive decoding where each step requires a forward pass. In domain-specific settings, general-purpose capabilities are unnecessary and can be exchanged for efficiency. In this work, we take a novel perspective on domain adaptation, reducing latency and computational costs by adapting the vocabulary to focused domains of interest. We introduce AdaptiVocab, an end-to-end approach for vocabulary adaptation, designed to enhance LLM efficiency in low-resource domains. AdaptiVocab can be applied to any tokenizer and architecture, modifying the vocabulary by replacing tokens with domain-specific n-gram-based tokens, thereby reducing the number of tokens required for both input processing and output generation. AdaptiVocab initializes new n-token embeddings using an exponentially weighted combination of existing embeddings and employs a lightweight fine-tuning phase that can be efficiently performed on a single GPU. We evaluate two 7B LLMs across three niche domains, assessing efficiency, generation quality, and end-task performance. Our results show that AdaptiVocab reduces token usage by over 25% without compromising performance</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a systematic survey of the growing complexity of jailbreak attacks and corresponding defense mechanisms within the expanding LLM ecosystem. We first trace the developmental trajectory from LLMs to MLLMs and Agents, highlighting the core security challenges emerging at each stage. Next, we categorize mainstream jailbreak techniques from both the attack impact and visibility perspectives, and provide a comprehensive analysis of representative attack methods, related datasets, and evaluation metrics. On the defense side, we organize existing strategies based on response timing and technical approach, offering a structured understanding of their applicability and implementation. Furthermore, we identify key limitations in existing surveys, such as insufficient attention to agent-specific security issues, the absence of a clear taxonomy for hybrid jailbreak methods, a lack of detailed analysis of experimental setups, and outdated coverage of recent advancements. To address these limitations, we provide an updated synthesis of recent work and outline future research directions in areas such as dataset construction, evaluation framework optimization, and strategy generalization. Our study seeks to enhance the understanding of jailbreak mechanisms and facilitate the advancement of more resilient and adaptive defense strategies in the context of ever more capable LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, existing GAD methods primarily focus on designing complex optimization objectives within the graph domain, overlooking the complementary value of the textual modality, whose features are often encoded by shallow embedding techniques, such as bag-of-words or skip-gram, so that semantic context related to anomalies may be missed. To unleash the enormous potential of textual modality, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising alternatives due to their strong semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities. Nevertheless, their application to TAG anomaly detection remains nascent, and they struggle to encode high-order structural information inherent in graphs due to input length constraints. For high-quality anomaly detection in TAGs, we propose CoLL, a novel framework that combines LLMs and graph neural networks (GNNs) to leverage their complementary strengths. CoLL employs multi-LLM collaboration for evidence-augmented generation to capture anomaly-relevant contexts while delivering human-readable rationales for detected anomalies. Moreover, CoLL integrates a GNN equipped with a gating mechanism to adaptively fuse textual features with evidence while preserving high-order topological information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of CoLL, achieving an average improvement of 13.37% in AP. This study opens a new avenue for incorporating LLMs in advancing GAD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Multimedia 2025 (MM '25)</p></details> |

While recent LLM-based scientist agents show promise in autonomous scientific discovery, they often lack the interactive reasoning and evaluation mechanisms essential to real-world research. We propose IDVSCI (Internal Discussion and Vote SCIentists), a multi-agent framework built on LLMs that incorporates two key innovations: a Dynamic Knowledge Exchange mechanism enabling iterative feedback among agents, and a Dual-Diversity Review paradigm that simulates heterogeneous expert evaluation. These components jointly promote deeper reasoning and the generation of more creative and impactful scientific ideas. To evaluate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach, we conduct experiments on two datasets: a widely used benchmark in computer science and a new dataset we introduce in the health sciences domain. Results show that IDVSCI consistently achieves the best performance across both datasets, outperforming existing systems such as AI Scientist and VIRSCI. These findings highlight the value of modeling interaction and peer review dynamics in LLM-based autonomous research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pro2Guard: Proactive Runtime Enforcement of LLM Agent Safety via Probabilistic Model Checking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00500v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents exhibit powerful autonomous capabilities across domains such as robotics, virtual assistants, and web automation. However, their stochastic behavior introduces significant safety risks that are difficult to anticipate. Existing rule-based enforcement systems, such as AgentSpec, focus on developing reactive safety rules, which typically respond only when unsafe behavior is imminent or has already occurred. These systems lack foresight and struggle with long-horizon dependencies and distribution shifts. To address these limitations, we propose Pro2Guard, a proactive runtime enforcement framework grounded in probabilistic reachability analysis. Pro2Guard abstracts agent behaviors into symbolic states and learns a Discrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) from execution traces. At runtime, it anticipates future risks by estimating the probability of reaching unsafe states, triggering interventions before violations occur when the predicted risk exceeds a user-defined threshold. By incorporating semantic validity checks and leveraging PAC bounds, Pro2Guard ensures statistical reliability while approximating the underlying ground-truth model. We evaluate Pro2Guard extensively across two safety-critical domains: embodied household agents and autonomous vehicles. In embodied agent tasks, Pro2Guard enforces safety early on up to 93.6% of unsafe tasks using low thresholds, while configurable modes (e.g., reflect) allow balancing safety with task success, maintaining up to 80.4% task completion. In autonomous driving scenarios, Pro2Guard achieves 100% prediction of traffic law violations and collisions, anticipating risks up to 38.66 seconds ahead.</p></details> |  |

However, such reasoning abilities remain underexplored and notably absent in vision foundation models, including representation models like the DINO series. In this work, we propose \textbf{DINO-R1}, the first such attempt to incentivize visual in-context reasoning capabilities of vision foundation models using reinforcement learning. Specifically, DINO-R1 introduces \textbf{Group Relative Query Optimization (GRQO)}, a novel reinforcement-style training strategy explicitly designed for query-based representation models, which computes query-level rewards based on group-normalized alignment quality. We also apply KL-regularization to stabilize the objectness distribution to reduce the training instability. This joint optimization enables dense and expressive supervision across queries while mitigating overfitting and distributional drift. Building upon Grounding-DINO, we train a series of DINO-R1 family models that integrate a visual prompt encoder and a visual-guided query selection mechanism. Extensive experiments on COCO, LVIS, and ODinW demonstrate that DINO-R1 significantly outperforms supervised fine-tuning baselines, achieving strong generalization in both open-vocabulary and closed-set visual prompting scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[IFEvalCode: Controlled Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22462v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code large language models (Code LLMs) have made significant progress in code generation by translating natural language descriptions into functional code; however, real-world applications often demand stricter adherence to detailed requirements such as coding style, line count, and structural constraints, beyond mere correctness. To address this, the paper introduces forward and backward constraints generation to improve the instruction-following capabilities of Code LLMs in controlled code generation, ensuring outputs align more closely with human-defined guidelines. The authors further present IFEvalCode, a multilingual benchmark comprising 1.6K test samples across seven programming languages (Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Shell, C++, and C#), with each sample featuring both Chinese and English queries. Unlike existing benchmarks, IFEvalCode decouples evaluation into two metrics: correctness (Corr.) and instruction-following (Instr.), enabling a more nuanced assessment. Experiments on over 40 LLMs reveal that closed-source models outperform open-source ones in controllable code generation and highlight a significant gap between the models' ability to generate correct code versus code that precisely follows instructions.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Sign Spotting Disambiguation using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03703v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sign spotting, the task of identifying and localizing individual signs within continuous sign language video, plays a pivotal role in scaling dataset annotations and addressing the severe data scarcity issue in sign language translation. While automatic sign spotting holds great promise for enabling frame-level supervision at scale, it grapples with challenges such as vocabulary inflexibility and ambiguity inherent in continuous sign streams. Hence, we introduce a novel, training-free framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to significantly enhance sign spotting quality. Our approach extracts global spatio-temporal and hand shape features, which are then matched against a large-scale sign dictionary using dynamic time warping and cosine similarity. This dictionary-based matching inherently offers superior vocabulary flexibility without requiring model retraining. To mitigate noise and ambiguity from the matching process, an LLM performs context-aware gloss disambiguation via beam search, notably without fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world sign language datasets demonstrate our method's superior accuracy and sentence fluency compared to traditional approaches, highlighting the potential of LLMs in advancing sign spotting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the international conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVA Adjunct)</p></details> |
| **[CyGATE: Game-Theoretic Cyber Attack-Defense Engine for Patch Strategy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00478v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern cyber attacks unfold through multiple stages, requiring defenders to dynamically prioritize mitigations under uncertainty. While game-theoretic models capture attacker-defender interactions, existing approaches often rely on static assumptions and lack integration with real-time threat intelligence, limiting their adaptability. This paper presents CyGATE, a game-theoretic framework modeling attacker-defender interactions, using large language models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to enhance tactic selection and patch prioritization. Applied to a two-agent scenario, CyGATE frames cyber conflicts as a partially observable stochastic game (POSG) across Cyber Kill Chain stages. Both agents use belief states to navigate uncertainty, with the attacker adapting tactics and the defender re-prioritizing patches based on evolving risks and observed adversary behavior. The framework's flexible architecture enables extension to multi-agent scenarios involving coordinated attackers, collaborative defenders, or complex enterprise environments with multiple stakeholders. Evaluated in a dynamic patch scheduling scenario, CyGATE effectively prioritizes high-risk vulnerabilities, enhancing adaptability through dynamic threat integration, strategic foresight by anticipating attacker moves under uncertainty, and efficiency by optimizing resource use.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAG-R1 : Incentivize the Search and Reasoning Capabilities of LLMs through Multi-query Parallelism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02962v4)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, while LLMs remain prone to generating hallucinated or outdated responses due to their static internal knowledge. Recent advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods have aimed to enhance models' search and reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL). Although these methods demonstrate promising results, they face challenges in training stability and encounter issues such as substantial inference time and restricted capabilities due to reliance on single-query mode. In this paper, we propose RAG-R1, a novel training framework designed to enable LLMs to adaptively leverage internal and external knowledge during the reasoning process. We further expand the generation and retrieval processes within the framework from single-query mode to multi-query parallelism, with the aim of reducing inference time and enhancing the model's capabilities. Extensive experiments on seven question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the strongest baseline by up to 13.2% and decreases inference time by 11.1%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Thinking Machines: Mathematical Reasoning in the Age of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00459v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable abilities in structured reasoning and symbolic tasks, with coding emerging as a particular area of strength. This success has sparked growing interest in applying LLMs to mathematics, both in informal problem-solving and formal theorem proving. However, progress in formal mathematics has proven to be significantly more difficult, despite surface-level similarities between programming and proof construction. This discrepancy raises important questions about how LLMs ``reason'', how they are supervised, and whether they internally track a notion of computational or deductive state. In this article, we address the state-of-the-art of the discipline, focusing on recent models and benchmarks, and explore three central issues at the intersection of machine learning and mathematical cognition: (i) the trade-offs between formal and informal mathematics as training domains; (ii) the deeper reasons why proof generation remains more brittle than code synthesis; (iii) and the question of whether LLMs represent, or merely mimic, a notion of evolving logical state. Our goal is not to draw hard boundaries, but to identify where the current limits lie, and how they might be extended.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning an Efficient Multi-Turn Dialogue Evaluator from Multiple Judges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00454v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating the conversational abilities of large language models (LLMs) remains a challenging task. Current mainstream approaches primarily rely on the ``LLM-as-a-judge" paradigm, where an LLM is prompted to serve as an evaluator to assess dialogue quality. However, such methods often suffer from various biases, which undermine the reliability and consistency of the evaluation results. To mitigate these biases, recent methods employ multiple LLMs as judges and aggregate their judgments to select the optimal assessment. Although effective, this multi-judge approach incurs significant computational overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-turn dialogue evaluator that captures the collective wisdom of multiple LLM judges by aggregating their preference knowledge into a single model. Our approach preserves the advantages of diverse multi-judge feedback while drastically reducing the evaluation cost, enabling fast and flexible dialogue quality assessment. Extensive experiments on seven single rating and pairwise comparison dialogue evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines across diverse scenarios, showcasing its efficiency and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 2 pages, under review at AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[When Relevance Meets Novelty: Dual-Stable Periodic Optimization for Exploratory Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00450v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional recommendation systems tend to trap users in strong feedback loops by excessively pushing content aligned with their historical preferences, thereby limiting exploration opportunities and causing content fatigue. Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate potential with their diverse content generation capabilities, existing LLM-enhanced dual-model frameworks face two major limitations: first, they overlook long-term preferences driven by group identity, leading to biased interest modeling; second, they suffer from static optimization flaws, as a one-time alignment process fails to leverage incremental user data for closed-loop optimization. To address these challenges, we propose the Co-Evolutionary Alignment (CoEA) method. For interest modeling bias, we introduce Dual-Stable Interest Exploration (DSIE) module, jointly modeling long-term group identity and short-term individual interests through parallel processing of behavioral sequences. For static optimization limitations, we design a Periodic Collaborative Optimization (PCO) mechanism. This mechanism regularly conducts preference verification on incremental data using the Relevance LLM, then guides the Novelty LLM to perform fine-tuning based on the verification results, and subsequently feeds back the output of the incrementally fine-tuned Novelty LLM to the Relevance LLM for re-evaluation, thereby achieving a dynamic closed-loop optimization. Extensive online and offline experiments verify the effectiveness of the CoEA model in exploratory recommendation.</p></details> |  |

Publicly available general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) typically offer generic agriculture advisories, lacking precision in local and multilingual contexts. Our study addresses this limitation by generating multilingual (English, Hindi, Punjabi) synthetic datasets from agriculture-specific documents from India and fine-tuning LLMs for the task of question answering (QA). Evaluation on human-created datasets demonstrates significant improvements in factuality, relevance, and agricultural consensus for the fine-tuned LLMs compared to the baseline counterparts.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 tables, Appendix A-L</p></details> |
| **[Automated Type Annotation in Python Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00422v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Type annotations in Python enhance maintainability and error detection. However, generating these annotations manually is error prone and requires extra effort. Traditional automation approaches like static analysis, machine learning, and deep learning struggle with limited type vocabularies, behavioral over approximation, and reliance on large labeled datasets. In this work, we explore the use of LLMs for generating type annotations in Python. We develop a generate check repair pipeline: the LLM proposes annotations guided by a Concrete Syntax Tree representation, a static type checker (Mypy) verifies them, and any errors are fed back for iterative refinement. We evaluate four LLM variants: GPT 4oMini, GPT 4.1mini (general-purpose), and O3Mini, O4Mini (reasoning optimized), on 6000 code snippets from the ManyTypes4Py benchmark. We first measure the proportion of code snippets annotated by LLMs for which MyPy reported no errors (i.e., consistent results): GPT 4oMini achieved consistency on 65.9% of cases (34.1% inconsistent), while GPT 4.1mini, O3Mini, and O4Mini each reached approximately 88.6% consistency (around 11.4% failures). To measure annotation quality, we then compute exact-match and base-type match accuracies over all 6000 snippets: GPT 4.1mini and O3Mini perform the best, achieving up to 70.5% exact match and 79.1% base type accuracy, requiring under one repair iteration on average. Our results demonstrate that general-purpose and reasoning optimized LLMs, without any task specific fine tuning or additional training can be effective in generating consistent type annotations.They perform competitively with traditional deep learning techniques which require large labeled dataset for training. While our work focuses on Python, the pipeline can be extended to other optionally typed imperative languages like Ruby</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Loop Invariant Generation: A Hybrid Framework of Reasoning optimised LLMs and SMT Solvers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00419v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loop invariants are essential for proving the correctness of programs with loops. Developing loop invariants is challenging, and fully automatic synthesis cannot be guaranteed for arbitrary programs. Some approaches have been proposed to synthesize loop invariants using symbolic techniques and more recently using neural approaches. These approaches are able to correctly synthesize loop invariants only for subsets of standard benchmarks. In this work, we investigate whether modern, reasoning-optimized large language models can do better. We integrate OpenAI's O1, O1-mini, and O3-mini into a tightly coupled generate-and-check pipeline with the Z3 SMT solver, using solver counterexamples to iteratively guide invariant refinement. We use Code2Inv benchmark, which provides C programs along with their formal preconditions and postconditions. On this benchmark of 133 tasks, our framework achieves 100% coverage (133 out of 133), outperforming the previous best of 107 out of 133, while requiring only 1-2 model proposals per instance and 14-55 seconds of wall-clock time. These results demonstrate that LLMs possess latent logical reasoning capabilities which can help automate loop invariant synthesis. While our experiments target C-specific programs, this approach should be generalizable to other imperative languages.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Co-Reward: Self-supervised Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Model Reasoning via Contrastive Agreement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00410v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) shows promise in improving the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs), the scaling up dilemma remains due to the reliance on human annotated labels especially for complex tasks. Recent alternatives that explore various self-reward signals exhibit the eliciting potential of LLM reasoning, but suffer from the non-negligible collapse issue. Inspired by the success of self-supervised learning, we propose \textit{Co-Reward}, a novel RL framework that leverages contrastive agreement across semantically analogical questions as a reward basis. Specifically, we construct a similar question for each training sample (without labels) and synthesize their individual surrogate labels through a simple rollout voting, and then the reward is constructed by cross-referring the labels of each question pair to enforce the internal reasoning consistency across analogical inputs. Intuitively, such a self-supervised reward-shaping mechanism increases the difficulty of learning collapse into a trivial solution, and promotes stable reasoning elicitation and improvement through expanding the input sample variants. Empirically, Co-Reward achieves superior performance compared to other self-reward baselines on multiple reasoning benchmarks and LLM series, and reaches or even surpasses ground-truth (GT) labeled reward, with improvements of up to $+6.8\%$ on MATH500 over GT reward on Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/tmlr-group/Co-Reward.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking LLMs for Unit Test Generation from Real-World Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00408v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in automating unit test generation, significantly reducing the manual effort required by developers. To effectively evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in this domain, it is crucial to have a well-designed benchmark that accurately reflects real-world scenarios and mitigates common pitfalls. Existing LLM test generation benchmarks are limited by two critical drawbacks: data contamination and structurally simple function code. As a result, we often cannot rely on the validity of scientific conclusions drawn from empirical studies using these limited benchmarks. The empirical evidence presented may be biased due to contamination and may fail to generalize beyond toy programs due to structural simplicity. To address these problems, we introduce ULT (UnLeakedTestbench), a new benchmark specifically designed for function-level unit test generation from real-world Python functions. ULT is constructed through a multi-stage curation process that ensures high cyclomatic complexity and mitigates test case contamination. With 3,909 carefully selected function-level tasks, ULT provides a more realistic and challenging evaluation of LLMs' test generation capabilities. We also provide PLT (PreLeakedTestbench), a pair benchmark of ULT with leaked tests designed to enable a controlled analysis of memorization versus reasoning in test generation. Our evaluation results demonstrate that ULT is significantly more challenging. For example, test cases generated by LLMs only achieve 41.32\%, 45.10\%, 30.22\%, and 40.21\% for accuracy, statement coverage, branch coverage, and mutation score on average for all LLMs, respectively. These results are substantially lower than the corresponding metrics on TestEval (91.79\%, 92.18\%, 82.04\%, and 49.69\%) and PLT (47.07\%, 55.13\%, 40.07\%, and 50.80\%).</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Cued-Agent: A Collaborative Multi-Agent System for Automatic Cued Speech Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00391v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cued Speech (CS) is a visual communication system that combines lip-reading with hand coding to facilitate communication for individuals with hearing impairments. Automatic CS Recognition (ACSR) aims to convert CS hand gestures and lip movements into text via AI-driven methods. Traditionally, the temporal asynchrony between hand and lip movements requires the design of complex modules to facilitate effective multimodal fusion. However, constrained by limited data availability, current methods demonstrate insufficient capacity for adequately training these fusion mechanisms, resulting in suboptimal performance. Recently, multi-agent systems have shown promising capabilities in handling complex tasks with limited data availability. To this end, we propose the first collaborative multi-agent system for ACSR, named Cued-Agent. It integrates four specialized sub-agents: a Multimodal Large Language Model-based Hand Recognition agent that employs keyframe screening and CS expert prompt strategies to decode hand movements, a pretrained Transformer-based Lip Recognition agent that extracts lip features from the input video, a Hand Prompt Decoding agent that dynamically integrates hand prompts with lip features during inference in a training-free manner, and a Self-Correction Phoneme-to-Word agent that enables post-process and end-to-end conversion from phoneme sequences to natural language sentences for the first time through semantic refinement. To support this study, we expand the existing Mandarin CS dataset by collecting data from eight hearing-impaired cuers, establishing a mixed dataset of fourteen subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Cued-Agent performs superbly in both normal and hearing-impaired scenarios compared with state-of-the-art methods. The implementation is available at https://github.com/DennisHgj/Cued-Agent.</p></details> | 9 pages |

These studies have sought to understand the perspectives of novice developers on using these tools, a critical aspect of the successful adoption of LLMs in software engineering. To systematically collect and summarise these studies, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) following the guidelines by Kitchenham et al. on 80 primary studies published between April 2022 and June 2025 to answer four research questions (RQs). In answering RQ1, we categorised the study motivations and methodological approaches. In RQ2, we identified the software development tasks for which novice developers use LLMs. In RQ3, we categorised the advantages, challenges, and recommendations discussed in the studies. Finally, we discuss the study limitations and future research needs suggested in the primary studies in answering RQ4. Throughout the paper, we also indicate directions for future work and implications for software engineering researchers, educators, and developers.

While existing KV cache optimizations improve memory efficiency, they often fail to reduce time to first token (TTFT) and may degrade performance through token pruning. Alternative sequence modeling architectures address some of these limitations, but typically require full retraining and lack infrastructure support. EdgeInfinite offers an efficient solution by fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters, maintaining quality while reducing both computational and memory costs, including improved TTFT. However, its instruction-following ability is limited, and it lacks mobile-specific optimizations. To address these issues, we propose EdgeInfinite-Instruct, which introduces a Segmented Supervised Fine-Tuning (S-SFT) strategy tailored to long-sequence tasks such as summarization and question answering. We further optimized EdgeInfinite-Instruct for efficient deployment on edge NPUs by employing fine-grained post-training quantization (PTQ) to reduce computational demands while maintaining accuracy, and by implementing a fixed-shape computation graph that balances memory usage and on-device efficiency through scenario-specific customization of input token and cache sizes. Experiments on long-context benchmarks and real-world mobile tasks show that our approach improves domain-specific performance while maintaining efficiency on NPU-accelerated edge devices.</p></details> | 9 pages |

Although CLIP is successfully trained on billion-scale image-text pairs from the English world, scaling CLIP's training further to learning from the worldwide web data is still challenging: (1) no curation method is available to handle data points from non-English world; (2) the English performance from existing multilingual CLIP is worse than its English-only counterpart, i.e., "curse of multilinguality" that is common in LLMs. Here, we present Meta CLIP 2, the first recipe training CLIP from scratch on worldwide web-scale image-text pairs. To generalize our findings, we conduct rigorous ablations with minimal changes that are necessary to address the above challenges and present a recipe enabling mutual benefits from English and non-English world data. In zero-shot ImageNet classification, Meta CLIP 2 ViT-H/14 surpasses its English-only counterpart by 0.8% and mSigLIP by 0.7%, and surprisingly sets new state-of-the-art without system-level confounding factors (e.g., translation, bespoke architecture changes) on multilingual benchmarks, such as CVQA with 57.4%, Babel-ImageNet with 50.2% and XM3600 with 64.3% on image-to-text retrieval.</p></details> | 10 pages |

In the context of integrated circuit design, modern flows (e.g., going from a register-transfer level netlist to physical layouts) involve extensive configuration via thousands of parameters, and small changes to these parameters can have large downstream impacts on desired outcomes - namely design performance, power, and area. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for learning and reasoning within such high-dimensional optimization tasks. In this work, we introduce ORFS-agent, an LLM-based iterative optimization agent that automates parameter tuning in an open-source hardware design flow. ORFS-agent adaptively explores parameter configurations, demonstrating clear improvements over standard Bayesian optimization approaches in terms of resource efficiency and final design metrics. Our empirical evaluations on two different technology nodes and a range of circuit benchmarks indicate that ORFS-agent can improve both routed wirelength and effective clock period by over 13%, all while using 40% fewer optimization iterations. Moreover, by following natural language objectives to trade off certain metrics for others, ORFS-agent demonstrates a flexible and interpretable framework for multi-objective optimization. Crucially, RFS-agent is modular and model-agnostic, and can be plugged in to any frontier LLM without any further fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

Among these, program-guided reasoning, by decomposing claims into function calls and executing reasoning programs, which has shown particular promise, but remains limited by the need for manually crafted demonstrations. Fundamentally, the underlying principles of effective reasoning program generation still remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce BOOST, a bootstrapping approach for automated few-shot reasoning program generation. BOOST iteratively refines explicit, data-driven guidelines as meta-rules for guiding demonstration creation, using a critique-refine loop that eliminates the need for human intervention. This enables a seamless transition from zero-shot to few-shot program-guided learning, enhancing interpretability and effectiveness. Experimental results show that BOOST outperforms prior few-shot baselines in both zero-shot and few-shot settings for complex claim verification.</p></details> | Work in Progress |

Despite their potential, existing work faces challenges when deploying LLMs in agent-based environments. The widely adopted agent paradigm ReAct centers on integrating single-step reasoning with immediate action execution, which limits its effectiveness in complex tasks requiring long-term strategic planning. Furthermore, the coordination between the planner and executor during problem-solving is also a critical factor to consider in agent design. Additionally, current approaches predominantly rely on supervised fine-tuning, which often leads models to memorize established task completion trajectories, thereby restricting their generalization ability when confronted with novel problem contexts. To address these challenges, we introduce an adaptive global plan-based agent paradigm AdaPlan, aiming to synergize high-level explicit guidance with execution to support effective long-horizon decision-making. Based on the proposed paradigm, we further put forward PilotRL, a global planning-guided training framework for LLM agents driven by progressive reinforcement learning. We first develop the model's ability to follow explicit guidance from global plans when addressing agent tasks. Subsequently, based on this foundation, we focus on optimizing the quality of generated plans. Finally, we conduct joint optimization of the model's planning and execution coordination. Experiments indicate that PilotRL could achieve state-of-the-art performances, with LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + PilotRL surpassing closed-sourced GPT-4o by 3.60%, while showing a more substantial gain of 55.78% comparing to GPT-4o-mini at a comparable parameter scale.</p></details> |  |

Rethinking Large Language Model Benchmarking with Item Response Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15055v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evaluation of large language models (LLMs) via benchmarks is widespread, yet inconsistencies between different leaderboards and poor separability among top models raise concerns about their ability to accurately reflect authentic model capabilities. This paper provides a critical analysis of benchmark effectiveness, examining mainstream prominent LLM benchmarks using results from diverse models. We first propose Pseudo-Siamese Network for Item Response Theory (PSN-IRT), an enhanced Item Response Theory framework that incorporates a rich set of item parameters within an IRT-grounded architecture. PSN-IRT can be utilized for accurate and reliable estimations of item characteristics and model abilities. Based on PSN-IRT, we conduct extensive analysis on 11 LLM benchmarks comprising 41,871 items, revealing significant and varied shortcomings in their measurement quality. Furthermore, we demonstrate that leveraging PSN-IRT is able to construct smaller benchmarks while maintaining stronger alignment with human preference.</p></details> |  |

Evaluating and analyzing their logical reasoning abilities has therefore become essential. However, existing datasets and benchmarks are often limited to overly simplistic, unnatural, or contextually constrained examples. In response to the growing demand, we introduce SmartyPat-Bench, a challenging, naturally expressed, and systematically labeled benchmark derived from real-world high-quality Reddit posts containing subtle logical fallacies. Unlike existing datasets and benchmarks, it provides more detailed annotations of logical fallacies and features more diverse data. To further scale up the study and address the limitations of manual data collection and labeling - such as fallacy-type imbalance and labor-intensive annotation - we introduce SmartyPat, an automated framework powered by logic programming-based oracles. SmartyPat utilizes Prolog rules to systematically generate logically fallacious statements, which are then refined into fluent natural-language sentences by LLMs, ensuring precise fallacy representation. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that SmartyPat produces fallacies comparable in subtlety and quality to human-generated content and significantly outperforms baseline methods. Finally, experiments reveal nuanced insights into LLM capabilities, highlighting that while excessive reasoning steps hinder fallacy detection accuracy, structured reasoning enhances fallacy categorization performance.</p></details> |  |

Existing privacy controls are often static and coarse-grained, failing to accommodate the dynamic and socially nuanced nature of home environments. This paper investigates the viability of using Large Language Models (LLMs) as the core of a dynamic and adaptive privacy policy engine. We propose a conceptual framework where visual data is classified using a multi-dimensional schema that considers data sensitivity, spatial context, and social presence. An LLM then reasons over this contextual information to enforce fine-grained privacy rules, such as selective object obfuscation, in real-time. Through a comparative evaluation of state-of-the-art Vision Language Models (including GPT-4o and the Qwen-VL series) in simulated home settings , our findings show the feasibility of this approach. The LLM-based engine achieved a top machine-evaluated appropriateness score of 3.99 out of 5, and the policies generated by the models received a top human-evaluated score of 4.00 out of 5.</p></details> |  |

Most existing approaches attempt to improve Operations Research (OR) optimization problem-solving through prompt engineering or fine-tuning strategies for LLMs. However, these methods are fundamentally constrained by the limited capabilities of non-reasoning LLMs. To overcome these limitations, we propose OR-LLM-Agent, an AI agent framework built on reasoning LLMs for automated OR problem solving. The framework decomposes the task into three sequential stages: mathematical modeling, code generation, and debugging. Each task is handled by a dedicated sub-agent, which enables more targeted reasoning. We also construct BWOR, an OR dataset for evaluating LLM performance on OR tasks. Our analysis shows that in the benchmarks NL4OPT, MAMO, and IndustryOR, reasoning LLMs sometimes underperform their non-reasoning counterparts within the same model family. In contrast, BWOR provides a more consistent and discriminative assessment of model capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that OR-LLM-Agent utilizing DeepSeek-R1 in its framework outperforms advanced methods, including GPT-o3, Gemini 2.5 Pro, DeepSeek-R1, and ORLM, by at least 7\% in accuracy. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of task decomposition for OR problem solving.</p></details> | 8 pages, 13 figures |

However, the rapid pace of their deployment has outpaced a comprehensive understanding of their internal mechanisms and a delineation of their capabilities and limitations. A desired attribute of an intelligent system is its ability to recognize the scope of its own knowledge. To investigate whether LLMs embody this characteristic, we develop a benchmark designed to challenge these models to enumerate all information they possess on specific topics. This benchmark evaluates whether the models recall excessive, insufficient, or the precise amount of information, thereby indicating their awareness of their own knowledge. Our findings reveal that all tested LLMs, given sufficient scale, demonstrate an understanding of how much they know about specific topics. While different architectures exhibit varying rates of this capability's emergence, the results suggest that awareness of knowledge may be a generalizable attribute of LLMs. Further research is needed to confirm this potential and fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>ublis...</summary><p>ublished as a long paper at the 2024 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP).

| **[Systematic Evaluation of Optimization Techniques for Long-Context Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00305v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel across diverse natural language processing tasks but face resource demands and limited context windows. Although techniques like pruning, quantization, and token dropping can mitigate these issues, their efficacy in long-context scenarios and system evaluation remains underexplored. This paper systematically benchmarks these optimizations, characterizing memory usage, latency, and throughput, and studies how these methods impact the quality of text generation. We first analyze individual optimization methods for two LLM architectures supporting long context and then systematically evaluate combinations of these techniques to assess how this deeper analysis impacts performance metrics. We subsequently study the scalability of individual optimization methods on a larger variant with 70 billion-parameter model. Our novel insights reveal that naive combination inference optimization algorithms can adversely affect larger models due to compounded approximation errors, as compared to their smaller counterparts. Experiments show that relying solely on F1 obscures these effects by hiding precision-recall trade-offs in question answering tasks. By integrating system-level profiling with task-specific insights, this study helps LLM practitioners and researchers explore and balance efficiency, accuracy, and scalability across tasks and hardware configurations.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we introduce MetaExplainer, a neuro-symbolic framework designed to generate user-centered explanations. Our approach employs a three-stage process: first, we decompose user questions into machine-readable formats using state-of-the-art large language models (LLM); second, we delegate the task of generating system recommendations to model explainer methods; and finally, we synthesize natural language explanations that summarize the explainer outputs. Throughout this process, we utilize an Explanation Ontology to guide the language models and explainer methods. By leveraging LLMs and a structured approach to explanation generation, MetaExplainer aims to enhance the interpretability and trustworthiness of AI systems across various applications, providing users with tailored, question-driven explanations that better meet their needs. Comprehensive evaluations of MetaExplainer demonstrate a step towards evaluating and utilizing current state-of-the-art explanation frameworks. Our results show high performance across all stages, with a 59.06% F1-score in question reframing, 70% faithfulness in model explanations, and 67% context-utilization in natural language synthesis. User studies corroborate these findings, highlighting the creativity and comprehensiveness of generated explanations. Tested on the Diabetes (PIMA Indian) tabular dataset, MetaExplainer supports diverse explanation types, including Contrastive, Counterfactual, Rationale, Case-Based, and Data explanations. The framework's versatility and traceability from using ontology to guide LLMs suggest broad applicability beyond the tested scenarios, positioning MetaExplainer as a promising tool for enhancing AI explainability across various domains.</p></details> |  |

However, their diagnostic reliability in complex clinical scenarios remains limited. This study aims to enhance LLMs' diagnostic accuracy and clinical reasoning ability. Method: We propose an Etiology-Aware Attention Steering Framework to integrate structured clinical reasoning into LLM-based diagnosis. Specifically, we first construct Clinical Reasoning Scaffolding (CRS) based on authoritative clinical guidelines for three representative acute abdominal emergencies: acute appendicitis, acute pancreatitis, and acute cholecystitis. Next, we develop the Etiology-Aware Head Identification algorithm to pinpoint attention heads crucial for the model's etiology reasoning. To ensure reliable clinical reasoning alignment, we introduce the Reasoning-Guided Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning that embeds etiological reasoning cues into input representations and steers the selected Etiology-Aware Heads toward critical information through a Reasoning-Guided Loss function. Result: On the Consistent Diagnosis Cohort, our framework improves average diagnostic accuracy by 15.65% and boosts the average Reasoning Focus Score by 31.6% over baselines. External validation on the Discrepant Diagnosis Cohort further confirms its effectiveness in enhancing diagnostic accuracy. Further assessments via Reasoning Attention Frequency indicate that our models exhibit enhanced reliability when faced with real-world complex scenarios. Conclusion: This study presents a practical and effective approach to enhance clinical reasoning in LLM-based diagnosis. By aligning model attention with structured CRS, the proposed framework offers a promising paradigm for building more interpretable and reliable AI diagnostic systems in complex clinical settings.</p></details> | 23 pages, 8 figures |

While generative agents powered by large language models (LLMs) aim to simulate this complex behavior, it remains uncertain whether they operate on similar cognitive principles. To address this, we conducted a task-generation experiment comparing human responses with those of an LLM agent (GPT-4o). We find that human task generation is consistently influenced by psychological drivers, including personal values (e.g., Openness to Change) and cognitive style. Even when these psychological drivers are explicitly provided to the LLM, it fails to reflect the corresponding behavioral patterns. They produce tasks that are markedly less social, less physical, and thematically biased toward abstraction. Interestingly, while the LLM's tasks were perceived as more fun and novel, this highlights a disconnect between its linguistic proficiency and its capacity to generate human-like, embodied goals.We conclude that there is a core gap between the value-driven, embodied nature of human cognition and the statistical patterns of LLMs, highlighting the necessity of incorporating intrinsic motivation and physical grounding into the design of more human-aligned agents.</p></details> |  |

This task plays a crucial role in practical applications requiring accurate object perception based on user instructions. Over the past decade, it has gained significant attention in the multimodal community, driven by advances in convolutional neural networks, transformers, and large language models, all of which have substantially improved multimodal perception capabilities. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of multimodal referring segmentation. We begin by introducing this field's background, including problem definitions and commonly used datasets. Next, we summarize a unified meta architecture for referring segmentation and review representative methods across three primary visual scenes, including images, videos, and 3D scenes. We further discuss Generalized Referring Expression (GREx) methods to address the challenges of real-world complexity, along with related tasks and practical applications. Extensive performance comparisons on standard benchmarks are also provided.

However, understanding how this impacts confidence calibration for reliable model output has not been researched in full. In this work, we examine various open-sourced LLMs, identifying significant calibration degradation after instruction tuning in each. Seeking a practical solution, we look towards label smoothing, which has been shown as an effective method to regularize for overconfident predictions but has yet to be widely adopted in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of LLMs. We first provide insight as to why label smoothing is sufficient to maintain calibration throughout the SFT process. However, settings remain where the effectiveness of smoothing is severely diminished, in particular the case of large vocabulary LLMs (LV-LLMs). We posit the cause to stem from the ability to become over-confident, which has a direct relationship with the hidden size and vocabulary size, and justify this theoretically and experimentally. Finally, we address an outstanding issue regarding the memory footprint of the cross-entropy loss computation in the label smoothed loss setting, designing a customized kernel to dramatically reduce memory consumption without sacrificing speed or performance in comparison to existing solutions for non-smoothed losses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the Forty-second International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) 2025.

Recent methods update a visual projector to translate visual information for new tasks, connecting pre-trained vision encoders with large language models. However, such adjustments may cause the models to prioritize visual inputs over language instructions, particularly learning tasks with repetitive types of textual instructions. To address the neglect of language instructions, we propose a novel framework that grounds the translation of visual information on instructions for language models. We introduce a mixture of visual projectors, each serving as a specialized visual-to-language translation expert based on the given instruction context to adapt to new tasks. To avoid using experts for irrelevant instruction contexts, we propose an expert recommendation strategy that reuses experts for tasks similar to those previously learned. Additionally, we introduce expert pruning to alleviate interference from the use of experts that cumulatively activated in previous tasks. Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing continual learning approaches by generating instruction-following responses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |

However, compared with traditional wireless networks, LAWNs face unique security challenges due to low-altitude operations, frequent mobility and reliance on unlicensed spectrum, making it more vulnerable to some malicious attacks. In this paper, we investigate some large artificial intelligence model (LAM)-enabled solutions for secure communications in LAWNs. Specifically, we first explore the amplified security risks and important limitations of traditional AI methods in LAWNs. Then, we introduce the basic concepts of LAMs and delve into the role of LAMs in addressing these challenges. To demonstrate the practical benefits of LAMs for secure communications in LAWNs, we propose a novel LAM-based optimization framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate enhanced state features on top of handcrafted representations, and to design intrinsic rewards accordingly, thereby improving reinforcement learning performance for secure communication tasks. Through a typical case study, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Finally, we outline future directions for integrating LAMs into secure LAWN applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to IEEE Communications Magazine for consideration</p></details> |

With the rise of large language models (LLMs), there is a growing interest in using LLMs for graph model generation. Nevertheless, LLM-based graph model generation typically produces partially correct models that suffer from three main issues: (1) syntax violations: the generated model may not adhere to the syntax defined by its metamodel, (2) constraint inconsistencies: the structure of the model might not conform to some domain-specific constraints, and (3) inaccuracy: due to the inherent uncertainty in LLMs, the models can include inaccurate, hallucinated elements. While the first issue is often addressed through techniques such as constraint decoding or filtering, the latter two remain largely unaddressed. Motivated by recent self-consistency approaches in LLMs, we propose a novel abstraction-concretization framework that enhances the consistency and quality of generated graph models by considering multiple outputs from an LLM. Our approach first constructs a probabilistic partial model that aggregates all candidate outputs and then refines this partial model into the most appropriate concrete model that satisfies all constraints. We evaluate our framework on several popular open-source and closed-source LLMs using diverse datasets for model generation tasks. The results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves both the consistency and quality of the generated graph models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACM / IEEE 28th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems (MODELS 2025)</p></details> |

However, their pre-trained architectures often reveal limitations in specialized contexts, including restricted reasoning capacities, ethical uncertainties, and suboptimal domain-specific performance. These challenges necessitate advanced post-training language models (PoLMs) to address these shortcomings, such as OpenAI-o1/o3 and DeepSeek-R1 (collectively known as Large Reasoning Models, or LRMs). This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of PoLMs, systematically tracing their evolution across five core paradigms: Fine-tuning, which enhances task-specific accuracy; Alignment, which ensures ethical coherence and alignment with human preferences; Reasoning, which advances multi-step inference despite challenges in reward design; Efficiency, which optimizes resource utilization amidst increasing complexity; Integration and Adaptation, which extend capabilities across diverse modalities while addressing coherence issues. Charting progress from ChatGPT's alignment strategies to DeepSeek-R1's innovative reasoning advancements, we illustrate how PoLMs leverage datasets to mitigate biases, deepen reasoning capabilities, and enhance domain adaptability. Our contributions include a pioneering synthesis of PoLM evolution, a structured taxonomy categorizing techniques and datasets, and a strategic agenda emphasizing the role of LRMs in improving reasoning proficiency and domain flexibility. As the first survey of its scope, this work consolidates recent PoLM advancements and establishes a rigorous intellectual framework for future research, fostering the development of LLMs that excel in precision, ethical robustness, and versatility across scientific and societal applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>87 pa...</summary><p>87 pages, 21 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

While existing approaches -- ranging from vector space models to deep learning models -- have shown potential in this domain, their effectiveness is often limited by the vocabulary mismatch between bug reports and source code. To address this issue, we propose a novel Large Language Model (LLM) based bug localization approach, called GenLoc. Given a bug report, GenLoc leverages an LLM equipped with code-exploration functions to iteratively analyze the code base and identify potential buggy files. To gather better context, GenLoc may optionally retrieve semantically relevant files using vector embeddings. GenLoc has been evaluated on over 9,000 real-world bug reports from six large-scale Java projects. Experimental results show that GenLoc outperforms five state-of-the-art bug localization techniques across multiple metrics, achieving an average improvement of more than 60\% in Accuracy@1.</p></details> |  |

Despite these advancements, existing reasoning LLMs often generate unnecessarily lengthy reasoning processes, leading to significant computational overhead and response latency. These limitations hinder their practical deployment in real-world clinical environments. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{ControlMed}, a medical language model that enables users to actively control the length of the reasoning process at inference time through fine-grained control markers. ControlMed is trained through a three-stage pipeline: 1) pre-training on a large-scale synthetic medical instruction dataset covering both \textit{direct} and \textit{reasoning responses}; 2) supervised fine-tuning with multi-length reasoning data and explicit length-control markers; and 3) reinforcement learning with model-based reward signals to enhance factual accuracy and response quality. Experimental results on a variety of English and Korean medical benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves similar or better performance compared to state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, users can flexibly balance reasoning accuracy and computational efficiency by controlling the reasoning length as needed. These findings demonstrate that ControlMed is a practical and adaptable solution for clinical question answering and medical information analysis.</p></details> | 13 pages |

Reference models, critical for accelerating the verification process, are themselves becoming more intricate and time-consuming to develop. Despite the promise shown by large language models (LLMs) in code programming, effectively generating complex reference models remains a significant hurdle. To address these challenges, we introduce ChatModel, the first LLM-aided agile reference model generation and verification platform. ChatModel streamlines the transition from design specifications to fully functional reference models by integrating design standardization and hierarchical agile modeling. Employing a building-block generation strategy, it not only enhances the design capabilities of LLMs for reference models but also significantly boosts verification efficiency. We evaluated ChatModel on 300 designs of varying complexity, demonstrating substantial improvements in both efficiency and quality of reference model generation. ChatModel achieved a peak performance improvement of 55.02% compared to alternative methods, with notable enhancements in generation stability, and delivered a 9.18x increase in its capacity to produce reference model designs. Furthermore, it accelerated the iterative process of reference model design and validation by an average of 5.90x compared to traditional approaches. These results highlight the potential of ChatModel to significantly advance the automation of reference model generation and validation.</p></details> |  |

This advancement also raises ethical and legal concerns, such as academic dishonesty or the generation of malicious code. For accountability, it is imperative to detect whether a piece of code is AI-generated. Watermarking is broadly considered a promising solution and has been successfully applied to identify LLM-generated text. However, existing efforts on code are far from ideal, suffering from limited universality and excessive time and memory consumption. In this work, we propose a plug-and-play watermarking approach for AI-generated code detection, named ACW (AI Code Watermarking). ACW is training-free and works by selectively applying a set of carefully-designed, semantic-preserving and idempotent code transformations to LLM code outputs. The presence or absence of the transformations serves as implicit watermarks, enabling the detection of AI-generated code. Our experimental results show that ACW effectively detects AI-generated code, preserves code utility, and is resilient against code optimizations. Especially, ACW is efficient and is universal across different LLMs, addressing the limitations of existing approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

These changes are widely attributed to the growing influence of Large Language Models (LLMs), which frequently rely on a distinct lexical style. Divergences between model output and target audience norms can be viewed as a form of misalignment. While these shifts are often linked to using Artificial Intelligence (AI) directly as a tool to generate text, it remains unclear whether the changes reflect broader changes in the human language system itself. To explore this question, we constructed a dataset of 22.1 million words from unscripted spoken language drawn from conversational science and technology podcasts. We analyzed lexical trends before and after ChatGPT's release in 2022, focusing on commonly LLM-associated words. Our results show a moderate yet significant increase in the usage of these words post-2022, suggesting a convergence between human word choices and LLM-associated patterns. In contrast, baseline synonym words exhibit no significant directional shift. Given the short time frame and the number of words affected, this may indicate the onset of a remarkable shift in language use. Whether this represents natural language change or a novel shift driven by AI exposure remains an open question. Similarly, although the shifts may stem from broader adoption patterns, it may also be that upstream training misalignments ultimately contribute to changes in human language use. These findings parallel ethical concerns that misaligned models may shape social and moral beliefs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AIES 2025.

However, cloud-based LLM services often suffer from high latency, unstable responsiveness, and privacy concerns. Therefore, multiple LLMs are usually deployed at the network edge to boost real-time responsiveness and protect data privacy, particularly for many emerging smart mobile and IoT applications. Given the varying response quality and latency of LLM services, a critical issue is how to route user requests from mobile and IoT devices to an appropriate LLM service (i.e., edge LLM expert) to ensure acceptable quality-of-service (QoS). Existing routing algorithms fail to simultaneously address the heterogeneity of LLM services, the interference among requests, and the dynamic workloads necessary for maintaining long-term stable QoS. To meet these challenges, in this paper we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based QoS-aware LLM routing framework for sustained high-quality LLM services. Due to the dynamic nature of the global state, we propose a dynamic state abstraction technique to compactly represent global state features with a heterogeneous graph attention network (HAN). Additionally, we introduce an action impact estimator and a tailored reward function to guide the DRL agent in maximizing QoS and preventing latency violations. Extensive experiments on both Poisson and real-world workloads demonstrate that our proposed algorithm significantly improves average QoS and computing resource efficiency compared to existing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing</p></details> |

Amongst PEFT methods, low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has achieved notable success. However, recent studies have highlighted its limitations compared against full-rank alternatives, particularly when applied to multimodal and large language models. In this work, we present a quantitative comparison amongst full-rank and low-rank PEFT methods using a synthetic matrix approximation benchmark with controlled spectral properties. Our results confirm that LoRA struggles to approximate matrices with relatively flat spectrums or high frequency components -- signs of high effective ranks. To this end, we introduce KRAdapter, a novel PEFT algorithm that leverages the Khatri-Rao product to produce weight updates, which, by construction, tends to produce matrix product with a high effective rank. We demonstrate performance gains with KRAdapter on vision-language models up to 1B parameters and on large language models up to 8B parameters, particularly on unseen common-sense reasoning tasks. In addition, KRAdapter maintains the memory and compute efficiency of LoRA, making it a practical and robust alternative to fine-tune billion-scale parameter models.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Large language models (LLMs) show potential in enabling this paradigm. In this context, software documentation acts as an NL specification for functionality. This work introduces NoCode-bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on real-world NL-driven feature addition tasks, consisting of 634 tasks across 10 projects and 114k code changes. Each task pairs documentation updates with corresponding code implementations, validated by developer-written test cases. A subset of 114 high-quality, human-verified instances, NoCode-bench Verified, ensures reliable evaluation. Our experiments reveal that, despite high token usage, the best LLMs achieve a task success rate of only 15.79%, highlighting challenges in cross-file editing, codebase understanding, and tool calling. These findings indicate that LLMs are not yet ready for fully NL-driven no-code development. NoCode-bench lays the foundation for future advances in this area.</p></details> |  |

We introduce policy maps, an approach to AI policy design inspired by the practice of physical mapmaking. Instead of aiming for full coverage, policy maps aid effective navigation through intentional design choices about which aspects to capture and which to abstract away. With Policy Projector, an interactive tool for designing LLM policy maps, an AI practitioner can survey the landscape of model input-output pairs, define custom regions (e.g., "violence"), and navigate these regions with if-then policy rules that can act on LLM outputs (e.g., if output contains "violence" and "graphic details," then rewrite without "graphic details"). Policy Projector supports interactive policy authoring using LLM classification and steering and a map visualization reflecting the AI practitioner's work. In an evaluation with 12 AI safety experts, our system helps policy designers craft policies around problematic model behaviors such as incorrect gender assumptions and handling of immediate physical safety threats.</p></details> | UIST 2025 |

However, it struggles to break through the inherent capability boundaries of the base LLM, due to its inherently on-policy strategy with LLM's immense action space and sparse reward. Further, RLVR can lead to the capability boundary collapse, narrowing the LLM's problem-solving scope. To address this problem, we propose RL-PLUS, a novel approach that synergizes internal exploitation (i.e., Thinking) with external data (i.e., Learning) to achieve stronger reasoning capabilities and surpass the boundaries of base models. RL-PLUS integrates two core components: Multiple Importance Sampling to address for distributional mismatch from external data, and an Exploration-Based Advantage Function to guide the model towards high-value, unexplored reasoning paths. We provide both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of our approach. The results show that RL-PLUS achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with existing RLVR methods on six math reasoning benchmarks and exhibits superior performance on six out-of-distribution reasoning tasks. It also achieves consistent and significant gains across diverse model families, with average relative improvements ranging from 21.1\% to 69.2\%. Moreover, Pass@k curves across multiple benchmarks indicate that RL-PLUS effectively resolves the capability boundary collapse problem.</p></details> |  |

Tangible results from their application suggest that Wavelet transforms can be applied to NLP capturing a variety of linguistic and semantic properties. In this paper, we empirically leverage the application of Discrete Wavelet Transforms (DWT) to word and sentence embeddings. We aim to showcase the capabilities of DWT in analyzing embedding representations at different levels of resolution and compressing them while maintaining their overall quality. We assess the effectiveness of DWT embeddings on semantic similarity tasks to show how DWT can be used to consolidate important semantic information in an embedding vector. We show the efficacy of the proposed paradigm using different embedding models, including large language models, on downstream tasks. Our results show that DWT can reduce the dimensionality of embeddings by 50-93% with almost no change in performance for semantic similarity tasks, while achieving superior accuracy in most downstream tasks. Our findings pave the way for applying DWT to improve NLP applications.</p></details> |  |

Unlike linear text inputs, tables are two-dimensional, encompassing formats that range from well-structured database tables to complex, multi-layered spreadsheets, each with different purposes. This diversity in format and purpose has led to the development of specialized methods and tasks, instead of universal approaches, making navigation of table understanding tasks challenging. To address these challenges, this paper introduces key concepts through a taxonomy of tabular input representations and an introduction of table understanding tasks. We highlight several critical gaps in the field that indicate the need for further research: (1) the predominance of retrieval-focused tasks that require minimal reasoning beyond mathematical and logical operations; (2) significant challenges faced by models when processing complex table structures, large-scale tables, length context, or multi-table scenarios; and (3) the limited generalization of models across different tabular representations and formats.</p></details> |  |

A key capability is the integration of long-term memory capabilities, enabling these agents to draw upon historical interactions and knowledge. However, the growing memory size and need for semantic structuring pose significant challenges. In this work, we propose an autonomous memory augmentation approach, MemInsight, to enhance semantic data representation and retrieval mechanisms. By leveraging autonomous augmentation to historical interactions, LLM agents are shown to deliver more accurate and contextualized responses. We empirically validate the efficacy of our proposed approach in three task scenarios; conversational recommendation, question answering and event summarization. On the LLM-REDIAL dataset, MemInsight boosts persuasiveness of recommendations by up to 14%. Moreover, it outperforms a RAG baseline by 34% in recall for LoCoMo retrieval. Our empirical results show the potential of MemInsight to enhance the contextual performance of LLM agents across multiple tasks.</p></details> |  |

While previous approaches in the Indian context have relied on internal case content such as facts, issues, and reasoning, they often overlook a core element of common law systems, which is reliance on statutory provisions and judicial precedents. In this work, we propose NyayaRAG, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that simulates realistic courtroom scenarios by providing models with factual case descriptions, relevant legal statutes, and semantically retrieved prior cases. NyayaRAG evaluates the effectiveness of these combined inputs in predicting court decisions and generating legal explanations using a domain-specific pipeline tailored to the Indian legal system. We assess performance across various input configurations using both standard lexical and semantic metrics as well as LLM-based evaluators such as G-Eval. Our results show that augmenting factual inputs with structured legal knowledge significantly improves both predictive accuracy and explanation quality.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods have aimed to enhance models' search and reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL). Although these methods demonstrate promising results, they face challenges in training stability and encounter issues such as substantial inference time and restricted capabilities due to reliance on single-query mode. In this paper, we propose RAG-R1, a novel training framework designed to enable LLMs to adaptively leverage internal and external knowledge during the reasoning process. We further expand the generation and retrieval processes within the framework from single-query mode to multi-query parallelism, with the aim of reducing inference time and enhancing the model's capabilities. Extensive experiments on seven question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the strongest baseline by up to 13.2% and decreases inference time by 11.1%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Credible Plan-Driven RAG Method for Multi-Hop Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16787v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-hop question answering (QA) presents significant challenges for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), particularly in decomposing complex queries into reliable reasoning paths and managing error propagation. Existing RAG methods often suffer from deviations in reasoning paths and cumulative errors in intermediate steps, reducing the fidelity of the final answer. To address these limitations, we propose PAR-RAG (Plan-then-Act-and-Review RAG), a novel framework inspired by the PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) cycle, to enhance both the accuracy and factual consistency in multi-hop question answering. Specifically, PAR-RAG selects exemplars matched by the semantic complexity of the current question to guide complexity-aware top-down planning, resulting in more precise and coherent multi-step reasoning trajectories. This design mitigates reasoning drift and reduces the risk of suboptimal path convergence, a common issue in existing RAG approaches. Furthermore, a dual-verification mechanism evaluates and corrects intermediate errors, ensuring that the reasoning process remains factually grounded. Experimental results on various QA benchmarks demonstrate that PAR-RAG outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness in both performance and reasoning robustness.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |
| **[DrugMCTS: a drug repurposing framework combining multi-agent, RAG and Monte Carlo Tree Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07426v3)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated considerable potential in scientific domains such as drug repositioning. However, their effectiveness remains constrained when reasoning extends beyond the knowledge acquired during pretraining. Conventional approaches, such as fine-tuning or retrieval-augmented generation, face limitations in either imposing high computational overhead or failing to fully exploit structured scientific data. To overcome these challenges, we propose DrugMCTS, a novel framework that synergistically integrates RAG, multi-agent collaboration, and Monte Carlo Tree Search for drug repositioning. The framework employs five specialized agents tasked with retrieving and analyzing molecular and protein information, thereby enabling structured and iterative reasoning. Extensive experiments on the DrugBank and KIBA datasets demonstrate that DrugMCTS achieves substantially higher recall and robustness compared to both general-purpose LLMs and deep learning baselines. Our results highlight the importance of structured reasoning, agent-based collaboration, and feedback-driven search mechanisms in advancing LLM applications for drug repositioning.</p></details> |  |
| **[KeyKnowledgeRAG (K^2RAG): An Enhanced RAG method for improved LLM question-answering capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07695v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning is an immensely resource-intensive process when retraining Large Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate a larger body of knowledge. Although many fine-tuning techniques have been developed to reduce the time and computational cost involved, the challenge persists as LLMs continue to grow in size and complexity. To address this, a new approach to knowledge expansion in LLMs is needed. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers one such alternative by storing external knowledge in a database and retrieving relevant chunks to support question answering. However, naive implementations of RAG face significant limitations in scalability and answer accuracy. This paper introduces KeyKnowledgeRAG (K2RAG), a novel framework designed to overcome these limitations. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer paradigm, K2RAG integrates dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text summarization to improve retrieval quality and system efficiency. The framework also includes a preprocessing step that summarizes the training data, significantly reducing the training time. K2RAG was evaluated using the MultiHopRAG dataset, where the proposed pipeline was trained on the document corpus and tested on a separate evaluation set. Results demonstrated notable improvements over common naive RAG implementations. K2RAG achieved the highest mean answer similarity score of 0.57, and reached the highest third quartile (Q3) similarity of 0.82, indicating better alignment with ground-truth answers. In addition to improved accuracy, the framework proved highly efficient. The summarization step reduced the average training time of individual components by 93%, and execution speed was up to 40% faster than traditional knowledge graph-based RAG systems. K2RAG also demonstrated superior scalability, requiring three times less VRAM than several naive RAG implementations tested in this study.</p></details> | 21 pages, 14 figures |

Currently, text visualizations are confined either to _flat, line-based_ decorations, which can convey only limited information about textual structure, or _nested boxes_, which convey structure but often destroy the typographic layout of the underlying text. We hypothesize that the lack of rich styling options limits the kinds of information that are displayed alongside text, wherever it may be displayed. In this paper, we show that it is possible to achieve arbitrarily nested decorations while minimally disturbing the underlying typographic layout. Specifically, we present a layout algorithm that generates _ragged blocks_, or _rocks_, which are rectilinear polygons that allow nested text to be compactly rendered even when styled with borders and padding. Our layout algorithm is evaluated on a benchmark suite comprising representative source code files in multiple programming languages. The (ragged block) layouts produced by our algorithm are substantially more compact than the (rectangular block) layouts produced by conventional techniques, when uniformly styling every element in the syntax tree with borders and padding.</p></details> | <details><summary>UIST ...</summary><p>UIST 2025 Paper + Appendices</p></details> |

Existing fusion approaches typically rely on either instance-based proposals or dense BEV grids, which either lack holistic scene understanding or are limited by rigid grid structures. To address these, we propose RaGS, the first framework to leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) as representation for fusing 4D radar and monocular cues in 3D object detection. 3D GS naturally suits 3D object detection by modeling the scene as a field of Gaussians, dynamically allocating resources on foreground objects and providing a flexible, resource-efficient solution. RaGS uses a cascaded pipeline to construct and refine the Gaussian field. It starts with the Frustum-based Localization Initiation (FLI), which unprojects foreground pixels to initialize coarse 3D Gaussians positions. Then, the Iterative Multimodal Aggregation (IMA) fuses semantics and geometry, refining the limited Gaussians to the regions of interest. Finally, the Multi-level Gaussian Fusion (MGF) renders the Gaussians into multi-level BEV features for 3D object detection. By dynamically focusing on sparse objects within scenes, RaGS enable object concentrating while offering comprehensive scene perception. Extensive experiments on View-of-Delft, TJ4DRadSet, and OmniHD-Scenes benchmarks demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance. Code will be released.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, conference</p></details> |
| **[Culinary Crossroads: A RAG Framework for Enhancing Diversity in Cross-Cultural Recipe Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21934v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In cross-cultural recipe adaptation, the goal is not only to ensure cultural appropriateness and retain the original dish's essence, but also to provide diverse options for various dietary needs and preferences. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a promising approach, combining the retrieval of real recipes from the target cuisine for cultural adaptability with large language models (LLMs) for relevance. However, it remains unclear whether RAG can generate diverse adaptation results. Our analysis shows that RAG tends to overly rely on a limited portion of the context across generations, failing to produce diverse outputs even when provided with varied contextual inputs. This reveals a key limitation of RAG in creative tasks with multiple valid answers: it fails to leverage contextual diversity for generating varied responses. To address this issue, we propose CARRIAGE, a plug-and-play RAG framework for cross-cultural recipe adaptation that enhances diversity in both retrieval and context organization. To our knowledge, this is the first RAG framework that explicitly aims to generate highly diverse outputs to accommodate multiple user preferences. Our experiments show that CARRIAGE achieves Pareto efficiency in terms of diversity and quality of recipe adaptation compared to closed-book LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[FB-RAG: Improving RAG with Forward and Backward Lookup](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17206v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) struggles with complex queries that lack strong signals to retrieve the most relevant context, forcing a trade-off between choosing a small context that misses key information and a large context that confuses the LLM. To address this, we propose Forward-Backward RAG (FB-RAG), a new training-free framework based on a simple yet powerful forward-looking strategy. FB-RAG employs a light-weight LLM to peek into potential future generations, using evidence from multiple sampled outputs to precisely identify the most relevant context for a final, more powerful generator. This improves performance without complex finetuning or Reinforcement Learning common in prior work. Across 9 datasets, FB-RAG consistently delivers strong results. Further, the performance gains can be achieved with reduced latency due to a shorter, more focused prompt for the powerful generator. On EN.QA dataset, FB-RAG matches the leading baseline with over 48% latency reduction or achieves an 8% performance improvement with a 10% latency reduction. Our analysis finds cases where even when the forward-looking LLM fails to generate correct answers, its attempts are sufficient to guide the final model to an accurate response, demonstrating how smaller LLMs can systematically improve the performance and efficiency of larger ones.</p></details> |  |

The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, combining language models (LLMs) with search engines, is particularly notable for its ability to generate responses from document corpora. Despite its potential, the reliability of RAG systems in critical contexts remains a concern, with issues such as hallucinations persisting. This study evaluates a RAG system used in due diligence for an investment fund. We propose a robust evaluation protocol combining human annotations and LLM-Judge annotations to identify system failures, like hallucinations, off-topic, failed citations, and abstentions. Inspired by the Prediction Powered Inference (PPI) method, we achieve precise performance measurements with statistical guarantees. We provide a comprehensive dataset for further analysis. Our contributions aim to enhance the reliability and scalability of RAG systems evaluation protocols in industrial applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>in Fr...</summary><p>in French language.

| **[Validating Pharmacogenomics Generative Artificial Intelligence Query Prompts Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21453v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study evaluated Sherpa Rx, an artificial intelligence tool leveraging large language models and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for pharmacogenomics, to validate its performance on key response metrics. Sherpa Rx integrated Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines with Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB) data to generate contextually relevant responses. A dataset (N=260 queries) spanning 26 CPIC guidelines was used to evaluate drug-gene interactions, dosing recommendations, and therapeutic implications. In Phase 1, only CPIC data was embedded. Phase 2 additionally incorporated PharmGKB content. Responses were scored on accuracy, relevance, clarity, completeness (5-point Likert scale), and recall. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests compared accuracy between Phase 1 and Phase 2, and between Phase 2 and ChatGPT-4omini. A 20-question quiz assessed the tool's real-world applicability against other models. In Phase 1 (N=260), Sherpa Rx demonstrated high performance of accuracy 4.9, relevance 5.0, clarity 5.0, completeness 4.8, and recall 0.99. The subset analysis (N=20) showed improvements in accuracy (4.6 vs. 4.4, Phase 2 vs. Phase 1 subset) and completeness (5.0 vs. 4.8). ChatGPT-4omini performed comparably in relevance (5.0) and clarity (4.9) but lagged in accuracy (3.9) and completeness (4.2). Differences in accuracy between Phase 1 and Phase 2 was not statistically significant. However, Phase 2 significantly outperformed ChatGPT-4omini. On the 20-question quiz, Sherpa Rx achieved 90% accuracy, outperforming other models. Integrating additional resources like CPIC and PharmGKB with RAG enhances AI accuracy and performance. This study highlights the transformative potential of generative AI like Sherpa Rx in pharmacogenomics, improving decision-making with accurate, personalized responses.</p></details> |  |

We replicate an existing, challenging real-world annotation task with complex multi-part criteria on a set of thousands of pages of public disclosure documents from global systemically important banks (GSIBs) with heterogeneous and incomplete information content. We test two treatment conditions. First, a "naive" AI use condition in which annotators use only the tool and must accept the first answer they are given. And second, an "interactive" AI treatment condition where annotators use the tool interactively, and use their judgement to follow-up with additional information if necessary. Compared to the human-only baseline, the use of the AI tool accelerated task execution by up to a factor of 10 and enhanced task accuracy, particularly in the interactive condition. We find that when extrapolated to the full task, these methods could save up to 268 hours compared to the human-only approach. Additionally, our findings suggest that annotator skill, not just with the subject matter domain, but also with AI tools, is a factor in both the accuracy and speed of task performance.</p></details> |  |

The challenge aims to address a critical limitation of modern Vision Language Models (VLMs): their propensity to hallucinate, especially when faced with egocentric imagery, long-tail entities, and complex, multi-hop questions. This issue is particularly problematic in real-world applications where users pose fact-seeking queries that demand high factual accuracy across diverse modalities. To tackle this, we propose a robust, multi-stage framework that prioritizes factual accuracy and truthfulness over completeness. Our solution integrates a lightweight query router for efficiency, a query-aware retrieval and summarization pipeline, a dual-pathways generation and a post-hoc verification. This conservative strategy is designed to minimize hallucinations, which incur a severe penalty in the competition's scoring metric. Our approach achieved 3rd place in Task 1, demonstrating the effectiveness of prioritizing answer reliability in complex multi-modal RAG systems.

However, these systems are vulnerable to adversarial poisoning attacks, where malicious passages injected into the retrieval corpus can mislead models into producing factually incorrect outputs. In this paper, we present a rigorously controlled empirical study of how RAG systems behave under such attacks and how their robustness can be improved. On the generation side, we introduce a structured taxonomy of context types-adversarial, untouched, and guiding-and systematically analyze their individual and combined effects on model outputs. On the retrieval side, we evaluate several retrievers to measure how easily they expose LLMs to adversarial contexts. Our findings also reveal that "skeptical prompting" can activate LLMs' internal reasoning, enabling partial self-defense against adversarial passages, though its effectiveness depends strongly on the model's reasoning capacity. Together, our experiments (code available at https://github.com/JinyanSu1/eval_PoisonRaG) and analysis provide actionable insights for designing safer and more resilient RAG systems, paving the way for more reliable real-world deployments.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a comprehensive systematic review of RAG, tracing its evolution from early developments in open domain question answering to recent state-of-the-art implementations across diverse applications. The review begins by outlining the motivations behind RAG, particularly its ability to mitigate hallucinations and outdated knowledge in parametric models. Core technical components-retrieval mechanisms, sequence-to-sequence generation models, and fusion strategies are examined in detail. A year-by-year analysis highlights key milestones and research trends, providing insight into RAG's rapid growth. The paper further explores the deployment of RAG in enterprise systems, addressing practical challenges related to retrieval of proprietary data, security, and scalability. A comparative evaluation of RAG implementations is conducted, benchmarking performance on retrieval accuracy, generation fluency, latency, and computational efficiency. Persistent challenges such as retrieval quality, privacy concerns, and integration overhead are critically assessed. Finally, the review highlights emerging solutions, including hybrid retrieval approaches, privacy-preserving techniques, optimized fusion strategies, and agentic RAG architectures. These innovations point toward a future of more reliable, efficient, and context-aware knowledge-intensive NLP systems.</p></details> | 33 pages, 2 figures |

While context compression mitigates this issue, existing methods apply fixed compression rates, over-compressing simple queries or under-compressing complex ones. We propose Adaptive Context Compression for RAG (ACC-RAG), a framework that dynamically adjusts compression rates based on input complexity, optimizing inference efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. ACC-RAG combines a hierarchical compressor (for multi-granular embeddings) with a context selector to retain minimal sufficient information, akin to human skimming. Evaluated on Wikipedia and five QA datasets, ACC-RAG outperforms fixed-rate methods and matches/unlocks over 4 times faster inference versus standard RAG while maintaining or improving accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, this reliance on external sources exposes a security risk, attackers can inject poisoned documents into the knowledge base to steer the generation process toward harmful or misleading outputs. In this paper, we propose Gradient-based Masked Token Probability (GMTP), a novel defense method to detect and filter out adversarially crafted documents. Specifically, GMTP identifies high-impact tokens by examining gradients of the retriever's similarity function. These key tokens are then masked, and their probabilities are checked via a Masked Language Model (MLM). Since injected tokens typically exhibit markedly low masked-token probabilities, this enables GMTP to easily detect malicious documents and achieve high-precision filtering. Experiments demonstrate that GMTP is able to eliminate over 90% of poisoned content while retaining relevant documents, thus maintaining robust retrieval and generation performance across diverse datasets and adversarial settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, accepted to ACL Findings 2025</p></details> |

However, due to heterogeneous training data and model architecture, the variant embedding models used in RAG exhibit different benefits across various areas, often leading to different similarity calculation results and, consequently, varying response quality from LLMs. To address this problem, we propose and examine two approaches to enhance RAG by combining the benefits of multiple embedding models, named Mixture-Embedding RAG and Confident RAG. Mixture-Embedding RAG simply sorts and selects retrievals from multiple embedding models based on standardized similarity; however, it does not outperform vanilla RAG. In contrast, Confident RAG generates responses multiple times using different embedding models and then selects the responses with the highest confidence level, demonstrating average improvements of approximately 10% and 5% over vanilla LLMs and RAG, respectively. The consistent results across different LLMs and embedding models indicate that Confident RAG is an efficient plug-and-play approach for various domains. We will release our code upon publication.</p></details> |  |

Cloud-based traffic simulation solutions have flourished, offering increasingly realistic representations of the evolving mobility landscape. LLMs have emerged as pioneering tools, providing robust support for various applications, including intelligent decision-making, user interaction, and real-time traffic analysis. As user demand for e-mobility continues to grow, delivering comprehensive end-to-end solutions has become crucial. In this paper, we present a cloud-based, LLM-powered shared e-mobility platform, integrated with a mobile application for personalized route recommendations. The optimization module is evaluated based on travel time and cost across different traffic scenarios. Additionally, the LLM-powered RAG framework is evaluated at the schema level for different users, using various evaluation methods. Schema-level RAG with XiYanSQL achieves an average execution accuracy of 0.81 on system operator queries and 0.98 on user queries.</p></details> |  |

This is a critical gap in knowledge-intensive domains. We introduce INRAExplorer, an agentic RAG system for exploring the scientific data of INRAE (France's National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment). INRAExplorer employs an LLM-based agent with a multi-tool architecture to dynamically engage a rich knowledge base, through a comprehensive knowledge graph derived from open access INRAE publications. This design empowers INRAExplorer to conduct iterative, targeted queries, retrieve exhaustive datasets (e.g., all publications by an author), perform multi-hop reasoning, and deliver structured, comprehensive answers. INRAExplorer serves as a concrete illustration of enhancing knowledge interaction in specialized fields.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECAI ...</summary><p>ECAI 2025 demo track, 4 pages</p></details> |
| **[KnowShiftQA: How Robust are RAG Systems when Textbook Knowledge Shifts in K-12 Education?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08985v4)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems show remarkable potential as question answering tools in the K-12 Education domain, where knowledge is typically queried within the restricted scope of authoritative textbooks. However, discrepancies between these textbooks and the parametric knowledge inherent in Large Language Models (LLMs) can undermine the effectiveness of RAG systems. To systematically investigate RAG system robustness against such knowledge discrepancies, we introduce KnowShiftQA. This novel question answering dataset simulates these discrepancies by applying deliberate hypothetical knowledge updates to both answers and source documents, reflecting how textbook knowledge can shift. KnowShiftQA comprises 3,005 questions across five subjects, designed with a comprehensive question typology focusing on context utilization and knowledge integration. Our extensive experiments on retrieval and question answering performance reveal that most RAG systems suffer a substantial performance drop when faced with these knowledge discrepancies. Furthermore, questions requiring the integration of contextual (textbook) knowledge with parametric (LLM) knowledge pose a significant challenge to current LLMs.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Main |
| **[Reading Between the Timelines: RAG for Answering Diachronic Questions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22917v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) excels at injecting static, factual knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs), it exhibits a critical deficit in handling longitudinal queries that require tracking entities and phenomena across time. This blind spot arises because conventional, semantically-driven retrieval methods are not equipped to gather evidence that is both topically relevant and temporally coherent for a specified duration. We address this challenge by proposing a new framework that fundamentally redesigns the RAG pipeline to infuse temporal logic. Our methodology begins by disentangling a user's query into its core subject and its temporal window. It then employs a specialized retriever that calibrates semantic matching against temporal relevance, ensuring the collection of a contiguous evidence set that spans the entire queried period. To enable rigorous evaluation of this capability, we also introduce the Analytical Diachronic Question Answering Benchmark (ADQAB), a challenging evaluation suite grounded in a hybrid corpus of real and synthetic financial news. Empirical results on ADQAB show that our approach yields substantial gains in answer accuracy, surpassing standard RAG implementations by 13% to 27%. This work provides a validated pathway toward RAG systems capable of performing the nuanced, evolutionary analysis required for complex, real-world questions. The dataset and code for this study are publicly available at https://github.com/kwunhang/TA-RAG.</p></details> |  |

Yet, a pressing challenge remains: How can we trust these agents especially in zero-shot settings with no fine-tuning? We introduce a novel modular Agentic AI visual classification framework that integrates generalist multimodal agents with a non-visual reasoning orchestrator and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module. Applied to apple leaf disease diagnosis, we benchmark three configurations: (I) zero-shot with confidence-based orchestration, (II) fine-tuned agents with improved performance, and (III) trust-calibrated orchestration enhanced by CLIP-based image retrieval and re-evaluation loops. Using confidence calibration metrics (ECE, OCR, CCC), the orchestrator modulates trust across agents. Our results demonstrate a 77.94\% accuracy improvement in the zero-shot setting using trust-aware orchestration and RAG, achieving 85.63\% overall. GPT-4o showed better calibration, while Qwen-2.5-VL displayed overconfidence. Furthermore, image-RAG grounded predictions with visually similar cases, enabling correction of agent overconfidence via iterative re-evaluation. The proposed system separates perception (vision agents) from meta-reasoning (orchestrator), enabling scalable and interpretable multi-agent AI. This blueprint is extensible to diagnostics, biology, and other trust-critical domains. All models, prompts, results, and system components including the complete software source code are openly released to support reproducibility, transparency, and community benchmarking at Github: https://github.com/Applied-AI-Research-Lab/Orchestrator-Agent-Trust</p></details> |  |
| **[RAG-based Architectures for Drug Side Effect Retrieval in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13822v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drug side effects are a major global health concern, necessitating advanced methods for their accurate detection and analysis. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising conversational interfaces, their inherent limitations, including reliance on black-box training data, susceptibility to hallucinations, and lack of domain-specific knowledge, hinder their reliability in specialized fields like pharmacovigilance. To address this gap, we propose two architectures: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG, which integrate comprehensive drug side effect knowledge into a Llama 3 8B language model. Through extensive evaluations on 19,520 drug side effect associations (covering 976 drugs and 3,851 side effect terms), our results demonstrate that GraphRAG achieves near-perfect accuracy in drug side effect retrieval. This framework offers a highly accurate and scalable solution, signifying a significant advancement in leveraging LLMs for critical pharmacovigilance applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[ASTRID -- An Automated and Scalable TRIaD for the Evaluation of RAG-based Clinical Question Answering Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08208v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive potential in clinical question answering (QA), with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) emerging as a leading approach for ensuring the factual accuracy of model responses. However, current automated RAG metrics perform poorly in clinical and conversational use cases. Using clinical human evaluations of responses is expensive, unscalable, and not conducive to the continuous iterative development of RAG systems. To address these challenges, we introduce ASTRID - an Automated and Scalable TRIaD for evaluating clinical QA systems leveraging RAG - consisting of three metrics: Context Relevance (CR), Refusal Accuracy (RA), and Conversational Faithfulness (CF). Our novel evaluation metric, CF, is designed to better capture the faithfulness of a model's response to the knowledge base without penalising conversational elements. To validate our triad, we curate a dataset of over 200 real-world patient questions posed to an LLM-based QA agent during surgical follow-up for cataract surgery - the highest volume operation in the world - augmented with clinician-selected questions for emergency, clinical, and non-clinical out-of-domain scenarios. We demonstrate that CF can predict human ratings of faithfulness better than existing definitions for conversational use cases. Furthermore, we show that evaluation using our triad consisting of CF, RA, and CR exhibits alignment with clinician assessment for inappropriate, harmful, or unhelpful responses. Finally, using nine different LLMs, we demonstrate that the three metrics can closely agree with human evaluations, highlighting the potential of these metrics for use in LLM-driven automated evaluation pipelines. We also publish the prompts and datasets for these experiments, providing valuable resources for further research and development.</p></details> | 29 pages |
| **[Secure Multifaceted-RAG for Enterprise: Hybrid Knowledge Retrieval with Security Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13425v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems face challenges in enterprise settings due to limited retrieval scope and data security risks. When relevant internal documents are unavailable, the system struggles to generate accurate and complete responses. Additionally, using closed-source Large Language Models (LLMs) raises concerns about exposing proprietary information. To address these issues, we propose the Secure Multifaceted-RAG (SecMulti-RAG) framework, which retrieves not only from internal documents but also from two supplementary sources: pre-generated expert knowledge for anticipated queries and on-demand external LLM-generated knowledge. To mitigate security risks, we adopt a local open-source generator and selectively utilize external LLMs only when prompts are deemed safe by a filtering mechanism. This approach enhances completeness, prevents data leakage, and reduces costs. In our evaluation on a report generation task in the automotive industry, SecMulti-RAG significantly outperforms traditional RAG - achieving 79.3 to 91.9 percent win rates across correctness, richness, and helpfulness in LLM-based evaluation, and 56.3 to 70.4 percent in human evaluation. This highlights SecMulti-RAG as a practical and secure solution for enterprise RAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-task retriever fine-tuning for domain-specific and efficient RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04652v2)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become ubiquitous when deploying Large Language Models (LLMs), as it can address typical limitations such as generating hallucinated or outdated information. However, when building real-world RAG applications, practical issues arise. First, the retrieved information is generally domain-specific. Since it is computationally expensive to fine-tune LLMs, it is more feasible to fine-tune the retriever to improve the quality of the data included in the LLM input. Second, as more applications are deployed in the same real-world system, one cannot afford to deploy separate retrievers. Moreover, these RAG applications normally retrieve different kinds of data. Our solution is to instruction fine-tune a small retriever encoder on a variety of domain-specific tasks to allow us to deploy one encoder that can serve many use cases, thereby achieving low-cost, scalability, and speed. We show how this encoder generalizes to out-of-domain settings as well as to an unseen retrieval task on real-world enterprise use cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures.

This survey synthesizes both strands under a unified reasoning-retrieval perspective. We first map how advanced reasoning optimizes each stage of RAG (Reasoning-Enhanced RAG). Then, we show how retrieved knowledge of different type supply missing premises and expand context for complex inference (RAG-Enhanced Reasoning). Finally, we spotlight emerging Synergized RAG-Reasoning frameworks, where (agentic) LLMs iteratively interleave search and reasoning to achieve state-of-the-art performance across knowledge-intensive benchmarks. We categorize methods, datasets, and open challenges, and outline research avenues toward deeper RAG-Reasoning systems that are more effective, multimodally-adaptive, trustworthy, and human-centric.

Improper retrieval settings can degrade performance, making RAG less reliable than closed-book generation. In this work, we introduce RAGGED, a framework for systematically evaluating RAG systems across diverse retriever-reader configurations, retrieval depths, and datasets. Our analysis reveals that reader robustness to noise is the key determinant of RAG stability and scalability. Some readers benefit from increased retrieval depth, while others degrade due to their sensitivity to distracting content. Through large-scale experiments on open-domain, multi-hop, and specialized-domain datasets, we show that retrievers, rerankers, and prompts influence performance but do not fundamentally alter these reader-driven trends. By providing a principled framework and new metrics to assess RAG stability and scalability, RAGGED enables systematic evaluation of retrieval-augmented generation systems, guiding future research on optimizing retrieval depth and model robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/neulab/ragged</p></details> |

Prior work either reduces the response delay (through better scheduling of RAG queries) or strives to maximize quality (which involves tuning the RAG workflow), but they fall short in optimizing the tradeoff between the delay and quality of RAG responses. This paper presents METIS, the first RAG system that jointly schedules queries and adapts the key RAG configurations of each query, such as the number of retrieved text chunks and synthesis methods, in order to balance quality optimization and response delay reduction. Using 4 popular RAG-QA datasets, we show that compared with the state-of-the-art RAG optimization schemes, METIS reduces the generation latency by $1.64-2.54\times$ without sacrificing generation quality.</p></details> | 17 pages, 18 figures |

While large language models (LLMs) offer potential for automating advisory tasks, most existing solutions remain limited to prototypes or synthetic benchmarks. MARAUS addresses this gap by combining hybrid retrieval, multi-agent orchestration, and LLM-based generation into a system tailored for real-world university admissions. In collaboration with the University of Transport Technology (UTT) in Hanoi, we conducted a two-phase study involving technical development and real-world evaluation. MARAUS processed over 6,000 actual user interactions, spanning six categories of queries. Results show substantial improvements over LLM-only baselines: on average 92 percent accuracy, hallucination rates reduced from 15 precent to 1.45 percent, and average response times below 4 seconds. The system operated cost-effectively, with a two-week deployment cost of 11.58 USD using GPT-4o mini. This work provides actionable insights for the deployment of agentic RAG systems in low-resource educational settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[DRAGON: Dynamic RAG Benchmark On News](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05713v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a widely adopted approach for improving the factuality of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge at inference time. Although there exist multiple RAG benchmarks for English, evaluation resources for other languages, including Russian, remain scarce and static, failing to capture the dynamic nature of real-world deployments. In this work, we present DRAGON (Dynamic RAG Benchmark On News), the first dynamic benchmark for evaluating RAG systems in Russian on a changing news corpora. DRAGON is built upon a regularly updated corpus of Russian news and public documents and supports comprehensive evaluation of both the retriever and generator components. Question generation is performed automatically with the use of Knowledge Graph constructed from the corpus and enables the extraction of four core question types aligned with distinct subgraph patterns. We release a complete evaluation framework comprising the pipeline for automatic question generation, evaluation scripts, which are potentially reusable for other languages and multilingual settings, and benchmark data. We also launch a public leaderboard to encourage community participation and comparison.</p></details> |  |

What Can Predicted Query Performance Tell Us about the Search Behaviour of Agentic RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10411v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a new paradigm where the reasoning model decides when to invoke a retriever (as a "tool") when answering a question. This paradigm, exemplified by recent research works such as Search-R1, enables the model to decide when to search and obtain external information. However, the queries generated by such Agentic RAG models and the role of the retriever in obtaining high-quality answers remain understudied. To this end, this initial study examines the applicability of query performance prediction (QPP) within the recent Agentic RAG models Search-R1 and R1-Searcher. We find that applying effective retrievers can achieve higher answer quality within a shorter reasoning process. Moreover, the QPP estimates of the generated queries, used as an approximation of their retrieval quality, are positively correlated with the quality of the final answer. Ultimately, our work is a step towards adaptive retrieval within Agentic RAG, where QPP is used to inform the model if the retrieved results are likely to be useful.</p></details> |  |

While classical machine learning models leverage structured socio-demographic and behavioral data, they often fail to capture the nuanced emotional and contextual factors embedded in unstructured student interactions. This paper introduces a transformative AI framework that redefines dropout prediction through three synergistic innovations: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for domain-specific sentiment analysis, prompt engineering to decode academic stressors,and cross-modal attention fusion to dynamically align textual, behavioral, and socio-demographic insights. By grounding sentiment analysis in a curated knowledge base of pedagogical content, our RAG-enhanced BERT model interprets student comments with unprecedented contextual relevance, while optimized prompts isolate indicators of academic distress (e.g., "isolation," "workload anxiety"). A cross-modal attention layer then fuses these insights with temporal engagement patterns, creating holistic risk pro-files. Evaluated on a longitudinal dataset of 4 423 students, the framework achieves 89% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.88, outperforming conventional models by 7% and reducing false negatives by 21%. Beyond prediction, the system generates interpretable interventions by retrieving contextually aligned strategies (e.g., mentorship programs for isolated learners).

Our method processes documents in configurable page batches with cross-batch context preservation, enabling accurate handling of tables spanning multiple pages, embedded visual elements, and procedural content. We evaluate our approach on a curated dataset of PDF documents with manually crafted queries, demonstrating improvements in chunk quality and downstream RAG performance.

However, its adoption is hindered by the complexity of policy languages and the risk of misconfigurations. In this work, we present ARPaCCino, an agentic system that combines Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG), and tool-based validation to automate the generation and verification of PaC rules. Given natural language descriptions of the desired policies, ARPaCCino generates formal Rego rules, assesses IaC compliance, and iteratively refines the IaC configurations to ensure conformance. Thanks to its modular agentic architecture and integration with external tools and knowledge bases, ARPaCCino supports policy validation across a wide range of technologies, including niche or emerging IaC frameworks. Experimental evaluation involving a Terraform-based case study demonstrates ARPaCCino's effectiveness in generating syntactically and semantically correct policies, identifying non-compliant infrastructures, and applying corrective modifications, even when using smaller, open-weight LLMs. Our results highlight the potential of agentic RAG architectures to enhance the automation, reliability, and accessibility of PaC workflows.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by incorporating external information, often from graph-structured data. However, existing graph-based RAG methods suffer from poor graph quality due to incomplete extraction and insufficient utilization of query information during retrieval. To overcome these limitations, we propose CUE-RAG, a novel approach that introduces (1) a multi-partite graph index incorporates text Chunks, knowledge Units, and Entities to capture semantic content at multiple levels of granularity, (2) a hybrid extraction strategy that reduces LLM token usage while still producing accurate and disambiguated knowledge units, and (3) Q-Iter, a query-driven iterative retrieval strategy that enhances relevance through semantic search and constrained graph traversal. Experiments on three QA benchmarks show that CUE-RAG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 99.33% higher Accuracy and 113.51% higher F1 score while reducing indexing costs by 72.58%. Remarkably, CUE-RAG matches or outperforms baselines even without using an LLM for indexing. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of CUE-RAG in advancing graph-based RAG systems.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances factual accuracy by integrating external sources, but it presents two key challenges. First, insufficient retrieval can miss critical information, whereas excessive retrieval can introduce irrelevant or misleading content, disrupting model output. Second, even when the model initially provides correct answers, over-reliance on retrieved data can lead to factual errors. To address these issues, we introduce the Multimodal Intelligent Retrieval and Augmentation (MIRA) framework, designed to optimize factual accuracy in MLLM. MIRA consists of two key components: (1) a calibrated Rethinking and Rearrangement module that dynamically adjusts the number of retrieved contexts to manage factual risk, and (2) A medical RAG framework integrating image embeddings and a medical knowledge base with a query-rewrite module for efficient multimodal reasoning. This enables the model to effectively integrate both its inherent knowledge and external references. Our evaluation of publicly available medical VQA and report generation benchmarks demonstrates that MIRA substantially enhances factual accuracy and overall performance, achieving new state-of-the-art results.

| **[SemRAG: Semantic Knowledge-Augmented RAG for Improved Question-Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21110v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces SemRAG, an enhanced Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that efficiently integrates domain-specific knowledge using semantic chunking and knowledge graphs without extensive fine-tuning. Integrating domain-specific knowledge into large language models (LLMs) is crucial for improving their performance in specialized tasks. Yet, existing adaptations are computationally expensive, prone to overfitting and limit scalability. To address these challenges, SemRAG employs a semantic chunking algorithm that segments documents based on the cosine similarity from sentence embeddings, preserving semantic coherence while reducing computational overhead. Additionally, by structuring retrieved information into knowledge graphs, SemRAG captures relationships between entities, improving retrieval accuracy and contextual understanding. Experimental results on MultiHop RAG and Wikipedia datasets demonstrate SemRAG has significantly enhances the relevance and correctness of retrieved information from the Knowledge Graph, outperforming traditional RAG methods. Furthermore, we investigate the optimization of buffer sizes for different data corpus, as optimizing buffer sizes tailored to specific datasets can further improve retrieval performance, as integration of knowledge graphs strengthens entity relationships for better contextual comprehension. The primary advantage of SemRAG is its ability to create an efficient, accurate domain-specific LLM pipeline while avoiding resource-intensive fine-tuning. This makes it a practical and scalable approach aligned with sustainability goals, offering a viable solution for AI applications in domain-specific fields.</p></details> | 16 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Multi-Head RAG: Solving Multi-Aspect Problems with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05085v4)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling the retrieval of documents into the LLM context to provide more accurate and relevant responses. Existing RAG solutions do not focus on queries that may require fetching multiple documents with substantially different contents. Such queries occur frequently, but are challenging because the embeddings of these documents may be distant in the embedding space, making it hard to retrieve them all. This paper introduces Multi-Head RAG (MRAG), a novel scheme designed to address this gap with a simple yet powerful idea: leveraging activations of Transformer's multi-head attention layer, instead of the decoder layer, as keys for fetching multi-aspect documents. The driving observation is that different attention heads learn to capture different data aspects. Harnessing the corresponding activations results in embeddings that represent various facets of data items and queries, improving the retrieval accuracy for complex queries. We provide an evaluation methodology and metrics, multi-aspect datasets, and real-world use cases to demonstrate MRAG's effectiveness. We show MRAG's design advantages over 18 RAG baselines, empirical improvements of up to 20% in retrieval success ratios, and benefits for downstream LLM generation. MRAG can be seamlessly integrated with existing RAG frameworks and benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Cross-Lingual Cost: Retrieval Biases in RAG over Arabic-English Corpora](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07543v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-lingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a critical capability for retrieving and generating answers across languages. Prior work in this context has mostly focused on generation and relied on benchmarks derived from open-domain sources, most notably Wikipedia. In such settings, retrieval challenges often remain hidden due to language imbalances, overlap with pretraining data, and memorized content. To address this gap, we study Arabic-English RAG in a domain-specific setting using benchmarks derived from real-world corporate datasets. Our benchmarks include all combinations of languages for the user query and the supporting document, drawn independently and uniformly at random. This enables a systematic study of multilingual retrieval behavior. Our findings reveal that retrieval is a critical bottleneck in cross-lingual domain-specific scenarios, with significant performance drops occurring when the user query and supporting document languages differ. A key insight is that these failures stem primarily from the retriever's difficulty in ranking documents across languages. Finally, we propose a simple retrieval strategy that addresses this source of failure by enforcing equal retrieval from both languages, resulting in substantial improvements in cross-lingual and overall performance. These results highlight meaningful opportunities for improving multilingual retrieval, particularly in practical, real-world RAG applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAG Safety: Exploring Knowledge Poisoning Attacks to Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08862v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by retrieving external data to mitigate hallucinations and outdated knowledge issues. Benefiting from the strong ability in facilitating diverse data sources and supporting faithful reasoning, knowledge graphs (KGs) have been increasingly adopted in RAG systems, giving rise to KG-based RAG (KG-RAG) methods. Though RAG systems are widely applied in various applications, recent studies have also revealed its vulnerabilities to data poisoning attacks, where malicious information injected into external knowledge sources can mislead the system into producing incorrect or harmful responses. However, these studies focus exclusively on RAG systems using unstructured textual data sources, leaving the security risks of KG-RAG largely unexplored, despite the fact that KGs present unique vulnerabilities due to their structured and editable nature. In this work, we conduct the first systematic investigation of the security issue of KG-RAG methods through data poisoning attacks. To this end, we introduce a practical, stealthy attack setting that aligns with real-world implementation. We propose an attack strategy that first identifies adversarial target answers and then inserts perturbation triples to complete misleading inference chains in the KG, increasing the likelihood that KG-RAG methods retrieve and rely on these perturbations during generation. Through extensive experiments on two benchmarks and four recent KG-RAG methods, our attack strategy demonstrates strong effectiveness in degrading KG-RAG performance, even with minimal KG perturbations. In-depth analyses are also conducted to understand the safety threats within the internal stages of KG-RAG systems and to explore the robustness of LLMs against adversarial knowledge.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

Retrievers encompass a multitude of hyperparameters that significantly impact performance outcomes and demonstrate sensitivity to specific applications. Nevertheless, hyperparameter optimization entails prohibitively high computational expenses. Existing evaluation methods suffer from either prohibitive costs or disconnection from domain-specific scenarios. This paper proposes SEARA (Subset sampling Evaluation for Automatic Retriever Assessment), which addresses evaluation data challenges through subset sampling techniques and achieves robust automated retriever evaluation by minimal retrieval facts extraction and comprehensive retrieval metrics. Based on real user queries, this method enables fully automated retriever evaluation at low cost, thereby obtaining optimal retriever for specific business scenarios. We validate our method across classic RAG applications in rednote, including knowledge-based Q&A system and retrieval-based travel assistant, successfully obtaining scenario-specific optimal retrievers.</p></details> |  |

This work addresses the Closed Visual Question Answering (CVQA) task, where the goal is to select the correct answer to multiple-choice clinical questions based on both user-submitted images and accompanying symptom descriptions. The proposed approach combines three core components: (1) fine-tuning open-source multimodal models from the Qwen, Gemma, and LLaMA families on the competition dataset, (2) introducing a structured reasoning layer that reconciles and adjudicates between candidate model outputs, and (3) incorporating agentic retrieval-augmented generation (agentic RAG), which adds relevant information from the American Academy of Dermatology's symptom and condition database to fill in gaps in patient context. The team achieved second place with a submission that scored sixth, demonstrating competitive performance and high accuracy. Beyond competitive benchmarks, this research addresses a practical challenge in telemedicine: diagnostic decisions must often be made asynchronously, with limited input and with high accuracy and interpretability. By emulating the systematic reasoning patterns employed by dermatologists when evaluating skin conditions, this architecture provided a pathway toward more reliable automated diagnostic support systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 ImageCLEF MEDIQA-MAGIC Challenge</p></details> |

However, RAG's reliance on ingesting external documents introduces new vulnerabilities. This paper exposes a critical security gap at the data loading stage, where malicious actors can stealthily corrupt RAG pipelines by exploiting document ingestion. We propose a taxonomy of 9 knowledge-based poisoning attacks and introduce two novel threat vectors -- Content Obfuscation and Content Injection -- targeting common formats (DOCX, HTML, PDF). Using an automated toolkit implementing 19 stealthy injection techniques, we test five popular data loaders, finding a 74.4% attack success rate across 357 scenarios. We further validate these threats on six end-to-end RAG systems -- including white-box pipelines and black-box services like NotebookLM and OpenAI Assistants -- demonstrating high success rates and critical vulnerabilities that bypass filters and silently compromise output integrity. Our results emphasize the urgent need to secure the document ingestion process in RAG systems against covert content manipulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>curre...</summary><p>currently under submission</p></details> |

In this paper, we explore and assess the feasibility of using traditional binary string features for MFC in the new era of large language models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Specifically, we investigate how Family-Specific String (FSS) features could be utilized in a manner similar to RAG to facilitate MFC. To this end, we develop a curated evaluation framework covering 4,347 samples from 67 malware families, extract and analyze over 25 million strings, and conduct detailed ablation studies to assess the impact of different design choices in four major modules.</p></details> |  |

However, existing retrieval systems predominantly focus on natural text-image matching and lack the capacity to address the diversity and ambiguity inherent in real-world educational scenarios. To address this limitation, we develop a lightweight and efficient multi-modal retrieval module, named Uni-Retrieval, which extracts query-style prototypes and dynamically matches them with tokens from a continually updated Prompt Bank. This Prompt Bank encodes and stores domain-specific knowledge by leveraging a Mixture-of-Expert Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE-LoRA) module and can be adapted to enhance Uni-Retrieval's capability to accommodate unseen query types at test time. To enable natural language educational content generation, we integrate the original Uni-Retrieval with a compact instruction-tuned language model, forming a complete retrieval-augmented generation pipeline named Uni-RAG. Given a style-conditioned query, Uni-RAG first retrieves relevant educational materials and then generates human-readable explanations, feedback, or instructional content aligned with the learning objective. Experimental results on SER and other multi-modal benchmarks show that Uni-RAG outperforms baseline retrieval and RAG systems in both retrieval accuracy and generation quality, while maintaining low computational cost. Our framework provides a scalable, pedagogically grounded solution for intelligent educational systems, bridging retrieval and generation to support personalized, explainable, and efficient learning assistance across diverse STEM scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Fair RAG: On the Impact of Fair Ranking in Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11598v4)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the central role of retrieval in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, much of the existing research on RAG overlooks the well-established field of fair ranking and fails to account for the interests of all stakeholders involved. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic evaluation of RAG systems that integrate fairness-aware rankings, addressing both ranking fairness and attribution fairness, which ensures equitable exposure of the sources cited in the generated content. Our evaluation focuses on measuring item-side fairness, specifically the fair exposure of relevant items retrieved by RAG systems, and investigates how this fairness impacts both the effectiveness of the systems and the attribution of sources in the generated output that users ultimately see. By experimenting with twelve RAG models across seven distinct tasks, we show that incorporating fairness-aware retrieval often maintains or even enhances both ranking quality and generation quality, countering the common belief that fairness compromises system performance. Additionally, we demonstrate that fair retrieval practices lead to more balanced attribution in the final responses, ensuring that the generator fairly cites the sources it relies on. Our findings underscore the importance of item-side fairness in retrieval and generation, laying the foundation for responsible and equitable RAG systems and guiding future research in fair ranking and attribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICTIR...</summary><p>ICTIR 2025 (Oral); NeurIPS 2024 AFME Workshop (Spotlight)</p></details> |

Within the ORAN architecture, Large Language Models (LLMs) can be specialized to generate xApps and rApps by leveraging specifications and API definitions from the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) platform. However, fine-tuning base LLMs for telecom-specific tasks remains expensive and resource-intensive. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a practical alternative through in-context learning, enabling domain adaptation without full retraining. While traditional RAG systems rely on vector-based retrieval, emerging variants such as GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG incorporate knowledge graphs or dual retrieval strategies to support multi-hop reasoning and improve factual grounding. Despite their promise, these methods lack systematic, metric-driven evaluations, particularly in high-stakes domains such as ORAN. In this study, we conduct a comparative evaluation of Vector RAG, GraphRAG, and Hybrid GraphRAG using ORAN specifications. We assess performance across varying question complexities using established generation metrics: faithfulness, answer relevance, context relevance, and factual correctness. Results show that both GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG outperform traditional RAG. Hybrid GraphRAG improves factual correctness by 8%, while GraphRAG improves context relevance by 7%.</p></details> |  |

National protocols and WHO recommendations are typically extensive and complex, making it difficult to extract precise information, especially during urgent situations. This project tackles that issue by developing a multilingual, intelligent question-answering system that transforms static vaccination guidelines into an interactive and user-friendly knowledge base. Built on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework and enhanced with agent-based reasoning (Agentic RAG), the system provides accurate, context-sensitive answers to complex medical queries. Evaluation shows that Agentic RAG outperforms traditional methods, particularly in addressing multi-step or ambiguous questions. To support clinical use, the system is integrated into a mobile application designed for real-time, point-of-care access to essential vaccine information.

| **[Efficient Knowledge Graph Construction and Retrieval from Unstructured Text for Large-Scale RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03226v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a scalable and cost-efficient framework for deploying Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) in enterprise environments. While GraphRAG has shown promise for multi-hop reasoning and structured retrieval, its adoption has been limited by the high computational cost of constructing knowledge graphs using large language models (LLMs) and the latency of graph-based retrieval. To address these challenges, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a dependency-based knowledge graph construction pipeline that leverages industrial-grade NLP libraries to extract entities and relations from unstructured text completely eliminating reliance on LLMs; and (2) a lightweight graph retrieval strategy that combines hybrid query node identification with efficient one-hop traversal for high-recall, low-latency subgraph extraction. We evaluate our framework on two SAP datasets focused on legacy code migration and demonstrate strong empirical performance. Our system achieves up to 15% and 4.35% improvements over traditional RAG baselines based on LLM-as-Judge and RAGAS metrics, respectively. Moreover, our dependency-based construction approach attains 94% of the performance of LLM-generated knowledge graphs (61.87% vs. 65.83%) while significantly reducing cost and improving scalability. These results validate the feasibility of deploying GraphRAG systems in real-world, large-scale enterprise applications without incurring prohibitive resource requirements paving the way for practical, explainable, and domain-adaptable retrieval-augmented reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[CyberRAG: An agentic RAG cyber attack classification and reporting tool](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02424v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) in large enterprises can generate hundreds of thousands of alerts per hour, overwhelming security analysts with logs that demand deep, rapidly evolving domain expertise. Conventional machine-learning detectors trim the alert volume but still yield high false-positive rates, while standard single-pass Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines often retrieve irrelevant context and fail to justify their predictions. To overcome these shortcomings, we present CyberRAG, a modular, agent-based RAG framework that delivers real-time classification, explanation, and structured reporting for cyber-attacks. A central LLM agent orchestrates (i) a pool of fine-tuned specialized classifiers, each tailored to a distinct attack family; (ii) tool adapters for enrichment and alerting; and (iii) an iterative retrieval-and-reason loop that continuously queries a domain-specific knowledge base until the evidence is both relevant and self-consistent. Unlike traditional RAG systems, CyberRAG embraces an agentic design that enables dynamic control flow and adaptive reasoning. This agent-centric architecture refines its threat labels and natural-language justifications autonomously, reducing false positives and enhancing interpretability. The framework is fully extensible: new attack types can be supported by simply adding a classifier without retraining the core agent. CyberRAG has been evaluated achieving over 94% accuracy per class and pushing final classification accuracy to 94.92% through semantic orchestration. Generated explanations score up to 0.94 in BERTScore and 4.9/5 in GPT-4-based expert evaluation. These results show that agentic, specialist-oriented RAG can pair high detection accuracy with trustworthy, SOC-ready prose, offering a practical and scalable path toward semi-autonomous cyber-defence workflows.</p></details> |  |

Existing vector search and RAG solutions largely assume abundant computation resources, making them impractical for on-device scenarios. In this paper, we propose MobileRAG, a fully on-device pipeline that overcomes these limitations by combining a mobile-friendly vector search algorithm, \textit{EcoVector}, with a lightweight \textit{Selective Content Reduction} (SCR) method. By partitioning and partially loading index data, EcoVector drastically reduces both memory footprint and CPU usage, while the SCR method filters out irrelevant text to diminish Language Model (LM) input size without degrading accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrated that MobileRAG significantly outperforms conventional vector search and RAG methods in terms of latency, memory usage, and power consumption, while maintaining accuracy and enabling offline operation to safeguard privacy in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | 14 pages |

However, complex tasks requiring multi-round retrieval remain challenging, and early attempts tend to be overly optimistic without a good sense of self-skepticism. Current multi-round RAG systems may continue searching even when enough information has already been retrieved, or they may provide incorrect answers without having sufficient information or knowledge. Existing solutions either require large amounts of expensive human-labeled process supervision data or lead to subpar performance. This paper aims to address these limitations by introducing a new framework, SIM-RAG, to explicitly enhance RAG systems' self-awareness and multi-round retrieval capabilities. To train SIM-RAG, we first let a RAG system self-practice multi-round retrieval, augmenting existing question-answer pairs with intermediate inner monologue reasoning steps to generate synthetic training data. For each pair, the system may explore multiple retrieval paths, which are labeled as successful if they reach the correct answer and unsuccessful otherwise. Using this data, we train a lightweight information sufficiency Critic. At inference time, the Critic evaluates whether the RAG system has retrieved sufficient information at each round, guiding retrieval decisions and improving system-level self-awareness through in-context reinforcement learning. Experiments across multiple prominent RAG benchmarks show that SIM-RAG is an effective multi-round RAG solution. Furthermore, this framework is system-efficient, adding a lightweight component to RAG without requiring modifications to existing LLMs or search engines, and data-efficient, eliminating the need for costly human-annotated mid-step retrieval process supervision data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 48th International ACM SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

While traditional flight control relies on hardcoded equations, recent Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential for more flexible problem-solving but struggle with reliably selecting and applying correct mathematical formulations and executing precise multi-step arithmetic. We propose RAG-UAV, a retrieval-augmented generation framework designed to improve the mathematical reasoning of several LLMs (including GPT o1/Turbo, Llama-3.2/3.3, Mistral, and DeepSeek R1) in UAV-specific contexts by providing access to relevant domain literature. To conduct an initial assessment, we introduce the UAV-Math-Bench, a 20-question problem set of UAV-centric mathematical problems across four difficulty levels. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating retrieval substantially increases exact answer accuracy (achieving up to 75% with o1), reduces instances of incorrect formulation selection (from 25% without RAG to 5\% with RAG), and decreases numerical errors, reducing Mean Squared Error (MSE) by orders of magnitude for the best-performing models. This pilot study indicates that RAG can enable general-purpose LLMs to function as more reliable tools for engineering analysis, although direct real-time flight control requires further investigation and validation on a larger scale. All benchmark data, questions, and answers are publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures, 4 appendix subsections</p></details> |

To mitigate these, recent methodologies have integrated information retrieved from external resources with LLMs, substantially enhancing their performance across NLP tasks. This survey paper addresses the absence of a comprehensive overview on Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RALMs), both Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Retrieval-Augmented Understanding (RAU), providing an in-depth examination of their paradigm, evolution, taxonomy, and applications. The paper discusses the essential components of RALMs, including Retrievers, Language Models, and Augmentations, and how their interactions lead to diverse model structures and applications. RALMs demonstrate utility in a spectrum of tasks, from translation and dialogue systems to knowledge-intensive applications. The survey includes several evaluation methods of RALMs, emphasizing the importance of robustness, accuracy, and relevance in their assessment. It also acknowledges the limitations of RALMs, particularly in retrieval quality and computational efficiency, offering directions for future research. In conclusion, this survey aims to offer a structured insight into RALMs, their potential, and the avenues for their future development in NLP.

The system is built on a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework, which integrates a curated knowledge base to ensure factual consistency. To enhance retrieval effectiveness across diverse question types, we implement a hybrid search strategy that combines dense vector similarity with sparse keyword-based retrieval. This dual-retrieval mechanism improves robustness for both general and domain-specific queries. The system includes a feedback loop in which students can rate responses and instructors can review and revise them. Instructor corrections are incorporated into the retrieval corpus, enabling adaptive refinement over time. The system was deployed in a classroom setting as a substitute for traditional office hours, where it successfully addressed a broad range of student queries. It was also used to provide technical support by integrating with a customer-specific knowledge base, demonstrating its ability to handle routine, context-sensitive tasks in applied domains.

However, LLMs often fail to faithfully integrate retrieved evidence into their generated responses, leading to factual inconsistencies. To quantify this gap, we introduce Entity-Context Divergence (ECD), a metric that measures the extent to which retrieved information is accurately reflected in model outputs. We systematically evaluate contemporary LLMs on their ability to preserve factual consistency in retrieval-augmented settings, a capability we define as RAG-ability. Our empirical analysis reveals that RAG-ability remains low across most LLMs, highlighting significant challenges in entity retention and context fidelity. This paper introduces Radiant (Retrieval AugmenteD entIty-context AligNmenT), a novel framework that merges RAG with alignment designed to optimize the interplay between retrieved evidence and generated content. Radiant extends Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to teach LLMs how to integrate provided additional information into subsequent generations. As a behavior correction mechanism, Radiant boosts RAG performance across varied retrieval scenarios, such as noisy web contexts, knowledge conflicts, and hallucination reduction. This enables more reliable, contextually grounded, and factually coherent content generation.</p></details> |  |

This research presents a complex framework that leverages Data Science methodologies, notably Large Language Models (LLM) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, to improve the efficiency of analyzing Calcutta High Court verdicts. Our framework focuses on two key aspects: first, the creation of a robust summarization mechanism that distills complex legal texts into concise and coherent summaries; and second, the development of an intelligent system for retrieving similar cases, which will assist legal professionals in research and decision making. By fine-tuning the Pegasus model using case head note summaries, we achieve significant improvements in the summarization of legal cases. Our two-step summarizing technique preserves crucial legal contexts, allowing for the production of a comprehensive vector database for RAG. The RAG-powered framework efficiently retrieves similar cases in response to user queries, offering thorough overviews and summaries. This technique not only improves legal research efficiency, but it also helps legal professionals and students easily acquire and grasp key legal information, benefiting the overall legal scenario.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Knowledge Augmented Finetuning Matters in both RAG and Agent Based Dialog Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22852v1)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to dialog systems. Despite making progress, LLMs are prone to errors in knowledge-intensive scenarios. Recently, approaches based on retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and agent have emerged to improve the factual accuracy by enhancing the LLMs with knowledge retrieved from external knowledge bases (KBs). This is mostly implemented by prompting the LLMs with instructions, examples and the retrieved knowledge. However, LLMs may have difficulty using the retrieved knowledge effectively for response generation, because they are not well trained to do such generation for specific domains. To mitigate this problem, we propose to finetune the LLMs in the RAG-based and agent-based systems with domain-specific data, together with domain-specific external knowledge, which is called knowledge augmented finetuning (KAFT). We base our study on the MobileCS2 dataset, a real-life customer service dialog dataset that features intensive knowledge interactions, to systematically compare the prompting and KAFT techniques in the RAG-based and agent-based systems. Experiment results show that KAFT substantially surpasses prompting in both RAG and agent systems, particularly in terms of factual accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this paper represents the first solid empirical work to investigate the KAFT idea.</p></details> |  |

However, there is a lack of empirical studies that report on the development of RAG-based implementations grounded in real-world use cases, evaluated through general user involvement, and accompanied by systematic documentation of lessons learned. This paper presents five domain-specific RAG applications developed for real-world scenarios across governance, cybersecurity, agriculture, industrial research, and medical diagnostics. Each system incorporates multilingual OCR, semantic retrieval via vector embeddings, and domain-adapted LLMs, deployed through local servers or cloud APIs to meet distinct user needs. A web-based evaluation involving a total of 100 participants assessed the systems across six dimensions: (i) Ease of Use, (ii) Relevance, (iii) Transparency, (iv) Responsiveness, (v) Accuracy, and (vi) Likelihood of Recommendation. Based on user feedback and our development experience, we documented twelve key lessons learned, highlighting technical, operational, and ethical challenges affecting the reliability and usability of RAG systems in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a full paper to the 51st Euromicro Conference on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications (SEAA 2025). 9 pages, 4 figures.

| **[MultiFinRAG: An Optimized Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Framework for Financial Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20821v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Financial documents--such as 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and investor presentations--span hundreds of pages and combine diverse modalities, including dense narrative text, structured tables, and complex figures. Answering questions over such content often requires joint reasoning across modalities, which strains traditional large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines due to token limitations, layout loss, and fragmented cross-modal context. We introduce MultiFinRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework purpose-built for financial QA. MultiFinRAG first performs multimodal extraction by grouping table and figure images into batches and sending them to a lightweight, quantized open-source multimodal LLM, which produces both structured JSON outputs and concise textual summaries. These outputs, along with narrative text, are embedded and indexed with modality-aware similarity thresholds for precise retrieval. A tiered fallback strategy then dynamically escalates from text-only to text+table+image contexts when necessary, enabling cross-modal reasoning while reducing irrelevant context. Despite running on commodity hardware, MultiFinRAG achieves 19 percentage points higher accuracy than ChatGPT-4o (free-tier) on complex financial QA tasks involving text, tables, images, and combined multimodal reasoning.</p></details> | Preprint Copy |
| **[CCRS: A Zero-Shot LLM-as-a-Judge Framework for Comprehensive RAG Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20128v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RAG systems enhance LLMs by incorporating external knowledge, which is crucial for domains that demand factual accuracy and up-to-date information. However, evaluating the multifaceted quality of RAG outputs, spanning aspects such as contextual coherence, query relevance, factual correctness, and informational completeness, poses significant challenges. Existing evaluation methods often rely on simple lexical overlap metrics, which are inadequate for capturing these nuances, or involve complex multi-stage pipelines with intermediate steps like claim extraction or require finetuning specialized judge models, hindering practical efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose CCRS (Contextual Coherence and Relevance Score), a novel suite of five metrics that utilizes a single, powerful, pretrained LLM as a zero-shot, end-to-end judge. CCRS evaluates: Contextual Coherence (CC), Question Relevance (QR), Information Density (ID), Answer Correctness (AC), and Information Recall (IR). We apply CCRS to evaluate six diverse RAG system configurations on the challenging BioASQ dataset. Our analysis demonstrates that CCRS effectively discriminates between system performances, confirming, for instance, that the Mistral-7B reader outperforms Llama variants. We provide a detailed analysis of CCRS metric properties, including score distributions, convergent/discriminant validity, tie rates, population statistics, and discriminative power. Compared to the complex RAGChecker framework, CCRS offers comparable or superior discriminative power for key aspects like recall and faithfulness, while being significantly more computationally efficient. CCRS thus provides a practical, comprehensive, and efficient framework for evaluating and iteratively improving RAG systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at LLM4Eval @ SIGIR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Controlled Retrieval-augmented Context Evaluation for Long-form RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20051v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models by incorporating context retrieved from external knowledge sources. While the effectiveness of the retrieval module is typically evaluated with relevance-based ranking metrics, such metrics may be insufficient to reflect the retrieval's impact on the final RAG result, especially in long-form generation scenarios. We argue that providing a comprehensive retrieval-augmented context is important for long-form RAG tasks like report generation and propose metrics for assessing the context independent of generation. We introduce CRUX, a \textbf{C}ontrolled \textbf{R}etrieval-a\textbf{U}gmented conte\textbf{X}t evaluation framework designed to directly assess retrieval-augmented contexts. This framework uses human-written summaries to control the information scope of knowledge, enabling us to measure how well the context covers information essential for long-form generation. CRUX uses question-based evaluation to assess RAG's retrieval in a fine-grained manner. Empirical results show that CRUX offers more reflective and diagnostic evaluation. Our findings also reveal substantial room for improvement in current retrieval methods, pointing to promising directions for advancing RAG's retrieval. Our data and code are publicly available to support and advance future research on retrieval.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, we propose Temporal Causal Probabilistic Description Logic (T-CPDL), an integrated framework that extends traditional Description Logic with temporal interval operators, explicit causal relationships, and probabilistic annotations. We present two distinct variants of T-CPDL: one capturing qualitative temporal relationships through Allen's interval algebra, and another variant enriched with explicit timestamped causal assertions. Both variants share a unified logical structure, enabling complex reasoning tasks ranging from simple temporal ordering to nuanced probabilistic causation. Empirical evaluations on temporal reasoning and causal inference benchmarks confirm that T-CPDL substantially improves inference accuracy, interpretability, and confidence calibration of language model outputs. By delivering transparent reasoning paths and fine-grained temporal and causal semantics, T-CPDL significantly enhances the capability of language models to support robust, explainable, and trustworthy decision-making. This work also lays the groundwork for developing advanced Logic-Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Logic-RAG) frameworks, potentially boosting the reasoning capabilities and efficiency of knowledge graph-enhanced RAG systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Standard Applicability Judgment and Cross-jurisdictional Reasoning: A RAG-based Framework for Medical Device Compliance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18511v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying the appropriate regulatory standard applicability remains a critical yet understudied challenge in medical device compliance, frequently necessitating expert interpretation of fragmented and heterogeneous documentation across different jurisdictions. To address this challenge, we introduce a modular AI system that leverages a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to automate standard applicability determination. Given a free-text device description, our system retrieves candidate standards from a curated corpus and uses large language models to infer jurisdiction-specific applicability, classified as Mandatory, Recommended, or Not Applicable, with traceable justifications. We construct an international benchmark dataset of medical device descriptions with expert-annotated standard mappings, and evaluate our system against retrieval-only, zero-shot, and rule-based baselines. The proposed approach attains a classification accuracy of 73% and a Top-5 retrieval recall of 87%, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying relevant regulatory standards. We introduce the first end-to-end system for standard applicability reasoning, enabling scalable and interpretable AI-supported regulatory science. Notably, our region-aware RAG agent performs cross-jurisdictional reasoning between Chinese and U.S. standards, supporting conflict resolution and applicability justification across regulatory frameworks.</p></details> |  |

We introduce PreQRAG, a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture designed to improve retrieval and generation quality through targeted question preprocessing. PreQRAG incorporates a pipeline that first classifies each input question as either single-document or multi-document type. For single-document questions, we employ question rewriting techniques to improve retrieval precision and generation relevance. For multi-document questions, we decompose complex queries into focused sub-questions that can be processed more effectively by downstream components. This classification and rewriting strategy improves the RAG performance. Experimental evaluation of the LiveRAG Challenge dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of our question-type-aware architecture, with PreQRAG achieving the preliminary second place in Session 2 of the LiveRAG challenge.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG</p></details> |

While RAG systems aim to leverage such communications as a knowledge base, their effectiveness is limited by raw data challenges: support tickets are typically noisy, inconsistent, and incomplete, making direct retrieval suboptimal. Unlike existing RAG approaches that focus on runtime optimization, we introduce a novel offline-first methodology that transforms these communications into a structured knowledge base. Our key innovation is a LLMs-based multi-agent system orchestrating three specialized agents: Category Discovery for taxonomy creation, Categorization for ticket grouping, and Knowledge Synthesis for article generation. Applying our methodology to real-world support tickets with resolution notes and comments, our system creates a compact knowledge base - reducing total volume to just 3.4% of original ticket data while improving quality. Experiments demonstrate that our prebuilt knowledge base in RAG systems significantly outperforms traditional RAG implementations (48.74% vs. 38.60% helpful answers) and achieves a 77.4% reduction in unhelpful responses. By automating institutional knowledge capture that typically remains siloed in experts' heads, our solution translates to substantial operational efficiency: reducing support workload, accelerating resolution times, and creating self-improving systems that automatically resolve approximately 50% of future supply chain tickets. Our approach addresses a key gap in knowledge management by transforming transient communications into structured, reusable knowledge through intelligent offline processing rather than latency-inducing runtime architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted In Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on AI for Supply Chain: Today and Future @ 31st ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining V.2 (KDD 25), August 3, 2025, Toronto, ON, Canada.

However, they also exhibit inherent limitations, such as outdated knowledge and susceptibility to hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm to address these issues, but it also introduces new vulnerabilities. Recent efforts have focused on the security of RAG-based LLMs, yet existing attack methods face three critical challenges: (1) their effectiveness declines sharply when only a limited number of poisoned texts can be injected into the knowledge database, (2) they lack sufficient stealth, as the attacks are often detectable by anomaly detection systems, which compromises their effectiveness, and (3) they rely on heuristic approaches to generate poisoned texts, lacking formal optimization frameworks and theoretic guarantees, which limits their effectiveness and applicability. To address these issues, we propose coordinated Prompt-RAG attack (PR-attack), a novel optimization-driven attack that introduces a small number of poisoned texts into the knowledge database while embedding a backdoor trigger within the prompt. When activated, the trigger causes the LLM to generate pre-designed responses to targeted queries, while maintaining normal behavior in other contexts. This ensures both high effectiveness and stealth. We formulate the attack generation process as a bilevel optimization problem leveraging a principled optimization framework to develop optimal poisoned texts and triggers. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PR-Attack, achieving a high attack success rate even with a limited number of poisoned texts and significantly improved stealth compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGIR 2025</p></details> |
| **[From RAG to Memory: Non-Parametric Continual Learning for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14802v2)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Our ability to continuously acquire, organize, and leverage knowledge is a key feature of human intelligence that AI systems must approximate to unlock their full potential. Given the challenges in continual learning with large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become the dominant way to introduce new information. However, its reliance on vector retrieval hinders its ability to mimic the dynamic and interconnected nature of human long-term memory. Recent RAG approaches augment vector embeddings with various structures like knowledge graphs to address some of these gaps, namely sense-making and associativity. However, their performance on more basic factual memory tasks drops considerably below standard RAG. We address this unintended deterioration and propose HippoRAG 2, a framework that outperforms standard RAG comprehensively on factual, sense-making, and associative memory tasks. HippoRAG 2 builds upon the Personalized PageRank algorithm used in HippoRAG and enhances it with deeper passage integration and more effective online use of an LLM. This combination pushes this RAG system closer to the effectiveness of human long-term memory, achieving a 7% improvement in associative memory tasks over the state-of-the-art embedding model while also exhibiting superior factual knowledge and sense-making memory capabilities. This work paves the way for non-parametric continual learning for LLMs. Code and data are available at https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/HippoRAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025.

| **[SGIC: A Self-Guided Iterative Calibration Framework for RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16172v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has concentrated on retrieving useful information from candidate documents. However, numerous methodologies frequently neglect the calibration capabilities of large language models (LLMs), which capitalize on their robust in-context reasoning prowess. This work illustrates that providing LLMs with specific cues substantially improves their calibration efficacy, especially in multi-round calibrations. We present a new SGIC: Self-Guided Iterative Calibration Framework that employs uncertainty scores as a tool. Initially, this framework calculates uncertainty scores to determine both the relevance of each document to the query and the confidence level in the responses produced by the LLMs. Subsequently, it reevaluates these scores iteratively, amalgamating them with prior responses to refine calibration. Furthermore, we introduce an innovative approach for constructing an iterative self-calibration training set, which optimizes LLMs to efficiently harness uncertainty scores for capturing critical information and enhancing response accuracy. Our proposed framework significantly improves performance on both closed-source and open-weight LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Legal texts are characterized by a predefined hierarchical structure, an extensive network of references and a continuous evolution through multiple temporal versions. This temporal dynamism poses a significant challenge for standard AI systems, demanding a deterministic representation of the law at any given point in time. To address this, our approach grounds the knowledge graph construction in a formal, FRBRoo-inspired model that distinguishes abstract legal works from their concrete textual expressions. We introduce a multi-layered representation of Temporal Versions (capturing date-specific changes) and Language Versions (capturing linguistic variations). By modeling normative evolution as a precise sequence of these versioned entities, we enable the construction of a knowledge graph that serves as a verifiable "ground truth". This allows Large Language Models to generate responses based on accurate, context-aware, and point-in-time correct legal information, overcoming the risk of temporal inaccuracies. Through a detailed analysis of this formal Graph RAG approach and its application to legal norm datasets, this article aims to advance the field of Artificial Intelligence applied to Law, creating opportunities for more effective and reliable systems in legal research, legislative analysis, and decision support.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version enhances the theoretical underpinnings of the proposed Graph RAG methodology, including the introduction of a formal, FRBRoo-based model for versioning, and enabling multi-language support for both content and metadata</p></details> |

It shows that LLMs struggle to capture the root causes of vulnerabilities during vulnerability detection. To address this challenge, we propose enhancing LLMs with multi-dimensional vulnerability knowledge distilled from historical vulnerabilities and fixes. We design a novel knowledge-level Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework Vul-RAG, which improves LLMs with an accuracy increase of 16% - 24% in identifying vulnerable and patched code. Additionally, vulnerability knowledge generated by Vul-RAG can further (1) serve as high-quality explanations to improve manual detection accuracy (from 60% to 77%), and (2) detect 10 previously-unknown bugs in the recent Linux kernel release with 6 assigned CVEs.</p></details> |  |

While large language models (LLMs) facilitate dynamic pedagogical interactions, hallucinations undermine confidence, trust, and instructional value. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) grounds LLM outputs in curated knowledge but requires a clear semantic link between user input and a knowledge base, which is often weak in student dialogue. We propose log-contextualized RAG (LC-RAG), which enhances RAG retrieval by using environment logs to contextualize collaborative discourse. Our findings show that LC-RAG improves retrieval over a discourse-only baseline and allows our collaborative peer agent, Copa, to deliver relevant, personalized guidance that supports students' critical thinking and epistemic decision-making in a collaborative computational modeling environment, C2STEM.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED25) Workshop on Epistemics and Decision-Making in AI-Supported Education</p></details> |

When a user submits a query, RAG executes a vector search to find relevant documents, which are then used to generate a response. However, ensuring the relevance of retrieved documents with a query would be a big challenge. To address this, a secondary model, known as a relevant grader, can be served to verify its relevance. To reduce computational requirements of a relevant grader, a lightweight small language model is preferred. In this work, we finetuned llama-3.2-1b as a relevant grader and achieved a significant increase in precision from 0.1301 to 0.7750. Its precision is comparable to that of llama-3.1-70b. Our code is available at https://github.com/taeheej/Lightweight-Relevance-Grader-in-RAG.</p></details> |  |

While RDF/OWL reasoners enable graph-based reasoning, they are limited to fragments of first-order logic, preventing deeper temporal and semantic analysis. This paper addresses both challenges by developing automatic historical event extraction models using multiple LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Llama 3.2) with three enhancement strategies: pure base generation, knowledge graph enhancement, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). We conducted comprehensive evaluations using historical texts from Thucydides. Our findings reveal that enhancement strategies optimize different performance dimensions rather than providing universal improvements. For coverage and historical breadth, base generation achieves optimal performance with Claude and GPT-4 extracting comprehensive events. However, for precision, RAG enhancement improves coordinate accuracy and metadata completeness. Model architecture fundamentally determines enhancement sensitivity: larger models demonstrate robust baseline performance with incremental RAG improvements, while Llama 3.2 shows extreme variance from competitive performance to complete failure. We then developed an automated translation pipeline converting extracted RDF representations into Coq proof assistant specifications, enabling higher-order reasoning beyond RDF capabilities including multi-step causal verification, temporal arithmetic with BC dates, and formal proofs about historical causation. The Coq formalization validates that RAG-discovered event types represent legitimate domain-specific semantic structures rather than ontological violations.</p></details> |  |

Traditional RAG pipelines often suffer from high latency and limited accuracy over massive, diverse datasets. DoTA-RAG addresses these challenges with a three-stage pipeline: query rewriting, dynamic routing to specialized sub-indexes, and multi-stage retrieval and ranking. We further enhance retrieval by evaluating and selecting a superior embedding model, re-embedding the large FineWeb-10BT corpus. Moreover, we create a diverse Q&A dataset of 500 questions generated via the DataMorgana setup across a broad range of WebOrganizer topics and formats. DoTA-RAG improves the answer correctness score from 0.752 (baseline, using LiveRAG pre-built vector store) to 1.478 while maintaining low latency, and it achieves a 0.929 correctness score on the Live Challenge Day.

Current approaches to supporting research idea generation often rely on generic large language models (LLMs). While LLMs are effective at aiding comprehension and summarization, they often fall short in guiding users toward practical research ideas due to their limitations. In this study, we present a novel structural framework for research ideation. Our framework, The Budget AI Researcher, uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) chains, vector databases, and topic-guided pairing to recombine concepts from hundreds of machine learning papers. The system ingests papers from nine major AI conferences, which collectively span the vast subfields of machine learning, and organizes them into a hierarchical topic tree. It uses the tree to identify distant topic pairs, generate novel research abstracts, and refine them through iterative self-evaluation against relevant literature and peer reviews, generating and refining abstracts that are both grounded in real-world research and demonstrably interesting. Experiments using LLM-based metrics indicate that our method significantly improves the concreteness of generated research ideas relative to standard prompting approaches. Human evaluations further demonstrate a substantial enhancement in the perceived interestingness of the outputs. By bridging the gap between academic data and creative generation, the Budget AI Researcher offers a practical, free tool for accelerating scientific discovery and lowering the barrier for aspiring researchers. Beyond research ideation, this approach inspires solutions to the broader challenge of generating personalized, context-aware outputs grounded in evolving real-world knowledge.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inten...</summary><p>Intended for AAAI's AI4Research Workshop</p></details> |

Data augmentation can potentially alleviate the data shortage, but augmenting vulnerable code is challenging and requires a generative solution that maintains vulnerability. Previous works have only focused on generating samples that contain single statements or specific types of vulnerabilities. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to solve various code generation and comprehension tasks with inspiring results, especially when fused with retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Therefore, we propose VulScribeR, a novel LLM-based solution that leverages carefully curated prompt templates to augment vulnerable datasets. More specifically, we explore three strategies to augment both single and multi-statement vulnerabilities, with LLMs, namely Mutation, Injection, and Extension. Our extensive evaluation across four vulnerability datasets and DLVD models, using three LLMs, show that our approach beats two SOTA methods Vulgen and VGX, and Random Oversampling (ROS) by 27.48%, 27.93%, and 15.41% in f1-score with 5K generated vulnerable samples on average, and 53.84%, 54.10%, 69.90%, and 40.93% with 15K generated vulnerable samples. Our approach demonstrates its feasibility for large-scale data augmentation by generating 1K samples at as cheap as US$ 1.88.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables, 3 prompt templates, 1 algorithm</p></details> |
| **[Bias Amplification in RAG: Poisoning Knowledge Retrieval to Steer LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11415v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Large Language Models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems can significantly enhance the performance of large language models by integrating external knowledge. However, RAG also introduces new security risks. Existing research focuses mainly on how poisoning attacks in RAG systems affect model output quality, overlooking their potential to amplify model biases. For example, when querying about domestic violence victims, a compromised RAG system might preferentially retrieve documents depicting women as victims, causing the model to generate outputs that perpetuate gender stereotypes even when the original query is gender neutral. To show the impact of the bias, this paper proposes a Bias Retrieval and Reward Attack (BRRA) framework, which systematically investigates attack pathways that amplify language model biases through a RAG system manipulation. We design an adversarial document generation method based on multi-objective reward functions, employ subspace projection techniques to manipulate retrieval results, and construct a cyclic feedback mechanism for continuous bias amplification. Experiments on multiple mainstream large language models demonstrate that BRRA attacks can significantly enhance model biases in dimensions. In addition, we explore a dual stage defense mechanism to effectively mitigate the impacts of the attack. This study reveals that poisoning attacks in RAG systems directly amplify model output biases and clarifies the relationship between RAG system security and model fairness. This novel potential attack indicates that we need to keep an eye on the fairness issues of the RAG system.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities to automate this translation. However, existing models still struggle with understanding domain-specific syntax and semantics. To enhance LLM performance in NL2SVA, we propose a customized retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework and a synthetic fine-tuning dataset that together improve LLM's performance. To further improve lightweight models over NL2SVA, our fine-tuning dataset provides prompt-guided explanations that teach LLMs the layer-by-layer construction process of concurrent SVAs, enabling supervised fine-tuning that greatly improves syntax and functionality accuracy. To evaluate the performance of LLMs over NL2SVA, we construct the largest evaluation dataset for NL2SVA, comprising 40 Verilog designs and 229 formally verified SVAs with detailed annotations. Experimental results show that our customized RAG framework increases the number of functionality matched SVAs by 58.42% over GPT-4o-mini, while Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct fine-tuned on our fine-tuning dataset and integrated with HybridRetrieval achieves a 59.05% over the base Qwen model.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is an exciting application of the pipeline architecture, where the final component generates a coherent answer for the users from the retrieved documents. In this demo paper, we describe how such RAG pipelines can be formulated in the declarative PyTerrier architecture, and the advantages of doing so. Our PyTerrier-RAG extension for PyTerrier provides easy access to standard RAG datasets and evaluation measures, state-of-the-art LLM readers, and using PyTerrier's unique operator notation, easy-to-build pipelines. We demonstrate the succinctness of indexing and RAG pipelines on standard datasets (including Natural Questions) and how to build on the larger PyTerrier ecosystem with state-of-the-art sparse, learned-sparse, and dense retrievers, and other neural rankers.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 3 tables, Accepted to SIGIR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Assessing RAG and HyDE on 1B vs. 4B-Parameter Gemma LLMs for Personal Assistants Integretion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21568v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Resource efficiency is a critical barrier to deploying large language models (LLMs) in edge and privacy-sensitive applications. This study evaluates the efficacy of two augmentation strategies--Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE)--on compact Gemma LLMs of 1 billion and 4 billion parameters, within the context of a privacy-first personal assistant. We implement short-term memory via MongoDB and long-term semantic storage via Qdrant, orchestrated through FastAPI and LangChain, and expose the system through a React.js frontend. Across both model scales, RAG consistently reduces latency by up to 17\% and eliminates factual hallucinations when responding to user-specific and domain-specific queries. HyDE, by contrast, enhances semantic relevance--particularly for complex physics prompts--but incurs a 25--40\% increase in response time and a non-negligible hallucination rate in personal-data retrieval. Comparing 1 B to 4 B models, we observe that scaling yields marginal throughput gains for baseline and RAG pipelines, but magnifies HyDE's computational overhead and variability. Our findings position RAG as the pragmatic choice for on-device personal assistants powered by small-scale LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report as part of research project</p></details> |
| **[Reasoning RAG via System 1 or System 2: A Survey on Reasoning Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Industry Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10408v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful framework to overcome the knowledge limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external retrieval with language generation. While early RAG systems based on static pipelines have shown effectiveness in well-structured tasks, they struggle in real-world scenarios requiring complex reasoning, dynamic retrieval, and multi-modal integration. To address these challenges, the field has shifted toward Reasoning Agentic RAG, a paradigm that embeds decision-making and adaptive tool use directly into the retrieval process. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of Reasoning Agentic RAG methods, categorizing them into two primary systems: predefined reasoning, which follows fixed modular pipelines to boost reasoning, and agentic reasoning, where the model autonomously orchestrates tool interaction during inference. We analyze representative techniques under both paradigms, covering architectural design, reasoning strategies, and tool coordination. Finally, we discuss key research challenges and propose future directions to advance the flexibility, robustness, and applicability of reasoning agentic RAG systems. Our collection of the relevant research has been organized into a https://github.com/ByebyeMonica/Reasoning-Agentic-RAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[KG-Infused RAG: Augmenting Corpus-Based RAG with External Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09542v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves factual accuracy by grounding responses in external knowledge. However, existing methods typically rely on a single source, either unstructured text or structured knowledge. Moreover, they lack cognitively inspired mechanisms for activating relevant knowledge. To address these issues, we propose KG-Infused RAG, a framework that integrates KGs into RAG systems to implement spreading activation, a cognitive process that enables concept association and inference. KG-Infused RAG retrieves KG facts, expands the query accordingly, and enhances generation by combining corpus passages with structured facts, enabling interpretable, multi-source retrieval grounded in semantic structure. We further improve KG-Infused RAG via preference learning on sampled key stages in the pipeline. Experiments on five QA benchmarks show that KG-Infused RAG consistently outperforms vanilla RAG (by 3.8% to 13.8%). Additionally, when integrated into Self-RAG, KG-Infused RAG brings further performance gains, demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility as a plug-and-play enhancement module for corpus-based RAG methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[CiteFix: Enhancing RAG Accuracy Through Post-Processing Citation Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15629v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful application of Large Language Models (LLMs), revolutionizing information search and consumption. RAG systems combine traditional search capabilities with LLMs to generate comprehensive answers to user queries, ideally with accurate citations. However, in our experience of developing a RAG product, LLMs often struggle with source attribution, aligning with other industry studies reporting citation accuracy rates of only about 74% for popular generative search engines. To address this, we present efficient post-processing algorithms to improve citation accuracy in LLM-generated responses, with minimal impact on latency and cost. Our approaches cross-check generated citations against retrieved articles using methods including keyword + semantic matching, fine tuned model with BERTScore, and a lightweight LLM-based technique. Our experimental results demonstrate a relative improvement of 15.46% in the overall accuracy metrics of our RAG system. This significant enhancement potentially enables a shift from our current larger language model to a relatively smaller model that is approximately 12x more cost-effective and 3x faster in inference time, while maintaining comparable performance. This research contributes to enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of AI-generated content in information retrieval and summarization tasks which is critical to gain customer trust especially in commercial products.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safeguarding Multimodal Knowledge Copyright in the RAG-as-a-Service Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10030v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) evolves into service-oriented platforms (Rag-as-a-Service) with shared knowledge bases, protecting the copyright of contributed data becomes essential. Existing watermarking methods in RAG focus solely on textual knowledge, leaving image knowledge unprotected. In this work, we propose AQUA, the first watermark framework for image knowledge protection in Multimodal RAG systems. AQUA embeds semantic signals into synthetic images using two complementary methods: acronym-based triggers and spatial relationship cues. These techniques ensure watermark signals survive indirect watermark propagation from image retriever to textual generator, being efficient, effective and imperceptible. Experiments across diverse models and datasets show that AQUA enables robust, stealthy, and reliable copyright tracing, filling a key gap in multimodal RAG protection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why Uncertainty Estimation Methods Fall Short in RAG: An Axiomatic Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07459v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are valued for their strong performance across various tasks, but they also produce inaccurate or misleading outputs. Uncertainty Estimation (UE) quantifies the model's confidence and helps users assess response reliability. However, existing UE methods have not been thoroughly examined in scenarios like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), where the input prompt includes non-parametric knowledge. This paper shows that current UE methods cannot reliably assess correctness in the RAG setting. We further propose an axiomatic framework to identify deficiencies in existing methods and guide the development of improved approaches. Our framework introduces five constraints that an effective UE method should meet after incorporating retrieved documents into the LLM's prompt. Experimental results reveal that no existing UE method fully satisfies all the axioms, explaining their suboptimal performance in RAG. We further introduce a simple yet effective calibration function based on our framework, which not only satisfies more axioms than baseline methods but also improves the correlation between uncertainty estimates and correctness.</p></details> |  |
| **[ScIRGen: Synthesize Realistic and Large-Scale RAG Dataset for Scientific Research](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11117v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific researchers need intensive information about datasets to effectively evaluate and develop theories and methodologies. The information needs regarding datasets are implicitly embedded in particular research tasks, rather than explicitly expressed in search queries. However, existing scientific retrieval and question-answering (QA) datasets typically address straightforward questions, which do not align with the distribution of real-world research inquiries. To bridge this gap, we developed ScIRGen, a dataset generation framework for scientific QA \& retrieval that more accurately reflects the information needs of professional science researchers, and uses it to create a large-scale scientific retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) dataset with realistic queries, datasets and papers. Technically, we designed a dataset-oriented information extraction method that leverages academic papers to augment the dataset representation. We then proposed a question generation framework by employing cognitive taxonomy to ensure the quality of synthesized questions. We also design a method to automatically filter synthetic answers based on the perplexity shift of LLMs, which is highly aligned with human judgment of answers' validity. Collectively, these methodologies culminated in the creation of the 61k QA dataset, ScIRGen-Geo. We benchmarked representative methods on the ScIRGen-Geo dataset for their question-answering and retrieval capabilities, finding out that current methods still suffer from reasoning from complex questions. This work advances the development of more sophisticated tools to support the intricate information needs of the scientific community.</p></details> | KDD 2025 Accepted |
