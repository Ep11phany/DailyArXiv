| **[msf-CNN: Patch-based Multi-Stage Fusion with Convolutional Neural Networks for TinyML](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11483v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI spans from large language models to tiny models running on microcontrollers (MCUs). Extremely memory-efficient model architectures are decisive to fit within an MCU's tiny memory budget e.g., 128kB of RAM. However, inference latency must remain small to fit real-time constraints. An approach to tackle this is patch-based fusion, which aims to optimize data flows across neural network layers. In this paper, we introduce msf-CNN, a novel technique that efficiently finds optimal fusion settings for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by walking through the fusion solution space represented as a directed acyclic graph. Compared to previous work on CNN fusion for MCUs, msf-CNN identifies a wider set of solutions. We published an implementation of msf-CNN running on various microcontrollers (ARM Cortex-M, RISC-V, ESP32). We show that msf-CNN can achieve inference using 50% less RAM compared to the prior art (MCUNetV2 and StreamNet). We thus demonstrate how msf-CNN offers additional flexibility for system designers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Assembly Code Performance with Large Language Models via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11480v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of programming tasks, yet their potential for code optimization remains underexplored. This work investigates whether LLMs can optimize the performance of assembly code, where fine-grained control over execution enables improvements that are difficult to express in high-level languages. We present a reinforcement learning framework that trains LLMs using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), guided by a reward function that considers both functional correctness, validated through test cases, and execution performance relative to the industry-standard compiler gcc -O3. To support this study, we introduce a benchmark of 8,072 real-world programs. Our model, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-PPO, achieves 96.0% test pass rates and an average speedup of 1.47x over the gcc -O3 baseline, outperforming all 20 other models evaluated, including Claude-3.7-sonnet. These results indicate that reinforcement learning can unlock the potential of LLMs to serve as effective optimizers for assembly code performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parallel Market Environments for FinRL Contests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02281v3)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Financial reinforcement learning (FinRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for sequential decision-making in financial engineering. However, applying RL in real-world trading tasks remains challenging due to the non-stationarity of financial data, low signal-to-noise ratios, and various market frictions. Although numerous FinRL methods have been developed for tasks such as trading and portfolio management, the lack of standardized task definitions, datasets, environments, and baselines has hindered consistent evaluation and reproducibility. To bridge this gap, we organized three FinRL Contests from 2023 to 2025, covering a diverse range of financial tasks such as stock trading, order execution, cryptocurrency trading, and the use of large language model (LLM)-generated signals. These contests attracted 200 participants from over 100 institutions across 22 countries. To promote reproduction, we provided open-source starter kits featuring GPU-optimized parallel market environments and comprehensive documentation. In this paper, we summarize these benchmarking efforts, detailing task formulations, data curation pipelines, environment implementations, evaluation protocols, participant performance, and key organizational insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2501.10709</p></details> |
| **[HelpSteer3-Preference: Open Human-Annotated Preference Data across Diverse Tasks and Languages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11475v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preference datasets are essential for training general-domain, instruction-following language models with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Each subsequent data release raises expectations for future data collection, meaning there is a constant need to advance the quality and diversity of openly available preference data. To address this need, we introduce HelpSteer3-Preference, a permissively licensed (CC-BY-4.0), high-quality, human-annotated preference dataset comprising of over 40,000 samples. These samples span diverse real-world applications of large language models (LLMs), including tasks relating to STEM, coding and multilingual scenarios. Using HelpSteer3-Preference, we train Reward Models (RMs) that achieve top performance on RM-Bench (82.4%) and JudgeBench (73.7%). This represents a substantial improvement (~10% absolute) over the previously best-reported results from existing RMs. We demonstrate HelpSteer3-Preference can also be applied to train Generative RMs and how policy models can be aligned with RLHF using our RMs. Dataset (CC-BY-4.0): https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/HelpSteer3#preference</p></details> | 38 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Disentangling Reasoning and Knowledge in Medical Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11462v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical reasoning in large language models (LLMs) aims to emulate clinicians' diagnostic thinking, but current benchmarks such as MedQA-USMLE, MedMCQA, and PubMedQA often mix reasoning with factual recall. We address this by separating 11 biomedical QA benchmarks into reasoning- and knowledge-focused subsets using a PubMedBERT classifier that reaches 81 percent accuracy, comparable to human performance. Our analysis shows that only 32.8 percent of questions require complex reasoning. We evaluate biomedical models (HuatuoGPT-o1, MedReason, m1) and general-domain models (DeepSeek-R1, o4-mini, Qwen3), finding consistent gaps between knowledge and reasoning performance. For example, m1 scores 60.5 on knowledge but only 47.1 on reasoning. In adversarial tests where models are misled with incorrect initial reasoning, biomedical models degrade sharply, while larger or RL-trained general models show more robustness. To address this, we train BioMed-R1 using fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on reasoning-heavy examples. It achieves the strongest performance among similarly sized models. Further gains may come from incorporating clinical case reports and training with adversarial and backtracking scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProxyPrompt: Securing System Prompts against Prompt Extraction Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11459v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of large language models (LLMs) into a wide range of applications has highlighted the critical role of well-crafted system prompts, which require extensive testing and domain expertise. These prompts enhance task performance but may also encode sensitive information and filtering criteria, posing security risks if exposed. Recent research shows that system prompts are vulnerable to extraction attacks, while existing defenses are either easily bypassed or require constant updates to address new threats. In this work, we introduce ProxyPrompt, a novel defense mechanism that prevents prompt leakage by replacing the original prompt with a proxy. This proxy maintains the original task's utility while obfuscating the extracted prompt, ensuring attackers cannot reproduce the task or access sensitive information. Comprehensive evaluations on 264 LLM and system prompt pairs show that ProxyPrompt protects 94.70% of prompts from extraction attacks, outperforming the next-best defense, which only achieves 42.80%.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs unlock new paths to monetizing exploits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11449v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We argue that Large language models (LLMs) will soon alter the economics of cyberattacks. Instead of attacking the most commonly used software and monetizing exploits by targeting the lowest common denominator among victims, LLMs enable adversaries to launch tailored attacks on a user-by-user basis. On the exploitation front, instead of human attackers manually searching for one difficult-to-identify bug in a product with millions of users, LLMs can find thousands of easy-to-identify bugs in products with thousands of users. And on the monetization front, instead of generic ransomware that always performs the same attack (encrypt all your data and request payment to decrypt), an LLM-driven ransomware attack could tailor the ransom demand based on the particular content of each exploited device. We show that these two attacks (and several others) are imminently practical using state-of-the-art LLMs. For example, we show that without any human intervention, an LLM finds highly sensitive personal information in the Enron email dataset (e.g., an executive having an affair with another employee) that could be used for blackmail. While some of our attacks are still too expensive to scale widely today, the incentives to implement these attacks will only increase as LLMs get cheaper. Thus, we argue that LLMs create a need for new defense-in-depth approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[COBIAS: Assessing the Contextual Reliability of Bias Benchmarks for Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14889v4)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) often inherit biases from the web data they are trained on, which contains stereotypes and prejudices. Current methods for evaluating and mitigating these biases rely on bias-benchmark datasets. These benchmarks measure bias by observing an LLM's behavior on biased statements. However, these statements lack contextual considerations of the situations they try to present. To address this, we introduce a contextual reliability framework, which evaluates model robustness to biased statements by considering the various contexts in which they may appear. We develop the Context-Oriented Bias Indicator and Assessment Score (COBIAS) to measure a biased statement's reliability in detecting bias, based on the variance in model behavior across different contexts. To evaluate the metric, we augmented 2,291 stereotyped statements from two existing benchmark datasets by adding contextual information. We show that COBIAS aligns with human judgment on the contextual reliability of biased statements (Spearman's $\rho = 0.65, p = 3.4 * 10^{-60}$) and can be used to create reliable benchmarks, which would assist bias mitigation works.</p></details> |  |
| **[Is Compression Really Linear with Code Intelligence?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11441v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the relationship between data compression and the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial, especially in specialized domains like code intelligence. Prior work posited a linear relationship between compression and general intelligence. However, it overlooked the multifaceted nature of code that encompasses diverse programming languages and tasks, and struggled with fair evaluation of modern Code LLMs. We address this by evaluating a diverse array of open-source Code LLMs on comprehensive multi-language, multi-task code benchmarks. To address the challenge of efficient and fair evaluation of pre-trained LLMs' code intelligence, we introduce \textit{Format Annealing}, a lightweight, transparent training methodology designed to assess the intrinsic capabilities of these pre-trained models equitably. Compression efficacy, measured as bits-per-character (BPC), is determined using a novel, large-scale, and previously unseen code validation set derived from GitHub. Our empirical results reveal a fundamental logarithmic relationship between measured code intelligence and BPC. This finding refines prior hypotheses of linearity, which we suggest are likely observations of the logarithmic curve's tail under specific, limited conditions. Our work provides a more nuanced understanding of compression's role in developing code intelligence and contributes a robust evaluation framework in the code domain.</p></details> | work in progress |
| **[VideoHallu: Evaluating and Mitigating Multi-modal Hallucinations on Synthetic Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01481v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic video generation has gained significant attention for its realism and broad applications, but remains prone to violations of common sense and physical laws. This highlights the need for reliable abnormality detectors that understand such principles and are robust to hallucinations. To address this, we introduce VideoHallu, a benchmark of over 3,000 video QA pairs built from synthetic videos generated by models like Veo2, Sora, and Kling, paired with expert-crafted counterintuitive QA to evaluate the critical thinking abilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on abnormalities that are perceptually obvious to humans but often hallucinated due to language priors. VideoHallu evaluates MLLMs' abnormality detection abilities with examples across alignment, consistency, commonsense, and physics. We benchmark SOTA MLLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Qwen2.5-VL, Video-R1, and VideoChat-R1. We observe that these models perform well on many real-world benchmarks like MVBench and MovieChat, but still struggle with basic physics-based and commonsense reasoning in synthetic videos. We further show that post-training with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), using curriculum learning on datasets combining video QA with counterintuitive commonsense and physics reasoning over real and synthetic videos, improves MLLMs' abnormality detection and critical thinking, demonstrating the value of targeted training for improving their understanding of commonsense and physical laws.</p></details> |  |
| **[GODBench: A Benchmark for Multimodal Large Language Models in Video Comment Art](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11436v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Comment Art enhances user engagement by providing creative content that conveys humor, satire, or emotional resonance, requiring a nuanced and comprehensive grasp of cultural and contextual subtleties. Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) have demonstrated strong reasoning abilities in STEM tasks (e.g. mathematics and coding), they still struggle to generate creative expressions such as resonant jokes and insightful satire. Moreover, existing benchmarks are constrained by their limited modalities and insufficient categories, hindering the exploration of comprehensive creativity in video-based Comment Art creation. To address these limitations, we introduce GODBench, a novel benchmark that integrates video and text modalities to systematically evaluate MLLMs' abilities to compose Comment Art. Furthermore, inspired by the propagation patterns of waves in physics, we propose Ripple of Thought (RoT), a multi-step reasoning framework designed to enhance the creativity of MLLMs. Extensive experiments reveal that existing MLLMs and CoT methods still face significant challenges in understanding and generating creative video comments. In contrast, RoT provides an effective approach to improve creative composing, highlighting its potential to drive meaningful advancements in MLLM-based creativity. GODBench is publicly available at https://github.com/stan-lei/GODBench-ACL2025.</p></details> | <details><summary>69 pa...</summary><p>69 pages, 66 figures, accepted by ACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[MegaScale-MoE: Large-Scale Communication-Efficient Training of Mixture-of-Experts Models in Production](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11432v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present MegaScale-MoE, a production system tailored for the efficient training of large-scale mixture-of-experts (MoE) models. MoE emerges as a promising architecture to scale large language models (LLMs) to unprecedented sizes, thereby enhancing model performance. However, existing MoE training systems experience a degradation in training efficiency, exacerbated by the escalating scale of MoE models and the continuous evolution of hardware. Recognizing the pivotal role of efficient communication in enhancing MoE training, MegaScale-MoE customizes communication-efficient parallelism strategies for attention and FFNs in each MoE layer and adopts a holistic approach to overlap communication with computation at both inter- and intra-operator levels. Additionally, MegaScale-MoE applies communication compression with adjusted communication patterns to lower precision, further improving training efficiency. When training a 352B MoE model on 1,440 NVIDIA Hopper GPUs, MegaScale-MoE achieves a training throughput of 1.41M tokens/s, improving the efficiency by 1.88$\times$ compared to Megatron-LM. We share our operational experience in accelerating MoE training and hope that by offering our insights in system design, this work will motivate future research in MoE systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Vision-Language Models as Evaluators in Path Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18711v4)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their promise to perform complex reasoning, large language models (LLMs) have been shown to have limited effectiveness in end-to-end planning. This has inspired an intriguing question: if these models cannot plan well, can they still contribute to the planning framework as a helpful plan evaluator? In this work, we generalize this question to consider LLMs augmented with visual understanding, i.e., Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We introduce PathEval, a novel benchmark evaluating VLMs as plan evaluators in complex path-planning scenarios. Succeeding in the benchmark requires a VLM to be able to abstract traits of optimal paths from the scenario description, demonstrate precise low-level perception on each path, and integrate this information to decide the better path. Our analysis of state-of-the-art VLMs reveals that these models face significant challenges on the benchmark. We observe that the VLMs can precisely abstract given scenarios to identify the desired traits and exhibit mixed performance in integrating the provided information. Yet, their vision component presents a critical bottleneck, with models struggling to perceive low-level details about a path. Our experimental results show that this issue cannot be trivially addressed via end-to-end fine-tuning; rather, task-specific discriminative adaptation of these vision encoders is needed for these VLMs to become effective path evaluators.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2025 IEEE / CVF Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Conference (CVPR)</p></details> |
| **[When Thinking Fails: The Pitfalls of Reasoning for Instruction-Following in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11423v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning-enhanced large language models (RLLMs), whether explicitly trained for reasoning or prompted via chain-of-thought (CoT), have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many complex reasoning tasks. However, we uncover a surprising and previously overlooked phenomenon: explicit CoT reasoning can significantly degrade instruction-following accuracy. Evaluating 15 models on two benchmarks: IFEval (with simple, rule-verifiable constraints) and ComplexBench (with complex, compositional constraints), we consistently observe performance drops when CoT prompting is applied. Through large-scale case studies and an attention-based analysis, we identify common patterns where reasoning either helps (e.g., with formatting or lexical precision) or hurts (e.g., by neglecting simple constraints or introducing unnecessary content). We propose a metric, constraint attention, to quantify model focus during generation and show that CoT reasoning often diverts attention away from instruction-relevant tokens. To mitigate these effects, we introduce and evaluate four strategies: in-context learning, self-reflection, self-selective reasoning, and classifier-selective reasoning. Our results demonstrate that selective reasoning strategies, particularly classifier-selective reasoning, can substantially recover lost performance. To our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically expose reasoning-induced failures in instruction-following and offer practical mitigation strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[EdgeWisePersona: A Dataset for On-Device User Profiling from Natural Language Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11417v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel dataset and evaluation benchmark designed to assess and improve small language models deployable on edge devices, with a focus on user profiling from multi-session natural language interactions in smart home environments. At the core of the dataset are structured user profiles, each defined by a set of routines - context-triggered, repeatable patterns of behavior that govern how users interact with their home systems. Using these profiles as input, a large language model (LLM) generates corresponding interaction sessions that simulate realistic, diverse, and context-aware dialogues between users and their devices. The primary task supported by this dataset is profile reconstruction: inferring user routines and preferences solely from interactions history. To assess how well current models can perform this task under realistic conditions, we benchmarked several state-of-the-art compact language models and compared their performance against large foundation models. Our results show that while small models demonstrate some capability in reconstructing profiles, they still fall significantly short of large models in accurately capturing user behavior. This performance gap poses a major challenge - particularly because on-device processing offers critical advantages, such as preserving user privacy, minimizing latency, and enabling personalized experiences without reliance on the cloud. By providing a realistic, structured testbed for developing and evaluating behavioral modeling under these constraints, our dataset represents a key step toward enabling intelligent, privacy-respecting AI systems that learn and adapt directly on user-owned devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoE-CAP: Benchmarking Cost, Accuracy and Performance of Sparse Mixture-of-Experts Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11415v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture is increasingly favored for scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiently, but it depends on heterogeneous compute and memory resources. These factors jointly affect system Cost, Accuracy, and Performance (CAP), making trade-offs inevitable. Existing benchmarks often fail to capture these trade-offs accurately, complicating practical deployment decisions. To address this, we introduce MoE-CAP, a benchmark specifically designed for MoE systems. Our analysis reveals that achieving an optimal balance across CAP is difficult with current hardware; MoE systems typically optimize two of the three dimensions at the expense of the third-a dynamic we term the MoE-CAP trade-off. To visualize this, we propose the CAP Radar Diagram. We further introduce sparsity-aware performance metrics-Sparse Memory Bandwidth Utilization (S-MBU) and Sparse Model FLOPS Utilization (S-MFU)-to enable accurate performance benchmarking of MoE systems across diverse hardware platforms and deployment scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2412.07067</p></details> |
| **[CARES: Comprehensive Evaluation of Safety and Adversarial Robustness in Medical LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11413v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in medical contexts, raising critical concerns about safety, alignment, and susceptibility to adversarial manipulation. While prior benchmarks assess model refusal capabilities for harmful prompts, they often lack clinical specificity, graded harmfulness levels, and coverage of jailbreak-style attacks. We introduce CARES (Clinical Adversarial Robustness and Evaluation of Safety), a benchmark for evaluating LLM safety in healthcare. CARES includes over 18,000 prompts spanning eight medical safety principles, four harm levels, and four prompting styles: direct, indirect, obfuscated, and role-play, to simulate both malicious and benign use cases. We propose a three-way response evaluation protocol (Accept, Caution, Refuse) and a fine-grained Safety Score metric to assess model behavior. Our analysis reveals that many state-of-the-art LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreaks that subtly rephrase harmful prompts, while also over-refusing safe but atypically phrased queries. Finally, we propose a mitigation strategy using a lightweight classifier to detect jailbreak attempts and steer models toward safer behavior via reminder-based conditioning. CARES provides a rigorous framework for testing and improving medical LLM safety under adversarial and ambiguous conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual Planning: Let's Think Only with Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11409v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal extensions (MLLMs) have substantially enhanced machine reasoning across diverse tasks. However, these models predominantly rely on pure text as the medium for both expressing and structuring reasoning, even when visual information is present. In this work, we argue that language may not always be the most natural or effective modality for reasoning, particularly in tasks involving spatial and geometrical information. Motivated by this, we propose a new paradigm, Visual Planning, which enables planning through purely visual representations, independent of text. In this paradigm, planning is executed via sequences of images that encode step-by-step inference in the visual domain, akin to how humans sketch or visualize future actions. We introduce a novel reinforcement learning framework, Visual Planning via Reinforcement Learning (VPRL), empowered by GRPO for post-training large vision models, leading to substantial improvements in planning in a selection of representative visual navigation tasks, FrozenLake, Maze, and MiniBehavior. Our visual planning paradigm outperforms all other planning variants that conduct reasoning in the text-only space. Our results establish Visual Planning as a viable and promising alternative to language-based reasoning, opening new avenues for tasks that benefit from intuitive, image-based inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 1 table (26 pages, 12 figures, 8 tables including references and appendices)</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Model Use Impact Locus of Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11406v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI tools increasingly shape how we write, they may also quietly reshape how we perceive ourselves. This paper explores the psychological impact of co-writing with AI on people's locus of control. Through an empirical study with 462 participants, we found that employment status plays a critical role in shaping users' reliance on AI and their locus of control. Current results demonstrated that employed participants displayed higher reliance on AI and a shift toward internal control, while unemployed users tended to experience a reduction in personal agency. Through quantitative results and qualitative observations, this study opens a broader conversation about AI's role in shaping personal agency and identity.</p></details> |  |
| **[EmotionHallucer: Evaluating Emotion Hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11405v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emotion understanding is a critical yet challenging task. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced their capabilities in this area. However, MLLMs often suffer from hallucinations, generating irrelevant or nonsensical content. To the best of our knowledge, despite the importance of this issue, there has been no dedicated effort to evaluate emotion-related hallucinations in MLLMs. In this work, we introduce EmotionHallucer, the first benchmark for detecting and analyzing emotion hallucinations in MLLMs. Unlike humans, whose emotion understanding stems from the interplay of biology and social learning, MLLMs rely solely on data-driven learning and lack innate emotional instincts. Fortunately, emotion psychology provides a solid foundation of knowledge about human emotions. Building on this, we assess emotion hallucinations from two dimensions: emotion psychology knowledge and real-world multimodal perception. To support robust evaluation, we utilize an adversarial binary question-answer (QA) framework, which employs carefully crafted basic and hallucinated pairs to assess the emotion hallucination tendencies of MLLMs. By evaluating 38 LLMs and MLLMs on EmotionHallucer, we reveal that: i) most current models exhibit substantial issues with emotion hallucinations; ii) closed-source models outperform open-source ones in detecting emotion hallucinations, and reasoning capability provides additional advantages; iii) existing models perform better in emotion psychology knowledge than in multimodal emotion perception. As a byproduct, these findings inspire us to propose the PEP-MEK framework, which yields an average improvement of 9.90% in emotion hallucination detection across selected models. Resources will be available at https://github.com/xxtars/EmotionHallucer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Shot Statistical Tests for LLM-Generated Text Detection using Finite Sample Concentration Inequalities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02406v4)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Verifying the provenance of content is crucial to the function of many organizations, e.g., educational institutions, social media platforms, firms, etc. This problem is becoming increasingly challenging as text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) becomes almost indistinguishable from human-generated content. In addition, many institutions utilize in-house LLMs and want to ensure that external, non-sanctioned LLMs do not produce content within the institution. In this paper, we answer the following question: Given a piece of text, can we identify whether it was produced by a particular LLM or not? We model LLM-generated text as a sequential stochastic process with complete dependence on history. We then design zero-shot statistical tests to (i) distinguish between text generated by two different known sets of LLMs $A$ (non-sanctioned) and $B$ (in-house), and (ii) identify whether text was generated by a known LLM or generated by any unknown model, e.g., a human or some other language generation process. We prove that the type I and type II errors of our test decrease exponentially with the length of the text. For that, we show that if $B$ generates the text, then except with an exponentially small probability in string length, the log-perplexity of the string under $A$ converges to the average cross-entropy of $B$ and $A$. We then present experiments using LLMs with white-box access to support our theoretical results and empirically examine the robustness of our results to black-box settings and adversarial attacks. In the black-box setting, our method achieves an average TPR of 82.5\% at a fixed FPR of 5\%. Under adversarial perturbations, our minimum TPR is 48.6\% at the same FPR threshold. Both results outperform all non-commercial baselines. See https://github.com/TaraRadvand74/llm-text-detection for code, data, and an online demo of the project.</p></details> |  |
| **[Does Reinforcement Learning Really Incentivize Reasoning Capacity in LLMs Beyond the Base Model?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13837v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently demonstrated notable success in enhancing the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), particularly on mathematics and programming tasks. Similar to how traditional RL helps agents explore and learn new strategies, RLVR is believed to enable LLMs to continuously self-improve, thus acquiring novel reasoning abilities beyond those of the corresponding base models. In this study we critically examine the current state of RLVR by systematically probing the reasoning capability boundaries of RLVR-trained LLMs across various model families, RL algorithms, and math, coding, and visual reasoning benchmarks, using pass@k at large k values as the evaluation metric. Surprisingly, we find that the current training setup does not elicit fundamentally new reasoning patterns. While RLVR-trained models outperform their base models at small k (e.g., k = 1), the base models achieve a higher pass@k score when k is large. Coverage and perplexity analyses show that the observed reasoning abilities originate from and are bounded by the base model. Treating the base model as an upper bound, our quantitative analysis shows that six popular RLVR algorithms perform similarly and remain far from optimal in leveraging the potential of the base model. By contrast, we find that distillation can introduce new reasoning patterns from the teacher and genuinely expand the model's reasoning capabilities. Overall, our findings suggest that current RLVR methods have not yet realized the potential of RL to elicit truly novel reasoning abilities in LLMs. This highlights the need for improved RL paradigms, such as continual scaling and multi-turn agent-environment interaction, to unlock this potential.</p></details> | 30 pages, 27 figures |
| **[Leveraging Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation to Support Learners' Understanding of Knowledge Concepts in MOOCs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10074v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) lack direct interaction between learners and instructors, making it challenging for learners to understand new knowledge concepts. Recently, learners have increasingly used Large Language Models (LLMs) to support them in acquiring new knowledge. However, LLMs are prone to hallucinations which limits their reliability. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this issue by retrieving relevant documents before generating a response. However, the application of RAG across different MOOCs is limited by unstructured learning material. Furthermore, current RAG systems do not actively guide learners toward their learning needs. To address these challenges, we propose a Graph RAG pipeline that leverages Educational Knowledge Graphs (EduKGs) and Personal Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) to guide learners to understand knowledge concepts in the MOOC platform CourseMapper. Specifically, we implement (1) a PKG-based Question Generation method to recommend personalized questions for learners in context, and (2) an EduKG-based Question Answering method that leverages the relationships between knowledge concepts in the EduKG to answer learner selected questions. To evaluate both methods, we conducted a study with 3 expert instructors on 3 different MOOCs in the MOOC platform CourseMapper. The results of the evaluation show the potential of Graph RAG to empower learners to understand new knowledge concepts in a personalized learning experience.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMOOCs 2025</p></details> |
| **[GuideBench: Benchmarking Domain-Oriented Guideline Following for LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11368v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed as autonomous agents capable of following user instructions and making decisions in real-world applications. Previous studies have made notable progress in benchmarking the instruction following capabilities of LLMs in general domains, with a primary focus on their inherent commonsense knowledge. Recently, LLMs have been increasingly deployed as domain-oriented agents, which rely on domain-oriented guidelines that may conflict with their commonsense knowledge. These guidelines exhibit two key characteristics: they consist of a wide range of domain-oriented rules and are subject to frequent updates. Despite these challenges, the absence of comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating the domain-oriented guideline following capabilities of LLMs presents a significant obstacle to their effective assessment and further development. In this paper, we introduce GuideBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate guideline following performance of LLMs. GuideBench evaluates LLMs on three critical aspects: (i) adherence to diverse rules, (ii) robustness to rule updates, and (iii) alignment with human preferences. Experimental results on a range of LLMs indicate substantial opportunities for improving their ability to follow domain-oriented guidelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

We introduce Phare, a multilingual diagnostic framework to probe and evaluate LLM behavior across three critical dimensions: hallucination and reliability, social biases, and harmful content generation. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals patterns of systematic vulnerabilities across all safety dimensions, including sycophancy, prompt sensitivity, and stereotype reproduction. By highlighting these specific failure modes rather than simply ranking models, Phare provides researchers and practitioners with actionable insights to build more robust, aligned, and trustworthy language systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[EIAD: Explainable Industrial Anomaly Detection Via Multi-Modal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14162v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD) is critical to ensure product quality during manufacturing. Although existing zero-shot defect segmentation and detection methods have shown effectiveness, they cannot provide detailed descriptions of the defects. Furthermore, the application of large multi-modal models in IAD remains in its infancy, facing challenges in balancing question-answering (QA) performance and mask-based grounding capabilities, often owing to overfitting during the fine-tuning process. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that introduces a dedicated multi-modal defect localization module to decouple the dialog functionality from the core feature extraction. This decoupling is achieved through independent optimization objectives and tailored learning strategies. Additionally, we contribute to the first multi-modal industrial anomaly detection training dataset, named Defect Detection Question Answering (DDQA), encompassing a wide range of defect types and industrial scenarios. Unlike conventional datasets that rely on GPT-generated data, DDQA ensures authenticity and reliability and offers a robust foundation for model training. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method, Explainable Industrial Anomaly Detection Assistant (EIAD), achieves outstanding performance in defect detection and localization tasks. It not only significantly enhances accuracy but also improves interpretability. These advancements highlight the potential of EIAD for practical applications in industrial settings.</p></details> | Accepted by ICME2025 |

To address this, we propose Mask-Enhanced Autoregressive Prediction (MEAP), a simple yet effective training paradigm that seamlessly integrates Masked Language Modeling (MLM) into Next-Token Prediction (NTP) to enhance the latter's in-context retrieval capabilities. Specifically, MEAP first randomly masks a small fraction of input tokens and then directly performs the standard next-token prediction autoregressive using a decoder-only Transformer. MEAP eliminates the need for bidirectional attention or encoder-decoder architectures for MLM, incurring no additional computational overhead during pre-training or inference. Intensive experiments demonstrate that MEAP substantially outperforms NTP on key information retrieval and long-context reasoning tasks, while performing on par or better on commonsense reasoning tasks. The benefits of MEAP also extend to supervised fine-tuning, where it shows remarkable advantages in lost-in-the-middle scenarios, outperforming NTP by 11.77 percentage points. Our analysis indicates that MEAP's effectiveness arises from its ability to promote more distinguishable attention scores by concentrating on a reduced set of non-masked tokens. This mechanism improves the model's focus on task-relevant signals while mitigating the influence of peripheral context. These findings position MEAP as a promising training paradigm for large language models.</p></details> | 17 pages,7 figures |
| **[Uncertainty Quantification for LLM-Based Survey Simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17773v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the use of large language models (LLMs) to simulate human responses to survey questions, and perform uncertainty quantification to gain reliable insights. Our approach converts imperfect LLM-simulated responses into confidence sets for population parameters of human responses, addressing the distribution shift between the simulated and real populations. A key innovation lies in determining the optimal number of simulated responses: too many produce overly narrow confidence sets with poor coverage, while too few yield excessively loose estimates. To resolve this, our method adaptively selects the simulation sample size, ensuring valid average-case coverage guarantees. It is broadly applicable to any LLM, irrespective of its fidelity, and any procedure for constructing confidence sets. Additionally, the selected sample size quantifies the degree of misalignment between the LLM and the target human population. We illustrate our method on real datasets and LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 7 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |
| **[LegoSLM: Connecting LLM with Speech Encoder using CTC Posteriors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11352v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, large-scale pre-trained speech encoders and Large Language Models (LLMs) have been released, which show state-of-the-art performance on a range of spoken language processing tasks including Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). To effectively combine both models for better performance, continuous speech prompts, and ASR error correction have been adopted. However, these methods are prone to suboptimal performance or are inflexible. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm, LegoSLM, that bridges speech encoders and LLMs using the ASR posterior matrices. The speech encoder is trained to generate Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) posteriors over the LLM vocabulary, which are used to reconstruct pseudo-audio embeddings by computing a weighted sum of the LLM input embeddings. These embeddings are concatenated with text embeddings in the LLM input space. Using the well-performing USM and Gemma models as an example, we demonstrate that our proposed LegoSLM method yields good performance on both ASR and speech translation tasks. By connecting USM with Gemma models, we can get an average of 49% WERR over the USM-CTC baseline on 8 MLS testsets. The trained model also exhibits modularity in a range of settings -- after fine-tuning the Gemma model weights, the speech encoder can be switched and combined with the LLM in a zero-shot fashion. Additionally, we propose to control the decode-time influence of the USM and LLM using a softmax temperature, which shows effectiveness in domain adaptation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context parroting: A simple but tough-to-beat baseline for foundation models in scientific machine learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11349v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently-developed time series foundation models for scientific machine learning exhibit emergent abilities to predict physical systems. These abilities include zero-shot forecasting, in which a model forecasts future states of a system given only a short trajectory as context. Here, we show that foundation models applied to physical systems can give accurate predictions, but that they fail to develop meaningful representations of the underlying physics. Instead, foundation models often forecast by context parroting, a simple zero-shot forecasting strategy that copies directly from the context. As a result, a naive direct context parroting model scores higher than state-of-the-art time-series foundation models on predicting a diverse range of dynamical systems, at a tiny fraction of the computational cost. We draw a parallel between context parroting and induction heads, which explains why large language models trained on text can be repurposed for time series forecasting. Our dynamical systems perspective also ties the scaling between forecast accuracy and context length to the fractal dimension of the attractor, providing insight into the previously observed in-context neural scaling laws. Context parroting thus serves as a simple but tough-to-beat baseline for future time-series foundation models and can help identify in-context learning strategies beyond parroting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Critical Questions Generation: A Challenging Reasoning Task for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11341v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of Critical Questions Generation (CQs-Gen) aims to foster critical thinking by enabling systems to generate questions that expose assumptions and challenge the reasoning in arguments. Despite growing interest in this area, progress has been hindered by the lack of suitable datasets and automatic evaluation standards. This work presents a comprehensive approach to support the development and benchmarking of systems for this task. We construct the first large-scale manually-annotated dataset. We also investigate automatic evaluation methods and identify a reference-based technique using large language models (LLMs) as the strategy that best correlates with human judgments. Our zero-shot evaluation of 11 LLMs establishes a strong baseline while showcasing the difficulty of the task. Data, code, and a public leaderboard are provided to encourage further research not only in terms of model performance, but also to explore the practical benefits of CQs-Gen for both automated reasoning and human critical thinking.</p></details> |  |
| **[XtraGPT: LLMs for Human-AI Collaboration on Controllable Academic Paper Revision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11336v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the growing adoption of large language models (LLMs) in academic workflows, their capabilities remain limited when it comes to supporting high-quality scientific writing. Most existing systems are designed for general-purpose scientific text generation and fail to meet the sophisticated demands of research communication beyond surface-level polishing, such as conceptual coherence across sections. Furthermore, academic writing is inherently iterative and revision-driven, a process not well supported by direct prompting-based paradigms. To address these scenarios, we propose a human-AI collaboration framework for academic paper revision. We first introduce a comprehensive dataset of 7,040 research papers from top-tier venues annotated with over 140,000 instruction-response pairs that reflect realistic, section-level scientific revisions. Building on the dataset, we develop XtraGPT, the first suite of open-source LLMs, designed to provide context-aware, instruction-guided writing assistance, ranging from 1.5B to 14B parameters. Extensive experiments validate that XtraGPT significantly outperforms same-scale baselines and approaches the quality of proprietary systems. Both automated preference assessments and human evaluations confirm the effectiveness of our models in improving scientific drafts.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[TokenWeave: Efficient Compute-Communication Overlap for Distributed LLM Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11329v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed inference of large language models (LLMs) can introduce overheads of up to 20% even over GPUs connected via high-speed interconnects such as NVLINK. Multiple techniques have been proposed to mitigate these overheads by decomposing computations into finer-grained tasks and overlapping communication with sub-tasks as they complete. However, fine-grained decomposition of a large computation into many smaller computations on GPUs results in overheads. Further, the communication itself uses many streaming multiprocessors (SMs), adding to the overhead. We present TokenWeave to address these challenges. TokenWeave proposes a Token-Splitting technique that divides the tokens in the inference batch into two approximately equal subsets in a wave-aware manner. The computation of one subset is then overlapped with the communication of the other. In addition, TokenWeave optimizes the order of the layer normalization computation with respect to communication operations and implements a novel fused AllReduce-RMSNorm kernel carefully leveraging Multimem instruction support available on NVIDIA Hopper GPUs. These optimizations allow TokenWeave to perform communication and RMSNorm using only 2-8 SMs. Moreover, our kernel enables the memory bound RMSNorm to be overlapped with the other batch's computation, providing additional gains. Our evaluations demonstrate up to 29% latency gains and up to 26% throughput gains across multiple models and workloads. In several settings, TokenWeave results in better performance compared to an equivalent model with all communication removed.</p></details> | 13 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Mixture of Routers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23362v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a milestone in aligning large language models with human instructions and adapting them to downstream tasks. In particular, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained widespread attention due to its parameter efficiency. However, its impact on improving the performance of large models remains limited. Recent studies suggest that combining LoRA with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) can significantly enhance fine-tuning performance. MoE adapts to the diversity and complexity of datasets by dynamically selecting the most suitable experts, thereby improving task accuracy and efficiency. Despite impressive results, recent studies reveal issues in the MoE routing mechanism, such as incorrect assignments and imbalanced expert allocation. Inspired by the principles of Redundancy and Fault Tolerance Theory. We innovatively integrate the concept of Mixture of Experts into the routing mechanism and propose an efficient fine-tuning method called Mixture of Routers (MoR). It employs multiple sub-routers for joint selection and uses a learnable main router to determine the weights of the sub-routers. The results show that MoR outperforms baseline models on most tasks, achieving an average performance improvement of 1%. MoR can serve as a plug-and-play, parameter-efficient fine-tuning method suitable for a wide range of applications. Our code is available here: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MoR-DFC6.</p></details> | 10 pages,4 figures |

We introduce XRAG, an open-source, modular codebase that facilitates exhaustive evaluation of the performance of foundational components of advanced RAG modules. These components are systematically categorized into four core phases: pre-retrieval, retrieval, post-retrieval, and generation. We systematically analyse them across reconfigured datasets, providing a comprehensive benchmark for their effectiveness. As the complexity of RAG systems continues to escalate, we underscore the critical need to identify potential failure points in RAG systems. We formulate a suite of experimental methodologies and diagnostic testing protocols to dissect the failure points inherent in RAG engineering. Subsequently, we proffer bespoke solutions aimed at bolstering the overall performance of these modules. Our work thoroughly evaluates the performance of advanced core components in RAG systems, providing insights into optimizations for prevalent failure points.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-augmented reasoning mitigates this limitation by allowing LLMs to query external resources, but existing methods often retrieve irrelevant or noisy information, hindering accurate reasoning. In this paper, we propose AutoRefine, a reinforcement learning post-training framework that adopts a new ``search-and-refine-during-think'' paradigm. AutoRefine introduces explicit knowledge refinement steps between successive search calls, enabling the model to iteratively filter, distill, and organize evidence before generating an answer. Furthermore, we incorporate tailored retrieval-specific rewards alongside answer correctness rewards using group relative policy optimization. Experiments on single-hop and multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that AutoRefine significantly outperforms existing approaches, particularly in complex, multi-hop reasoning scenarios. Detailed analysis shows that AutoRefine issues frequent, higher-quality searches and synthesizes evidence effectively.</p></details> |  |

However, these models often exhibit limited effectiveness when applied to non-Western cultural contexts, which raises concerns about their wider applicability. To address this limitation, we propose the \textbf{T}raditional \textbf{C}hinese \textbf{C}ulture understanding \textbf{Bench}mark (\textbf{TCC-Bench}), a bilingual (\textit{i.e.}, Chinese and English) Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark specifically designed for assessing the understanding of traditional Chinese culture by MLLMs. TCC-Bench comprises culturally rich and visually diverse data, incorporating images from museum artifacts, everyday life scenes, comics, and other culturally significant contexts. We adopt a semi-automated pipeline that utilizes GPT-4o in text-only mode to generate candidate questions, followed by human curation to ensure data quality and avoid potential data leakage. The benchmark also avoids language bias by preventing direct disclosure of cultural concepts within question texts. Experimental evaluations across a wide range of MLLMs demonstrate that current models still face significant challenges when reasoning about culturally grounded visual content. The results highlight the need for further research in developing culturally inclusive and context-aware multimodal systems. The code and data can be found at: https://github.com/Morty-Xu/TCC-Bench.</p></details> | Preprint |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities, they still remain inadequate for multi-modal data analytics in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and freshness. First, current natural language (NL) or SQL-like query languages may struggle to precisely and comprehensively capture users' analytical intent. Second, relying on a single unified LLM to process diverse data modalities often leads to substantial inference overhead. Third, data stored in data lakes may be incomplete or outdated, making it essential to integrate external open-domain knowledge to generate timely and relevant analytics results. In this paper, we envision a new multi-modal data analytics system. Specifically, we propose a novel architecture built upon the Model Context Protocol (MCP), an emerging paradigm that enables LLMs to collaborate with knowledgeable agents. First, we define a semantic operator hierarchy tailored for querying multi-modal data in data lakes and develop an AI-agent-powered NL2Operator translator to bridge user intent and analytical execution. Next, we introduce an MCP-based execution framework, in which each MCP server hosts specialized foundation models optimized for specific data modalities. This design enhances both accuracy and efficiency, while supporting high scalability through modular deployment. Finally, we propose a updating mechanism by harnessing the deep research and machine unlearning techniques to refresh the data lakes and LLM knowledges, with the goal of balancing the data freshness and inference efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[ZeroSearch: Incentivize the Search Capability of LLMs without Searching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04588v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective information searching is essential for enhancing the reasoning and generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Recent research has explored using reinforcement learning (RL) to improve LLMs' search capabilities by interacting with live search engines in real-world environments. While these approaches show promising results, they face two major challenges: (1) Uncontrolled Document Quality: The quality of documents returned by search engines is often unpredictable, introducing noise and instability into the training process. (2) Prohibitively High API Costs: RL training requires frequent rollouts, potentially involving hundreds of thousands of search requests, which incur substantial API expenses and severely constrain scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce ZeroSearch, a novel RL framework that incentivizes the capabilities of LLMs to use a real search engine with simulated searches during training. Our approach begins with lightweight supervised fine-tuning to transform the LLM into a retrieval module capable of generating both useful and noisy documents in response to a query. During RL training, we employ a curriculum-based rollout strategy that incrementally degrades the quality of generated documents, progressively eliciting the model's reasoning ability by exposing it to increasingly challenging retrieval scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ZeroSearch effectively incentivizes the search capabilities of LLMs using a 3B LLM as the retrieval module. Remarkably, a 7B retrieval module achieves comparable performance to the real search engine, while a 14B retrieval module even surpasses it. Furthermore, it generalizes well across both base and instruction-tuned models of various parameter sizes and is compatible with a wide range of RL algorithms.</p></details> |  |

While these models are often employed for legitimate purposes, they are also used to generate fake images that support misinformation and hate speech. Consequently, it is crucial to develop robust tools capable of detecting whether an image has been generated by such models. Many current detection methods, however, require large volumes of sample images for training. Unfortunately, due to the rapid evolution of the field, existing datasets often cover only a limited range of models and quickly become outdated. In this work, we introduce DRAGON, a comprehensive dataset comprising images from 25 diffusion models, spanning both recent advancements and older, well-established architectures. The dataset contains a broad variety of images representing diverse subjects. To enhance image realism, we propose a simple yet effective pipeline that leverages a large language model to expand input prompts, thereby generating more diverse and higher-quality outputs, as evidenced by improvements in standard quality metrics. The dataset is provided in multiple sizes (ranging from extra-small to extra-large) to accomodate different research scenarios. DRAGON is designed to support the forensic community in developing and evaluating detection and attribution techniques for synthetic content. Additionally, the dataset is accompanied by a dedicated test set, intended to serve as a benchmark for assessing the performance of newly developed methods.</p></details> |  |

However, these safety-critical scenarios are rare and difficult to collect from real-world driving data, posing significant challenges to effectively assessing the performance of autonomous vehicles. Typical existing methods often suffer from limited controllability and lack user-friendliness, as extensive expert knowledge is essentially required. To address these challenges, we propose LD-Scene, a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) for user-controllable adversarial scenario generation through natural language. Our approach comprises an LDM that captures realistic driving trajectory distributions and an LLM-based guidance module that translates user queries into adversarial loss functions, facilitating the generation of scenarios aligned with user queries. The guidance module integrates an LLM-based Chain-of-Thought (CoT) code generator and an LLM-based code debugger, enhancing the controllability and robustness in generating guidance functions. Extensive experiments conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that LD-Scene achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic, diverse, and effective adversarial scenarios. Furthermore, our framework provides fine-grained control over adversarial behaviors, thereby facilitating more effective testing tailored to specific driving scenarios.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

While understanding linguistic metaphors has advanced significantly, grasping multimodal metaphors, such as those found in internet memes, presents unique challenges due to their unconventional expressions and implied meanings. Existing methods for multimodal metaphor identification often struggle to bridge the gap between literal and figurative interpretations. Additionally, generative approaches that utilize large language models or text-to-image models, while promising, suffer from high computational costs. This paper introduces \textbf{C}oncept \textbf{D}rift \textbf{G}uided \textbf{L}ayerNorm \textbf{T}uning (\textbf{CDGLT}), a novel and training-efficient framework for multimodal metaphor identification. CDGLT incorporates two key innovations: (1) Concept Drift, a mechanism that leverages Spherical Linear Interpolation (SLERP) of cross-modal embeddings from a CLIP encoder to generate a new, divergent concept embedding. This drifted concept helps to alleviate the gap between literal features and the figurative task. (2) A prompt construction strategy, that adapts the method of feature extraction and fusion using pre-trained language models for the multimodal metaphor identification task. CDGLT achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MET-Meme benchmark while significantly reducing training costs compared to existing generative methods. Ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of both Concept Drift and our adapted LN Tuning approach. Our method represents a significant step towards efficient and accurate multimodal metaphor understanding.

Current moderation efforts, reliant on classifiers trained with extensive human-annotated data, struggle with scalability and adapting to new forms of harm. To address these challenges, we propose a novel re-ranking approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) in zero-shot and few-shot settings. Our method dynamically assesses and re-ranks content sequences, effectively mitigating harmful content exposure without requiring extensive labeled data. Alongside traditional ranking metrics, we also introduce two new metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of re-ranking in reducing exposure to harmful content. Through experiments on three datasets, three models and across three configurations, we demonstrate that our LLM-based approach significantly outperforms existing proprietary moderation approaches, offering a scalable and adaptable solution for harm mitigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

Problem-Solving RL Implicitly Induces PRM Capability in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11227v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of reasoning capabilities represents a critical frontier in large language models (LLMs) research, where reinforcement learning (RL) and process reward models (PRMs) have emerged as predominant methodological frameworks. Contrary to conventional wisdom, empirical evidence from DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates that pure RL training focused on mathematical problem-solving can progressively enhance reasoning abilities without PRM integration, challenging the perceived necessity of process supervision. In this study, we conduct a systematic investigation of the relationship between RL training and PRM capabilities. Our findings demonstrate that problem-solving proficiency and process supervision capabilities represent complementary dimensions of reasoning that co-evolve synergistically during pure RL training. In particular, current PRMs underperform simple baselines like majority voting when applied to state-of-the-art models such as DeepSeek-R1 and QwQ-32B. To address this limitation, we propose Self-PRM, an introspective framework in which models autonomously evaluate and rerank their generated solutions through self-reward mechanisms. Although Self-PRM consistently improves the accuracy of the benchmark (particularly with larger sample sizes), analysis exposes persistent challenges: The approach exhibits low precision (<10\%) on difficult problems, frequently misclassifying flawed solutions as valid. These analyses underscore the need for continued RL scaling to improve reward alignment and introspective accuracy. Overall, our findings suggest that PRM may not be essential for enhancing complex reasoning, as pure RL not only improves problem-solving skills but also inherently fosters robust PRM capabilities. We hope these findings provide actionable insights for building more reliable and self-aware complex reasoning models.</p></details> |  |
| **[HAPO: Training Language Models to Reason Concisely via History-Aware Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11225v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While scaling the length of responses at test-time has been shown to markedly improve the reasoning abilities and performance of large language models (LLMs), it often results in verbose outputs and increases inference cost. Prior approaches for efficient test-time scaling, typically using universal budget constraints or query-level length optimization, do not leverage historical information from previous encounters with the same problem during training. We hypothesize that this limits their ability to progressively make solutions more concise over time. To address this, we present History-Aware Policy Optimization (HAPO), which keeps track of a history state (e.g., the minimum length over previously generated correct responses) for each problem. HAPO employs a novel length reward function based on this history state to incentivize the discovery of correct solutions that are more concise than those previously found. Crucially, this reward structure avoids overly penalizing shorter incorrect responses with the goal of facilitating exploration towards more efficient solutions. By combining this length reward with a correctness reward, HAPO jointly optimizes for correctness and efficiency. We use HAPO to train DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview, and Qwen-2.5-1.5B-Instruct, and evaluate HAPO on several math benchmarks that span various difficulty levels. Experiment results demonstrate that HAPO effectively induces LLMs' concise reasoning abilities, producing length reductions of 33-59% with accuracy drops of only 2-5%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Adapting Open-Source Large Language Models for Expert-Level Clinical Note Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00715v5)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Gemini have demonstrated promising capabilities in clinical text summarization tasks. However, due to patient data privacy concerns and computational costs, many healthcare providers prefer using small, locally-hosted models over external generic LLMs. This study presents a comprehensive domain- and task-specific adaptation process for the open-source LLaMA-2 13 billion parameter model, enabling it to generate high-quality clinical notes from outpatient patient-doctor dialogues. Our process incorporates continued pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning from both AI and human feedback. We introduced a new approach, DistillDirect, for performing on-policy reinforcement learning with Gemini 1.0 Pro as the teacher model. Our resulting model, LLaMA-Clinic, can generate clinical notes comparable in quality to those authored by physicians. In a blinded physician reader study, the majority (90.4%) of individual evaluations rated the notes generated by LLaMA-Clinic as "acceptable" or higher across all three criteria: real-world readiness, completeness, and accuracy. In the more challenging "Assessment and Plan" section, LLaMA-Clinic scored higher (4.2/5) in real-world readiness than physician-authored notes (4.1/5). We highlight key considerations for future clinical note-generation tasks, emphasizing the importance of pre-defining a best-practice note format, rather than relying on LLMs to determine this for clinical practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can We Trust AI Agents? A Case Study of an LLM-Based Multi-Agent System for Ethical AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08881v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI-based systems, including Large Language Models (LLM), impact millions by supporting diverse tasks but face issues like misinformation, bias, and misuse. AI ethics is crucial as new technologies and concerns emerge, but objective, practical guidance remains debated. This study examines the use of LLMs for AI ethics in practice, assessing how LLM trustworthiness-enhancing techniques affect software development in this context. Using the Design Science Research (DSR) method, we identify techniques for LLM trustworthiness: multi-agents, distinct roles, structured communication, and multiple rounds of debate. We design a multi-agent prototype LLM-MAS, where agents engage in structured discussions on real-world AI ethics issues from the AI Incident Database. We evaluate the prototype across three case scenarios using thematic analysis, hierarchical clustering, comparative (baseline) studies, and running source code. The system generates approximately 2,000 lines of code per case, compared to only 80 lines in baseline trials. Discussions reveal terms like bias detection, transparency, accountability, user consent, GDPR compliance, fairness evaluation, and EU AI Act compliance, showing this prototype ability to generate extensive source code and documentation addressing often overlooked AI ethics issues. However, practical challenges in source code integration and dependency management may limit its use by practitioners.</p></details> |  |

Although the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) remains the standard for TTS System evaluation, it suffers from subjectivity, environmental inconsistencies, and limited interpretability. Existing evaluation datasets also lack a multi-dimensional design, often neglecting factors such as speaking styles, context diversity, and trap utterances, which is particularly evident in Chinese TTS evaluation. To address these challenges, we introduce the Audio Turing Test (ATT), a multi-dimensional Chinese corpus dataset ATT-Corpus paired with a simple, Turing-Test-inspired evaluation protocol. Instead of relying on complex MOS scales or direct model comparisons, ATT asks evaluators to judge whether a voice sounds human. This simplification reduces rating bias and improves evaluation robustness. To further support rapid model development, we also finetune Qwen2-Audio-Instruct with human judgment data as Auto-ATT for automatic evaluation. Experimental results show that ATT effectively differentiates models across specific capability dimensions using its multi-dimensional design. Auto-ATT also demonstrates strong alignment with human evaluations, confirming its value as a fast and reliable assessment tool. The white-box ATT-Corpus and Auto-ATT can be found in ATT Hugging Face Collection (https://huggingface.co/collections/meituan/audio-turing-test-682446320368164faeaf38a4).</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Can Global XAI Methods Reveal Injected Bias in LLMs? SHAP vs Rule Extraction vs RuleSHAP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11189v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI systems can help spread information but also misinformation and biases, potentially undermining the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Explainable AI (XAI) aims to reveal the inner workings of AI systems and expose misbehaviours or biases. However, current XAI tools, built for simpler models, struggle to handle the non-numerical nature of large language models (LLMs). This paper examines the effectiveness of global XAI methods, such as rule-extraction algorithms and SHAP, in detecting bias in LLMs. To do so, we first show a text-to-ordinal mapping strategy to convert non-numerical inputs/outputs into numerical features, enabling these tools to identify (some) misinformation-related biases in LLM-generated content. Then, we inject non-linear biases of varying complexity (univariate, conjunctive, and non-convex) into widespread LLMs like ChatGPT and Llama via system instructions, using global XAI methods to detect them. This way, we found that RuleFit struggles with conjunctive and non-convex biases, while SHAP can approximate conjunctive biases but cannot express them as actionable rules. Hence, we introduce RuleSHAP, a global rule extraction algorithm combining SHAP and RuleFit to detect more non-univariate biases, improving injected bias detection over RuleFit by +94% (MRR@1) on average.</p></details> |  |
| **[KVShare: An LLM Service System with Efficient and Effective Multi-Tenant KV Cache Reuse](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16525v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in long-text understanding have pushed the context length of large language models (LLMs) up to one million tokens. It boosts LLMs's accuracy and reasoning capacity but causes exorbitant computational costs and unsatisfactory Time to First Token (TTFT). KV cache reuse, which reuses the exact same KV cache of prefixes and templates or shares similar ones but with extra selective recomputation, offers a promising way to tackle this issue. However, prior studies overlook the cross-request KV reuse and the attention deviations introduced by new tokens during the decoding stage. In this paper, we present a KV cache management module that shares the KV cache across requests under multi-tenant scenarios without sacrificing model accuracy. Our system, KVShare, enables accurate and efficient LLM serving by 1) a Dual-Stage High Deviation algorithm (DHD) that conditionally selects a small portion of KV cache to be recomputed during both prefill and decode phases, and 2) a cache-aware scheduler that prioritizes requests based on their KV cache hit rates and orchestrates continuous batching to achieve enhanced system efficiency and faster TTFT. Multi-task experiments conducted on models such as Qwen2.5-7B,Llama3.1-8B and Yi1.5-9B demonstrate that KVShare reduces TTFT by up to 9.39x and increases 1.2x of the throughput compared to the full KV recompute. Moreover, KVShare achieves 20.38% boost in terms of accuracy compared to SOTA methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Next-Token Prediction in LLMs: How End Goals Determine the Consistency of Decoding Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11183v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic next-token prediction trained using cross-entropy loss is the basis of most large language models. Given a sequence of previous values, next-token prediction assigns a probability to each possible next value in the vocabulary. There are many ways to use next-token prediction to output token sequences. This paper examines a few of these algorithms (greedy, lookahead, random sampling, and temperature-scaled random sampling) and studies their consistency with respect to various goals encoded as loss functions. Although consistency of surrogate losses with respect to a target loss function is a well researched topic, we are the first to study it in the context of LLMs (to the best of our knowledge). We find that, so long as next-token prediction converges to its true probability distribution, random sampling is consistent with outputting sequences that mimic sampling from the true probability distribution. For the other goals, such as minimizing the 0-1 loss on the entire sequence, we show no polynomial-time algorithm is optimal for all probability distributions and all decoding algorithms studied are only optimal for a subset of probability distributions. When analyzing these results, we see that there is a dichotomy created between the goals of information retrieval and creative generation for the decoding algorithms. This shows that choosing the correct decoding algorithm based on the desired goal is extremely important and many of the ones used are lacking theoretical grounding in numerous scenarios.</p></details> | 23 pages |

In Open-World Compositional Zero-Shot Learning, when all possible state-object combinations are considered as unseen classes, zero-shot predictors tend to perform poorly. Our work focuses on using external auxiliary knowledge to determine the feasibility of state-object combinations. Our Feasibility with Language Model (FLM) is a simple and effective approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to better comprehend the semantic relationships between states and objects. FLM involves querying an LLM about the feasibility of a given pair and retrieving the output logit for the positive answer. To mitigate potential misguidance of the LLM given that many of the state-object compositions are rare or completely infeasible, we observe that the in-context learning ability of LLMs is essential. We present an extensive study identifying Vicuna and ChatGPT as best performing, and we demonstrate that our FLM consistently improves OW-CZSL performance across all three benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV Workshop in OOD-CV, 2024</p></details> |

Existing methods evict tokens based on their positions or importance scores, but position-based strategies can miss crucial information outside predefined regions, while those relying on global importance scores resulting in strong regional biases, limiting the KV cache's overall context retention and potentially impairing the performance of LLMs on complex tasks. Our wavelet analysis reveals that as tokens approach the end of sequence, their contributions to generation gradually increase and tends to diverge more from neighboring tokens, indicating a smooth transition with increasing complexity and variability from distant to nearby context. Motivated by this observation, we propose TreeKV, an intuitive, training-free method that employs a tree structure for smooth cache compression. TreeKV maintains a fixed cache size, allowing LLMs to deliver high-quality output even in long text scenarios. Unlike most compression methods, TreeKV is applicable to both the generation and prefilling stages. TreeKV consistently surpasses all baseline models in language modeling tasks on PG19 and OpenWebText2, allowing LLMs trained with short context window to generalize to longer window with a 16x cache reduction. On the Longbench benchmark, TreeKV achieves the best performance with only 6\% of the budget at optimal efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, existing RAG evaluation predominantly focuses on text retrieval and relies on opaque, end-to-end assessments of generated outputs. To address these limitations, we introduce mmRAG, a modular benchmark designed for evaluating multi-modal RAG systems. Our benchmark integrates queries from six diverse question-answering datasets spanning text, tables, and knowledge graphs, which we uniformly convert into retrievable documents. To enable direct, granular evaluation of individual RAG components -- such as the accuracy of retrieval and query routing -- beyond end-to-end generation quality, we follow standard information retrieval procedures to annotate document relevance and derive dataset relevance. We establish baseline performance by evaluating a wide range of RAG implementations on mmRAG.</p></details> |  |

This paper explores Augmented Object Intelligence (AOI) in the context of XR, an interaction paradigm that aims to blur the lines between digital and physical by equipping real-world objects with the ability to interact as if they were digital, where every object has the potential to serve as a portal to digital functionalities. Our approach utilizes real-time object segmentation and classification, combined with the power of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), to facilitate these interactions without the need for object pre-registration. We implement the AOI concept in the form of XR-Objects, an open-source prototype system that provides a platform for users to engage with their physical environment in contextually relevant ways using object-based context menus. This system enables analog objects to not only convey information but also to initiate digital actions, such as querying for details or executing tasks. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we define the AOI concept and detail its advantages over traditional AI assistants, (2) detail the XR-Objects system's open-source design and implementation, and (3) show its versatility through various use cases and a user study.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 15 figures, 2024 ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST)</p></details> |

However, existing static image-text benchmarks are insufficient for evaluating their dynamic perception and interactive reasoning abilities. We introduce Vision-centric Multiple Abilities Game Evaluation(V-MAGE), a novel game-based evaluation framework designed to systematically assess MLLMs' visual reasoning in interactive, continuous-space environments. V-MAGE features five distinct video games comprising over 30 carefully constructed evaluation scenarios. These scenarios are set in free-form, visually complex environments that require models to interpret dynamic game states and make decisions based solely on visual input, thereby closely reflecting the conditions encountered by human players. To ensure robust and interpretable comparisons across models, V-MAGE employs a dynamic Elo-based ranking system that accounts for varying difficulty levels and task diversity. Benchmarking state-of-the-art MLLMs against human baselines reveals that while leading models approach human-level performance in simple tasks, their performance drops significantly in complex scenarios requiring advanced reasoning and task orchestration. This persistent performance gap highlights fundamental limitations in current MLLMs' ability to perform real-time, vision-grounded interactions. Through extensive analyses, we demonstrate the utility of V-MAGE in uncovering these limitations and providing actionable insights for improving the visual and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs in dynamic, interactive settings. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/CSU-JPG/V-MAGE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Balancing LoRA Performance and Efficiency with Simple Shard Sharing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15371v9)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, particularly Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), effectively reduce the number of trainable parameters in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, as model scales continue to grow, the demand for computational resources remains a significant challenge. Existing LoRA variants often struggle to strike an optimal balance between adaptability (model performance and convergence speed) and efficiency (computational overhead, memory usage, and initialization time). This paper introduces FOSSIL(\textbf{F}ramework for \textbf{O}ptimal \textbf{S}hard \textbf{S}haring \textbf{I}ntegration in \textbf{L}oRA), a novel PEFT approach that addresses this trade-off through a simple shard-sharing mechanism. FOSSIL leverages the insight that a low-rank adaptation can be achieved by decomposing the weight matrix into multiple fragment matrices and utilizing a shared, trainable common fragment. This method constructs the low-rank update matrix through the replication of these shared, partitioned shards. We also propose a hardware-efficient and broadly applicable implementation for FOSSIL. Extensive experiments conducted on a range of tasks, alongside a systematic analysis of computational performance, demonstrate FOSSIL's superiority. The results show that FOSSIL significantly outperforms standard LoRA and its prominent variants in both model performance metrics and computational efficiency, including initialization speed and training throughput. By effectively balancing expressive power and resource utilization, FOSSIL offers a compelling solution for efficiently adapting large-scale models.</p></details> |  |

Traditional modeling approaches, such as rule-based Agent-Based Models (ABMs), struggle to capture the diversity and complexity of human behavior, particularly the irrational factors emphasized in behavioral economics. Recently, large language model (LLM) agents have gained traction as simulation tools for modeling human behavior in social science and role-playing applications. Studies suggest that LLMs can account for cognitive biases, emotional fluctuations, and other non-rational influences, enabling more realistic simulations of socio-economic dynamics. In this work, we introduce TwinMarket, a novel multi-agent framework that leverages LLMs to simulate socio-economic systems. Specifically, we examine how individual behaviors, through interactions and feedback mechanisms, give rise to collective dynamics and emergent phenomena. Through experiments in a simulated stock market environment, we demonstrate how individual actions can trigger group behaviors, leading to emergent outcomes such as financial bubbles and recessions. Our approach provides valuable insights into the complex interplay between individual decision-making and collective socio-economic patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gaussian Weight Sampling for Scalable, Efficient and Stable Pseudo-Quantization Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11170v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ever-growing scale of large language models (LLMs) is pushing for improved efficiency, favoring fully quantized training (FQT) over BF16. While FQT accelerates training, it faces consistency challenges and requires searching over an exponential number of cases, each needing over 200B tokens to ensure stability. Pseudo-quantization training (PQT) addresses the issues of FQT, although it is not well-studied. We explore the practical implications of PQT in detail and propose a noise distribution $R$ that is floating-point (FP)-friendly, with ideal properties including stochastic precision annealing. As a result, the proposed method serves as an effective theoretical foundation for low-precision FP parameters through PQT, utilizing efficient fake quantization via an addition and subsequent FP casting. We demonstrate that Gaussian weight sampling is (1) scalable: supports low-precision FP parameters down to FP6 and high-precision noise up to 9-bit with BF16 operator. The proposed method is (2) efficient: incurring computational overhead as low as 1.40\% on the A100 GPU in terms of Llama2 training tokens per second, and requiring 2 bytes per parameter in GPU memory. We demonstrate that PQT with Gaussian weight sampling is (3) stable: closely following or even surpassing performance of the BF16 baseline while pre-training GPT2 and Llama2 models with up to 1B parameters and 300B tokens.</p></details> |  |
| **[SoLoPO: Unlocking Long-Context Capabilities in LLMs via Short-to-Long Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11166v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite advances in pretraining with extended context lengths, large language models (LLMs) still face challenges in effectively utilizing real-world long-context information, primarily due to insufficient long-context alignment caused by data quality issues, training inefficiencies, and the lack of well-designed optimization objectives. To address these limitations, we propose a framework named $\textbf{S}$h$\textbf{o}$rt-to-$\textbf{Lo}$ng $\textbf{P}$reference $\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{SoLoPO}$), decoupling long-context preference optimization (PO) into two components: short-context PO and short-to-long reward alignment (SoLo-RA), supported by both theoretical and empirical evidence. Specifically, short-context PO leverages preference pairs sampled from short contexts to enhance the model's contextual knowledge utilization ability. Meanwhile, SoLo-RA explicitly encourages reward score consistency utilization for the responses when conditioned on both short and long contexts that contain identical task-relevant information. This facilitates transferring the model's ability to handle short contexts into long-context scenarios. SoLoPO is compatible with mainstream preference optimization algorithms, while substantially improving the efficiency of data construction and training processes. Experimental results show that SoLoPO enhances all these algorithms with respect to stronger length and domain generalization abilities across various long-context benchmarks, while achieving notable improvements in both computational and memory efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Relative Overfitting and Accept-Reject Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07783v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Currently, the scaling law of Large Language Models (LLMs) faces challenges and bottlenecks. This paper posits that noise effects, stemming from changes in the signal-to-noise ratio under diminishing marginal returns, are the root cause of these issues. To control this noise, we investigated the differences between models with performance advantages and disadvantages, introducing the concept of "relative overfitting." Based on their complementary strengths, we have proposed an application framework, Accept-Reject (AR). In Natural Language Processing (NLP), we use LLMs and Small Language Models (SLMs) as the medium for discussion. This framework enables SLMs to exert a universal positive influence on LLM decision outputs, rather than the intuitively expected negative influence. We validated our approach using self-built models based on mainstream architectures and pre-trained mainstream models across multiple datasets, including basic language modeling, long-context tasks, subject examination, and question-answering (QA) benchmarks. The results demonstrate that through our structure, compared to increasing the LLM's parameters, we can achieve better performance improvements with significantly lower parameter and computational costs in many scenarios. These improvements are universal, stable, and effective. Furthermore, we explore the potential of "relative overfitting" and the AR framework in other machine learning domains, such as computer vision (CV) and AI for science. We hope the proposed approach can help scale laws overcome existing bottlenecks.</p></details> |  |

Despite the significant user base and capital flows in Web3, encompassing smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), on-chain governance, and novel token-economics, no comprehensive benchmark has systematically assessed LLM performance in this domain. To address this gap, we introduce the DMind Benchmark, a holistic Web3-oriented evaluation suite covering nine critical subfields: fundamental blockchain concepts, blockchain infrastructure, smart contract, DeFi mechanisms, DAOs, NFTs, token economics, meme concept, and security vulnerabilities. Beyond multiple-choice questions, DMind Benchmark features domain-specific tasks such as contract debugging and on-chain numeric reasoning, mirroring real-world scenarios. We evaluated 26 models, including ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok, and Qwen, uncovering notable performance gaps in specialized areas like token economics and security-critical contract analysis. While some models excel in blockchain infrastructure tasks, advanced subfields remain challenging.

However, as the MCP is increasingly adopted, third-party customized versions of the MCP server expose potential security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we first introduce a novel security threat, which we term the MCP Preference Manipulation Attack (MPMA). An attacker deploys a customized MCP server to manipulate LLMs, causing them to prioritize it over other competing MCP servers. This can result in economic benefits for attackers, such as revenue from paid MCP services or advertising income generated from free servers. To achieve MPMA, we first design a Direct Preference Manipulation Attack ($\mathtt{DPMA}$) that achieves significant effectiveness by inserting the manipulative word and phrases into the tool name and description. However, such a direct modification is obvious to users and lacks stealthiness. To address these limitations, we further propose Genetic-based Advertising Preference Manipulation Attack ($\mathtt{GAPMA}$). $\mathtt{GAPMA}$ employs four commonly used strategies to initialize descriptions and integrates a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to enhance stealthiness. The experiment results demonstrate that $\mathtt{GAPMA}$ balances high effectiveness and stealthiness. Our study reveals a critical vulnerability of the MCP in open ecosystems, highlighting an urgent need for robust defense mechanisms to ensure the fairness of the MCP ecosystem.</p></details> |  |

However, existing datasets are limited in size and diversity, making it difficult to study such vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce SCAM, the largest and most diverse dataset of real-world typographic attack images to date, containing 1,162 images across hundreds of object categories and attack words. Through extensive benchmarking of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on SCAM, we demonstrate that typographic attacks significantly degrade performance, and identify that training data and model architecture influence the susceptibility to these attacks. Our findings reveal that typographic attacks persist in state-of-the-art Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) due to the choice of their vision encoder, though larger Large Language Models (LLMs) backbones help mitigate their vulnerability. Additionally, we demonstrate that synthetic attacks closely resemble real-world (handwritten) attacks, validating their use in research. Our work provides a comprehensive resource and empirical insights to facilitate future research toward robust and trustworthy multimodal AI systems.

| **[Human-Aligned Bench: Fine-Grained Assessment of Reasoning Ability in MLLMs vs. Humans](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11141v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is to imitate humans and surpass them. Models such as OpenAI's o1, o3, and DeepSeek's R1 have demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) with human-like reasoning capabilities exhibit exceptional performance and are being gradually integrated into multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, whether these models possess capabilities comparable to humans in handling reasoning tasks remains unclear at present. In this paper, we propose Human-Aligned Bench, a benchmark for fine-grained alignment of multimodal reasoning with human performance. Specifically, we collected 9,794 multimodal questions that solely rely on contextual reasoning, including bilingual (Chinese and English) multimodal questions and pure text-based questions, encompassing four question types: visual reasoning, definition judgment, analogical reasoning, and logical judgment. More importantly, each question is accompanied by human success rates and options that humans are prone to choosing incorrectly. Extensive experiments on the Human-Aligned Bench reveal notable differences between the performance of current MLLMs in multimodal reasoning and human performance. The findings on our benchmark provide insights into the development of the next-generation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Reasoning can Improve Factuality in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11140v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies on large language model (LLM) reasoning capabilities have demonstrated promising improvements in model performance by leveraging a lengthy thinking process and additional computational resources during inference, primarily in tasks involving mathematical reasoning (Muennighoff et al., 2025). However, it remains uncertain if longer reasoning chains inherently enhance factual accuracy, particularly beyond mathematical contexts. In this work, we thoroughly examine LLM reasoning within complex open-domain question-answering (QA) scenarios. We initially distill reasoning traces from advanced, large-scale reasoning models (QwQ-32B and DeepSeek-R1-671B), then fine-tune a variety of models ranging from smaller, instruction-tuned variants to larger architectures based on Qwen2.5. To enrich reasoning traces, we introduce factual information from knowledge graphs in the form of paths into our reasoning traces. Our experimental setup includes four baseline approaches and six different instruction-tuned models evaluated across a benchmark of six datasets, encompassing over 22.6K questions. Overall, we carry out 168 experimental runs and analyze approximately 1.7 million reasoning traces. Our findings indicate that, within a single run, smaller reasoning models achieve noticeable improvements in factual accuracy compared to their original instruction-tuned counterparts. Moreover, our analysis demonstrates that adding test-time compute and token budgets factual accuracy consistently improves by 2-8%, further confirming the effectiveness of test-time scaling for enhancing performance and consequently improving reasoning accuracy in open-domain QA tasks.

While traditional formulaic alpha mining relies on human expertise, contemporary automated methods, such as those based on genetic programming or reinforcement learning, often suffer from search inefficiency or yield poorly interpretable alpha factors. This paper introduces a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to overcome these limitations. Our approach leverages the LLM's instruction-following and reasoning capability to iteratively generate and refine symbolic alpha formulas within an MCTS-driven exploration. A key innovation is the guidance of MCTS exploration by rich, quantitative feedback from financial backtesting of each candidate factor, enabling efficient navigation of the vast search space. Furthermore, a frequent subtree avoidance mechanism is introduced to bolster search efficiency and alpha factor performance. Experimental results on real-world stock market data demonstrate that our LLM-based framework outperforms existing methods by mining alphas with superior predictive accuracy, trading performance, and improved interpretability, while offering a more efficient solution for formulaic alpha mining.</p></details> | 30 pages |

However, challenges such as high computational and memory demands, heterogeneous client resources, bandwidth constraints, and ineffective global aggregation hinder its efficiency. To address these issues, we propose HAFLQ (Heterogeneous Adaptive Federated Low-Rank Adaptation Fine-tuned LLM with Quantization), a novel framework for efficient and scalable federated fine-tuning of LLMs in heterogeneous environments. To reduce memory and computation demands, we propose a salience-driven adaptive LLM quantization framework that evaluates the importance of transformer blocks using a salience metric and applies adaptive block-wise quantization accordingly. To handle heterogeneous computational capabilities, we propose an importance-based parameter truncation and freezing scheme. To address communication bottlenecks, we propose an importance-aware bandwidth-adaptive quantization method, which dynamically adjusts parameter precision based on importance and bandwidth constraints. To improve global model aggregation, we propose an adaptive rank-1 matrix-level aggregation strategy, which prevents information dilution and accelerates convergence by aggregating only updated rank-1 matrices from clients. Experimental results on the text classification task demonstrate that HAFLQ reduces memory usage by 31%, lowers communication cost by 49%, improves accuracy by 50%, and achieves faster convergence compared to the baseline method.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an extended journal version based on our previous conference paper accepted at the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC), with additional sections and new results</p></details> |
| **[Group Think: Multiple Concurrent Reasoning Agents Collaborating at Token Level Granularity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11107v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the power of reasoning through self-generated chains of thought. Multiple reasoning agents can collaborate to raise joint reasoning quality above individual outcomes. However, such agents typically interact in a turn-based manner, trading increased latency for improved quality. In this paper, we propose Group Think--a single LLM that acts as multiple concurrent reasoning agents, or thinkers. With shared visibility into each other's partial generation progress, Group Think introduces a new concurrent-reasoning paradigm in which multiple reasoning trajectories adapt dynamically to one another at the token level. For example, a reasoning thread may shift its generation mid-sentence upon detecting that another thread is better positioned to continue. This fine-grained, token-level collaboration enables Group Think to reduce redundant reasoning and improve quality while achieving significantly lower latency. Moreover, its concurrent nature allows for efficient utilization of idle computational resources, making it especially suitable for edge inference, where very small batch size often underutilizes local~GPUs. We give a simple and generalizable modification that enables any existing LLM to perform Group Think on a local GPU. We also present an evaluation strategy to benchmark reasoning latency and empirically demonstrate latency improvements using open-source LLMs that were not explicitly trained for Group Think. We hope this work paves the way for future LLMs to exhibit more sophisticated and more efficient collaborative behavior for higher quality generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Better Evaluation for Generated Patent Claims](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11095v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Patent claims define the scope of protection and establish the legal boundaries of an invention. Drafting these claims is a complex and time-consuming process that usually requires the expertise of skilled patent attorneys, which can form a large access barrier for many small enterprises. To solve these challenges, researchers have investigated the use of large language models (LLMs) for automating patent claim generation. However, existing studies highlight inconsistencies between automated evaluation metrics and human expert assessments. To bridge this gap, we introduce Patent-CE, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating patent claims. Patent-CE includes comparative claim evaluations annotated by patent experts, focusing on five key criteria: feature completeness, conceptual clarity, terminology consistency, logical linkage, and overall quality. Additionally, we propose PatClaimEval, a novel multi-dimensional evaluation method specifically designed for patent claims. Our experiments demonstrate that PatClaimEval achieves the highest correlation with human expert evaluations across all assessment criteria among all tested metrics. This research provides the groundwork for more accurate evaluations of automated patent claim generation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025. 14 pages, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[Unveiling Attractor Cycles in Large Language Models: A Dynamical Systems View of Successive Paraphrasing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15208v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamical systems theory provides a framework for analyzing iterative processes and evolution over time. Within such systems, repetitive transformations can lead to stable configurations, known as attractors, including fixed points and limit cycles. Applying this perspective to large language models (LLMs), which iteratively map input text to output text, provides a principled approach to characterizing long-term behaviors. Successive paraphrasing serves as a compelling testbed for exploring such dynamics, as paraphrases re-express the same underlying meaning with linguistic variation. Although LLMs are expected to explore a diverse set of paraphrases in the text space, our study reveals that successive paraphrasing converges to stable periodic states, such as 2-period attractor cycles, limiting linguistic diversity. This phenomenon is attributed to the self-reinforcing nature of LLMs, as they iteratively favour and amplify certain textual forms over others. This pattern persists with increasing generation randomness or alternating prompts and LLMs. These findings underscore inherent constraints in LLM generative capability, while offering a novel dynamical systems perspective for studying their expressive potential.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[ShiQ: Bringing back Bellman to LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11081v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The fine-tuning of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) using reinforcement learning (RL) is generally formulated as direct policy optimization. This approach was naturally favored as it efficiently improves a pretrained LLM, seen as an initial policy. Another RL paradigm, Q-learning methods, has received far less attention in the LLM community while demonstrating major success in various non-LLM RL tasks. In particular, Q-learning effectiveness comes from its sample efficiency and ability to learn offline, which is particularly valuable given the high computational cost of sampling with LLMs. However, naively applying a Q-learning-style update to the model's logits is ineffective due to the specificity of LLMs. Our core contribution is to derive theoretically grounded loss functions from Bellman equations to adapt Q-learning methods to LLMs. To do so, we carefully adapt insights from the RL literature to account for LLM-specific characteristics, ensuring that the logits become reliable Q-value estimates. We then use this loss to build a practical algorithm, ShiQ for Shifted-Q, that supports off-policy, token-wise learning while remaining simple to implement. Finally, we evaluate ShiQ on both synthetic data and real-world benchmarks, e.g., UltraFeedback and BFCL-V3, demonstrating its effectiveness in both single-turn and multi-turn LLM settings</p></details> |  |

Given that audio large language models (ALLMs) have made significant progress in various audio processing tasks, a heuristic question arises: Can ALLMs be leveraged to solve ADD?. In this paper, we first conduct a comprehensive zero-shot evaluation of ALLMs on ADD, revealing their ineffectiveness in detecting fake audio. To enhance their performance, we propose $\mathcal{A}LLM4ADD$, an ALLM-driven framework for ADD. Specifically, we reformulate ADD task as an audio question answering problem, prompting the model with the question: "Is this audio fake or real?". We then perform supervised fine-tuning to enable the ALLM to assess the authenticity of query audio. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that our ALLM-based method can achieve superior performance in fake audio detection, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. As a pioneering study, we anticipate that this work will inspire the research community to leverage ALLMs to develop more effective ADD systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Enhanced Symbolic Control for Safety-Critical Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11077v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by Smart Manufacturing and Industry 4.0, we introduce a framework for synthesizing Abstraction-Based Controller Design (ABCD) for reach-avoid problems from Natural Language (NL) specifications using Large Language Models (LLMs). A Code Agent interprets an NL description of the control problem and translates it into a formal language interpretable by state-of-the-art symbolic control software, while a Checker Agent verifies the correctness of the generated code and enhances safety by identifying specification mismatches. Evaluations show that the system handles linguistic variability and improves robustness over direct planning with LLMs. The proposed approach lowers the barrier to formal control synthesis by enabling intuitive, NL-based task definition while maintaining safety guarantees through automated validation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Addition is almost all you need: Compressing neural networks with double binary factorization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11076v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binary quantization approaches, which replace weight matrices with binary matrices and substitute costly multiplications with cheaper additions, offer a computationally efficient approach to address the increasing computational and storage requirements of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the severe quantization constraint ($\pm1$) can lead to significant accuracy degradation. In this paper, we propose Double Binary Factorization (DBF), a novel method that factorizes dense weight matrices into products of two binary (sign) matrices, each accompanied by scaling vectors. DBF preserves the efficiency advantages of binary representations while achieving compression rates that are competitive with or superior to state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, in a 1-bit per weight range, DBF is better than existing binarization approaches. In a 2-bit per weight range, DBF is competitive with the best quantization methods like QuIP\# and QTIP. Unlike most existing compression techniques, which offer limited compression level choices, DBF allows fine-grained control over compression ratios by adjusting the factorization's intermediate dimension. Based on this advantage, we further introduce an algorithm for estimating non-uniform layer-wise compression ratios for DBF, based on previously developed channel pruning criteria.

In this work, we explore the strategic behaviors of large language models (LLMs) when deployed as autonomous agents in multi-commodity markets, specifically within Cournot competition frameworks. We examine whether LLMs can independently engage in anti-competitive practices such as collusion or, more specifically, market division. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can effectively monopolize specific commodities by dynamically adjusting their pricing and resource allocation strategies, thereby maximizing profitability without direct human input or explicit collusion commands. These results pose unique challenges and opportunities for businesses looking to integrate AI into strategic roles and for regulatory bodies tasked with maintaining fair and competitive markets. The study provides a foundation for further exploration into the ramifications of deferring high-stakes decisions to LLM-based agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time Travel is Cheating: Going Live with DeepFund for Real-Time Fund Investment Benchmarking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11065v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable capabilities across financial tasks, including financial report summarization, earnings call transcript analysis, and asset classification. However, their real-world effectiveness in managing complex fund investment remains inadequately assessed. A fundamental limitation of existing benchmarks for evaluating LLM-driven trading strategies is their reliance on historical back-testing, inadvertently enabling LLMs to "time travel"-leveraging future information embedded in their training corpora, thus resulting in possible information leakage and overly optimistic performance estimates. To address this issue, we introduce DeepFund, a live fund benchmark tool designed to rigorously evaluate LLM in real-time market conditions. Utilizing a multi-agent architecture, DeepFund connects directly with real-time stock market data-specifically data published after each model pretraining cutoff-to ensure fair and leakage-free evaluations. Empirical tests on nine flagship LLMs from leading global institutions across multiple investment dimensions-including ticker-level analysis, investment decision-making, portfolio management, and risk control-reveal significant practical challenges. Notably, even cutting-edge models such as DeepSeek-V3 and Claude-3.7-Sonnet incur net trading losses within DeepFund real-time evaluation environment, underscoring the present limitations of LLMs for active fund management.

However, recent progress in this area is saturating, underscoring the need to revisit its core limitations and explore further improvements. We address this challenge by identifying a key limitation of existing layer-wise PTQ methods: the growth of quantization errors across layers significantly degrades performance, particularly in low-bit regimes. To address this fundamental issue, we propose Quantization Error Propagation (QEP), a general, lightweight, and scalable framework that enhances layer-wise PTQ by explicitly propagating quantization errors and compensating for accumulated errors. QEP also offers a tunable propagation mechanism that prevents overfitting and controls computational overhead, enabling the framework to adapt to various architectures and resource budgets. Extensive experiments on several LLMs demonstrate that QEP-enhanced layer-wise PTQ achieves substantially higher accuracy than existing methods. Notably, the gains are most pronounced in the extremely low-bit quantization regime.</p></details> | 28 pages, 3 figures |

As the size of the model and data grows, the KV cache can quickly become a bottleneck within the system in both storage and memory transfer. To address this, prior studies usually focus on the first three axes of the cache tensors for compression. This paper supplements them, focusing on the feature dimension axis, by utilizing low-rank projection matrices to transform the cache features into spaces with reduced dimensions. We begin by investigating the canonical orthogonal projection method for data compression through principal component analysis (PCA). We observe the issue with PCA projection where significant performance degradation is observed at low compression rates. To bridge the gap, we propose to directly tune the orthogonal projection matrices with a distillation objective using an elaborate Matryoshka training strategy. After training, we adaptively search for the optimal compression rates for various layers and heads given varying compression budgets. Compared to previous works, our method can easily embrace pre-trained LLMs and hold a smooth tradeoff between performance and compression rate. We empirically witness the high data efficiency of our training procedure and find that our method can sustain over 90% performance with an average KV cache compression rate of 60% (and up to 75% in certain extreme scenarios) for popular LLMs like LLaMA2-7B-base and Mistral-7B-v0.3-base.</p></details> |  |
| **[PIG: Privacy Jailbreak Attack on LLMs via Gradient-based Iterative In-Context Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09921v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in various domains but pose inherent privacy risks. Existing methods to evaluate privacy leakage in LLMs often use memorized prefixes or simple instructions to extract data, both of which well-alignment models can easily block. Meanwhile, Jailbreak attacks bypass LLM safety mechanisms to generate harmful content, but their role in privacy scenarios remains underexplored. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of jailbreak attacks in extracting sensitive information, bridging privacy leakage and jailbreak attacks in LLMs. Moreover, we propose PIG, a novel framework targeting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and addressing the limitations of current jailbreak methods. Specifically, PIG identifies PII entities and their types in privacy queries, uses in-context learning to build a privacy context, and iteratively updates it with three gradient-based strategies to elicit target PII. We evaluate PIG and existing jailbreak methods using two privacy-related datasets. Experiments on four white-box and two black-box LLMs show that PIG outperforms baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) results. The results underscore significant privacy risks in LLMs, emphasizing the need for stronger safeguards.

Mainstream watermarking schemes for LLMs fall into two categories: logits-based and sampling-based. However, current schemes entail trade-offs among robustness, text quality, and security. To mitigate this, we integrate logits-based and sampling-based schemes, harnessing their respective strengths to achieve synergy. In this paper, we propose a versatile symbiotic watermarking framework with three strategies: serial, parallel, and hybrid. The hybrid framework adaptively embeds watermarks using token entropy and semantic entropy, optimizing the balance between detectability, robustness, text quality, and security. Furthermore, we validate our approach through comprehensive experiments on various datasets and models. Experimental results indicate that our method outperforms existing baselines and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. We believe this framework provides novel insights into diverse watermarking paradigms.

To address this gap, we propose a taxonomy of LLMs' ontological capabilities and introduce OntoURL, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs' proficiency in handling ontologies -- formal, symbolic representations of domain knowledge through concepts, relationships, and instances. Based on the proposed taxonomy, OntoURL systematically assesses three dimensions: understanding, reasoning, and learning through 15 distinct tasks comprising 58,981 questions derived from 40 ontologies across 8 domains. Experiments with 20 open-source LLMs reveal significant performance differences across models, tasks, and domains, with current LLMs showing proficiency in understanding ontological knowledge but substantial weaknesses in reasoning and learning tasks. These findings highlight fundamental limitations in LLMs' capability to process symbolic knowledge and establish OntoURL as a critical benchmark for advancing the integration of LLMs with formal knowledge representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper submitted to NeruoIPS 2025 dataset and benchmark track</p></details> |

While Transformer-based methods effectively capture global dependencies, they often overlook short-term local variations in time series. Recent methods that adapt large language models (LLMs) into time series forecasting inherit this limitation by treating LLMs as black-box encoders, relying solely on the final-layer output and underutilizing hierarchical representations. To address this limitation, we propose Logo-LLM, a novel LLM-based framework that explicitly extracts and models multi-scale temporal features from different layers of a pre-trained LLM. Through empirical analysis, we show that shallow layers of LLMs capture local dynamics in time series, while deeper layers encode global trends. Moreover, Logo-LLM introduces lightweight Local-Mixer and Global-Mixer modules to align and integrate features with the temporal input across layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Logo-LLM achieves superior performance across diverse benchmarks, with strong generalization in few-shot and zero-shot settings while maintaining low computational overhead.</p></details> |  |

However, prevailing benchmarks like DocVQA and ChartQA predominantly comprise \textit{scanned or digital} documents, inadequately reflecting the intricate challenges posed by diverse real-world scenarios, such as variable illumination and physical distortions. This paper introduces WildDoc, the inaugural benchmark designed specifically for assessing document understanding in natural environments. WildDoc incorporates a diverse set of manually captured document images reflecting real-world conditions and leverages document sources from established benchmarks to facilitate comprehensive comparisons with digital or scanned documents. Further, to rigorously evaluate model robustness, each document is captured four times under different conditions. Evaluations of state-of-the-art MLLMs on WildDoc expose substantial performance declines and underscore the models' inadequate robustness compared to traditional benchmarks, highlighting the unique challenges posed by real-world document understanding.

We present the results of the first controlled monetarily-incentivised laboratory experiment looking at differences in human behaviour in a multi-player p-beauty contest against other humans and LLMs. We use a within-subject design in order to compare behaviour at the individual level. We show that, in this environment, human subjects choose significantly lower numbers when playing against LLMs than humans, which is mainly driven by the increased prevalence of `zero' Nash-equilibrium choices. This shift is mainly driven by subjects with high strategic reasoning ability. Subjects who play the zero Nash-equilibrium choice motivate their strategy by appealing to perceived LLM's reasoning ability and, unexpectedly, propensity towards cooperation. Our findings provide foundational insights into the multi-player human-LLM interaction in simultaneous choice games, uncover heterogeneities in both subjects' behaviour and beliefs about LLM's play when playing against them, and suggest important implications for mechanism design in mixed human-LLM systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Review-Instruct: A Review-Driven Multi-Turn Conversations Generation Method for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11010v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in conversational AI is hindered by their reliance on single-turn supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data, which limits contextual coherence in multi-turn dialogues. Existing methods for generating multi-turn dialogue data struggle to ensure both diversity and quality in instructions. To address this, we propose Review-Instruct, a novel framework that synthesizes multi-turn conversations through an iterative "Ask-Respond-Review" process involving three agent roles: a Candidate, multiple Reviewers, and a Chairman. The framework iteratively refines instructions by incorporating Reviewer feedback, enhancing dialogue diversity and difficulty. We construct a multi-turn dataset using the Alpaca dataset and fine-tune the LLaMA2-13B model. Evaluations on MT-Bench, MMLU-Pro, and Auto-Arena demonstrate significant improvements, achieving absolute gains of 2.9\% on MMLU-Pro and 2\% on MT-Bench compared to prior state-of-the-art models based on LLaMA2-13B. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of the Review stage and the use of multiple Reviewers in boosting instruction diversity and difficulty. Our work highlights the potential of review-driven, multi-agent frameworks for generating high-quality conversational data at scale.</p></details> | ACL2025 Accepted |

These factors introduce significant decision complexity, which limits the adaptability of existing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods. In many DRL algorithms, especially those involving value-based or actor-critic structures, the critic component plays a key role in guiding policy learning by estimating value functions. However, conventional critic models often use shallow architectures that map observations directly to scalar estimates, limiting their ability to handle multi-task complexity. In contrast, recent progress in inference-time scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown that generating intermediate reasoning steps can significantly improve decision quality. Motivated by this, we propose ReaCritic, a large reasoning transformer-based criticmodel scaling scheme that brings reasoning ability into DRL. ReaCritic performs horizontal reasoning over parallel state-action inputs and vertical reasoning through deep transformer stacks. It is compatible with a broad range of value-based and actor-critic DRL algorithms and enhances generalization in dynamic wireless environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReaCritic improves convergence speed and final performance across various HetNet settings and standard OpenAI Gym control tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Item-Language Model for Conversational Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02844v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-language Models (LLMs) have been extremely successful at tasks like complex dialogue understanding, reasoning and coding due to their emergent abilities. These emergent abilities have been extended with multi-modality to include image, audio, and video capabilities. Recommender systems, on the other hand, have been critical for information seeking and item discovery needs. Recently, there have been attempts to apply LLMs for recommendations. One difficulty of current attempts is that the underlying LLM is usually not trained on the recommender system data, which largely contains user interaction signals and is often not publicly available. Another difficulty is user interaction signals often have a different pattern from natural language text, and it is currently unclear if the LLM training setup can learn more non-trivial knowledge from interaction signals compared with traditional recommender system methods. Finally, it is difficult to train multiple LLMs for different use-cases, and to retain the original language and reasoning abilities when learning from recommender system data. To address these three limitations, we propose an Item-Language Model (ILM), which is composed of an item encoder to produce text-aligned item representations that encode user interaction signals, and a frozen LLM that can understand those item representations with preserved pretrained knowledge. We conduct extensive experiments which demonstrate both the importance of the language-alignment and of user interaction knowledge in the item encoder.</p></details> | 15 pages, 3 figures |

However, there has been limited investigation of how various reasoning prompting strategies perform as scaling. In this paper, we focus on a standard and realistic scaling setting: majority voting. We systematically conduct experiments on 6 LLMs $\times$ 8 prompting strategies $\times$ 6 benchmarks. Experiment results consistently show that as the sampling time and computational overhead increase, complicated prompting strategies with superior initial performance gradually fall behind simple Chain-of-Thought. We analyze this phenomenon and provide theoretical proofs. Additionally, we propose a method according to probability theory to quickly and accurately predict the scaling performance and select the best strategy under large sampling times without extra resource-intensive inference in practice. It can serve as the test-time scaling law for majority voting. Furthermore, we introduce two ways derived from our theoretical analysis to significantly improve the scaling performance. We hope that our research can promote to re-examine the role of complicated prompting, unleash the potential of simple prompting strategies, and provide new insights for enhancing test-time scaling performance.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Main |
| **[Group-in-Group Policy Optimization for LLM Agent Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10978v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in group-based reinforcement learning (RL) have driven frontier large language models (LLMs) in single-turn tasks like mathematical reasoning. However, their scalability to long-horizon LLM agent training remains limited. Unlike static tasks, agent-environment interactions unfold over many steps and often yield sparse or delayed rewards, making credit assignment across individual steps significantly more challenging. In this work, we propose Group-in-Group Policy Optimization (GiGPO), a novel RL algorithm that achieves fine-grained credit assignment for LLM agents while preserving the appealing properties of group-based RL: critic-free, low memory, and stable convergence. GiGPO introduces a two-level structure for estimating relative advantage: (i) At the episode-level, GiGPO computes macro relative advantages based on groups of complete trajectories; (ii) At the step-level, GiGPO introduces an anchor state grouping mechanism that retroactively constructs step-level groups by identifying repeated environment states across trajectories. Actions stemming from the same state are grouped together, enabling micro relative advantage estimation. This hierarchical structure effectively captures both global trajectory quality and local step effectiveness without relying on auxiliary models or additional rollouts. We evaluate GiGPO on two challenging agent benchmarks, ALFWorld and WebShop, using Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. Crucially, GiGPO delivers fine-grained per-step credit signals and achieves performance gains of > 12\% on ALFWorld and > 9\% on WebShop over the GRPO baseline: all while maintaining the same GPU memory overhead, identical LLM rollout, and incurring little to no additional time cost.</p></details> | Preprint |

We also introduce a retrieval system that leverages both musical features and metadata to identify similar songs, which are then used to fill in missing metadata using a local large language model (LLLM). This approach allows us to provide a more comprehensive and informative dataset for researchers working on music-language understanding tasks. We validate this approach quantitatively with five different measurements. By making the JamendoMaxCaps dataset publicly available, we provide a high-quality resource to advance research in music-language understanding tasks such as music retrieval, multimodal representation learning, and generative music models.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[MPS-Prover: Advancing Stepwise Theorem Proving by Multi-Perspective Search and Data Curation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10962v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) in formal languages remains a formidable challenge in AI, demanding rigorous logical deduction and navigating vast search spaces. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance, existing stepwise provers often suffer from biased search guidance, leading to inefficiencies and suboptimal proof strategies. This paper introduces the Multi-Perspective Search Prover (MPS-Prover), a novel stepwise ATP system designed to overcome these limitations. MPS-Prover incorporates two key innovations: a highly effective post-training data curation strategy that prunes approximately 40% of redundant training data without sacrificing performance, and a multi-perspective tree search mechanism. This search integrates a learned critic model with strategically designed heuristic rules to diversify tactic selection, prevent getting trapped in unproductive states, and enhance search robustness. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MPS-Prover achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging benchmarks, including miniF2F and ProofNet, outperforming prior 7B parameter models. Furthermore, our analyses reveal that MPS-Prover generates significantly shorter and more diverse proofs compared to existing stepwise and whole-proof methods, highlighting its efficiency and efficacy. Our work advances the capabilities of LLM-based formal reasoning and offers a robust framework and a comprehensive analysis for developing more powerful theorem provers.</p></details> | Work in Progress |

We observe that for different queries, it could retrieve similar subgraphs as prompts, and thus we propose SubGCache, which aims to reduce inference latency by reusing computation across queries with similar structural prompts (i.e., subgraphs). Specifically, SubGCache clusters queries based on subgraph embeddings, constructs a representative subgraph for each cluster, and pre-computes the key-value (KV) cache of the representative subgraph. For each query with its retrieved subgraph within a cluster, it reuses the pre-computed KV cache of the representative subgraph of the cluster without computing the KV tensors again for saving computation. Experiments on two new datasets across multiple LLM backbones and graph-based RAG frameworks demonstrate that SubGCache consistently reduces inference latency with comparable and even improved generation quality, achieving up to 6.68$\times$ reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT).</p></details> |  |
| **[Do Theory of Mind Benchmarks Need Explicit Human-like Reasoning in Language Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01698v3)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to attribute mental states to others, is fundamental for human social intelligence and a critical capability for advanced Artificial Intelligence. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising performance on ToM benchmarks, raising the question: Do these benchmarks necessitate explicit human-like reasoning processes, or can models succeed through alternative strategies? We investigate this question empirically by applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to LLMs of varying scales (0.5B to 7B parameters) and evaluating them across multiple ToM datasets. Our results reveal a scale-dependent impact of RL: while RL significantly improves accuracy and fosters high-quality, interpretable, and transferable belief-tracking reasoning in larger models (7B), it leads to "reasoning collapse" in smaller models ($\leq$3B), where high accuracy and generalization ability are achieved via drastically shortened, less meaningful responses. Surprisingly, further SFT achieves competitive and generalizable performance across these benchmarks, often matching or exceeding RL models in accuracy, despite not being explicitly trained to produce structured reasoning traces. These findings highlight a critical discrepancy between benchmark accuracy and the nature of learned reasoning. Our work suggests that current ToM benchmarks may be solvable without requiring the explicit, human-like simulation of mental states they were designed to probe. LLMs, particularly when scale is limited or training signals focus solely on output correctness, may leverage alternative rules effective for benchmark data structures.</p></details> |  |

Here, we operationalize Conceptual Blending Theory (CBT) as an experimental framework, using prompt-based methods to reveal how LLMs blend and compress meaning. By systematically investigating Prompt-Induced Transitions (PIT) and Prompt-Induced Hallucinations (PIH), we uncover structural parallels and divergences between artificial and biological cognition. Our approach bridges linguistics, neuroscience, and empirical AI research, demonstrating that human-AI collaboration can serve as a living prototype for the future of cognitive science. This work proposes prompt engineering not just as a technical tool, but as a scientific method for probing the deep structure of meaning itself.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a semantic multiple access scheme in the token domain, referred to as token domain multiple access (ToDMA), where a large number of devices share a token codebook and a modulation codebook for source and channel coding, respectively. Specifically, each transmitter first tokenizes its source signal and modulate each token to a codeword. At the receiver, compressed sensing is employed first to detect active tokens and the corresponding channel state information (CSI) from the superposed signals. Then, the source token sequences are reconstructed by clustering the token-associated CSI across multiple time slots. In case of token collisions, some active tokens cannot be assigned and some positions in the reconstructed token sequences are empty. We propose to use pre-trained MLLMs to leverage the context, predict masked tokens, and thus mitigate token collisions. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ToDMA framework for both text and image transmission tasks, achieving significantly lower latency compared to context-unaware orthogonal communication schemes, while also delivering superior distortion and perceptual quality compared to state-of-the-art context-unaware non-orthogonal communication methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2502.06118</p></details> |

However, most approaches, which blend the source model's embedding by replacing the source vocabulary with the target language-specific vocabulary, may constrain expressive capacity in the target language since the source model is predominantly trained on English data. In this paper, we propose Semantic Aware Linear Transfer (SALT), a novel cross-lingual transfer technique that recycles embeddings from target language Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to transmit the deep representational strengths of PLM-derived embedding to LLMs. SALT derives unique regression lines based on the similarity in the overlap of the source and target vocabularies, to handle each non-overlapping token's embedding space. Our extensive experiments show that SALT significantly outperforms other transfer methods and achieves lower loss with accelerating faster convergence during language adaptation. Notably, SALT obtains remarkable performance in cross-lingual understanding setups compared to other methods. Furthermore, we highlight the scalable use of PLMs to enhance the functionality of contemporary LLMs by conducting experiments with varying architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 Findings</p></details> |

| **[RAGSynth: Synthetic Data for Robust and Faithful RAG Component Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10989v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RAG can enhance the performance of LLMs on knowledge-intensive tasks. Various RAG paradigms, including vanilla, planning-based, and iterative RAG, are built upon 2 cores: the retriever, which should robustly select relevant documents across complex queries, and the generator, which should faithfully synthesize responses. However, existing retrievers rely heavily on public knowledge and struggle with queries of varying logical complexity and clue completeness, while generators frequently face fidelity problems. In this work, we introduce RAGSynth, a framework that includes a data construction modeling and a corresponding synthetic data generation implementation, designed to optimize retriever robustness and generator fidelity. Additionally, we present SynthBench, a benchmark encompassing 8 domain-specific documents across 4 domains, featuring diverse query complexities, clue completeness, and fine-grained citation granularity. Leveraging RAGSynth, we generate a large-scale synthetic dataset, including single and multi-hop. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the synthetic data significantly improves the robustness of the retrievers and the fidelity of the generators. Additional evaluations confirm that RAGSynth can also generalize well across different domains. By integrating the optimized retrievers into various RAG paradigms, we consistently observe enhanced RAG system performance. We have open-sourced the implementation on https://github.com/EachSheep/RAGSynth.</p></details> |  |

| **[Investigating Language Preference of Multilingual RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11175v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) systems enhance language models by integrating external multilingual information to produce context-aware responses. However, mRAG systems struggle with retrieving relevant information due to linguistic variations between queries and documents, generating inconsistent responses when multilingual sources conflict. In this work, we systematically investigate language preferences in both retrieval and generation of mRAG through a series of experiments. Our analysis indicates that retrievers tend to prefer high-resource and query languages, yet this preference does not consistently improve generation performance. Moreover, we observe that generators prefer the query language or Latin scripts, leading to inconsistent outputs. To overcome these issues, we propose Dual Knowledge Multilingual RAG (DKM-RAG), a simple yet effective framework that fuses translated multilingual passages with complementary model knowledge. Empirical results demonstrate that DKM-RAG mitigates language preference in generation and enhances performance across diverse linguistic settings.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Findings |
| **[Towards Automated Situation Awareness: A RAG-Based Framework for Peacebuilding Reports](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10586v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Timely and accurate situation awareness is vital for decision-making in humanitarian response, conflict monitoring, and early warning and early action. However, the manual analysis of vast and heterogeneous data sources often results in delays, limiting the effectiveness of interventions. This paper introduces a dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that autonomously generates situation awareness reports by integrating real-time data from diverse sources, including news articles, conflict event databases, and economic indicators. Our system constructs query-specific knowledge bases on demand, ensuring timely, relevant, and accurate insights. To ensure the quality of generated reports, we propose a three-level evaluation framework that combines semantic similarity metrics, factual consistency checks, and expert feedback. The first level employs automated NLP metrics to assess coherence and factual accuracy. The second level involves human expert evaluation to verify the relevance and completeness of the reports. The third level utilizes LLM-as-a-Judge, where large language models provide an additional layer of assessment to ensure robustness. The system is tested across multiple real-world scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing coherent, insightful, and actionable reports. By automating report generation, our approach reduces the burden on human analysts and accelerates decision-making processes. To promote reproducibility and further research, we openly share our code and evaluation tools with the community via GitHub.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAG-Enabled Intent Reasoning for Application-Network Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09339v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intent-based network (IBN) is a promising solution to automate network operation and management. IBN aims to offer human-tailored network interaction, allowing the network to communicate in a way that aligns with the network users' language, rather than requiring the network users to understand the technical language of the network/devices. Nowadays, different applications interact with the network, each with its own specialized needs and domain language. Creating semantic languages (i.e., ontology-based languages) and associating them with each application to facilitate intent translation lacks technical expertise and is neither practical nor scalable. To tackle the aforementioned problem, we propose a context-aware AI framework that utilizes machine reasoning (MR), retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and generative AI technologies to interpret intents from different applications and generate structured network intents. The proposed framework allows for generalized/domain-specific intent expression and overcomes the drawbacks of large language models (LLMs) and vanilla-RAG framework. The experimental results show that our proposed intent-RAG framework outperforms the LLM and vanilla-RAG framework in intent translation.</p></details> |  |

Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a promising method for improving multistep reasoning by guiding models through intermediate steps. However, CoT alone does not fully address the hallucination problem. In this work, we investigate how combining CoT with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), as well as applying self-consistency and self-verification strategies, can reduce hallucinations and improve factual accuracy. By incorporating external knowledge sources during reasoning and enabling models to verify or revise their own outputs, we aim to generate more accurate and coherent responses. We present a comparative evaluation of baseline LLMs against CoT, CoT+RAG, self-consistency, and self-verification techniques. Our results highlight the effectiveness of each method and identify the most robust approach for minimizing hallucinations while preserving fluency and reasoning depth.</p></details> |  |

By combining structured knowledge graphs with contextually enriched text segments, Graph RAG offers a promising solution to address the inherent complexity and vast volume of legal data. The integration of hierarchical structure and temporal evolution into knowledge graphs - along with the concept of comprehensive Text Units - facilitates the construction of richer, interconnected representations of legal knowledge. Through a detailed analysis of Graph RAG and its application to legal norm datasets, this article aims to advance the field of Artificial Intelligence applied to Law, creating opportunities for more effective systems in legal research, legislative analysis, and decision support.</p></details> |  |
| **[Securing RAG: A Risk Assessment and Mitigation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08728v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the de facto industry standard for user-facing NLP applications, offering the ability to integrate data without re-training or fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs). This capability enhances the quality and accuracy of responses but also introduces novel security and privacy challenges, particularly when sensitive data is integrated. With the rapid adoption of RAG, securing data and services has become a critical priority. This paper first reviews the vulnerabilities of RAG pipelines, and outlines the attack surface from data pre-processing and data storage management to integration with LLMs. The identified risks are then paired with corresponding mitigations in a structured overview. In a second step, the paper develops a framework that combines RAG-specific security considerations, with existing general security guidelines, industry standards, and best practices. The proposed framework aims to guide the implementation of robust, compliant, secure, and trustworthy RAG systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, Sara Ott and Lukas Ammann contributed equally</p></details> |

This study explores the application of RAG-enhanced LLMs coupled with pathology foundation models for thyroid cytology diagnosis, addressing challenges in cytological interpretation, standardization, and diagnostic accuracy. By leveraging a curated knowledge base, RAG facilitates dy-namic retrieval of relevant case studies, diagnostic criteria, and expert interpreta-tion, improving the contextual understanding of LLMs. Meanwhile, pathology foun-dation models, trained on high-resolution pathology images, refine feature extrac-tion and classification capabilities. The fusion of these AI-driven approaches en-hances diagnostic consistency, reduces variability, and supports pathologists in dis-tinguishing benign from malignant thyroid lesions. Our results demonstrate that integrating RAG with pathology-specific LLMs significantly improves diagnostic efficiency and interpretability, paving the way for AI-assisted thyroid cytopathology, with foundation model UNI achieving AUC 0.73-0.93 for correct prediction of surgi-cal pathology diagnosis from thyroid cytology samples.</p></details> |  |

This transforms RAG from a passive retriever into an accountable generator of calibrated exam items. Technically, the framework fuses knowledge graphs, RAG retrieval, and educational assessment theory into a single pipeline. Domain passages are parsed into a structured graph; graph-aware retrieval feeds fact chains to an LLM; and an assessment layer governed by Bloom's Taxonomy levels and Item Response Theory (IRT) transforms those chains into psychometrically sound questions. This cross-disciplinary marriage yields two scholarly contributions: it shows how semantic graph contexts guide LLM reasoning paths, and it operationalizes difficulty metrics within the generation process, producing items whose IRT parameters match expert benchmarks. Every module, from KG construction scripts to the multi-agent reasoning scheduler and the automatic IRT validator, is openly released on GitHub. This enables peer laboratories to replicate experiments, benchmark against baselines, and extend individual components without licensing barriers. Its reproducible design paves the way for rigorous ablation studies, cross-domain transfer experiments, and shared leaderboards on multi-step reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Through a case study at a maritime service provider, we demonstrate how data scientists face a fundamental tension between user expectations of AI perfection and the correctness of the generated outputs. Our findings reveal that data scientists must identify context-specific "retrieval requirements" through iterative experimentation together with users because they are the ones who can determine correctness. We present an empirical process model describing how data scientists practically elicited these "retrieval requirements" and managed system limitations.

| **[Why Uncertainty Estimation Methods Fall Short in RAG: An Axiomatic Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07459v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are valued for their strong performance across various tasks, but they also produce inaccurate or misleading outputs. Uncertainty Estimation (UE) quantifies the model's confidence and helps users assess response reliability. However, existing UE methods have not been thoroughly examined in scenarios like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), where the input prompt includes non-parametric knowledge. This paper shows that current UE methods cannot reliably assess correctness in the RAG setting. We further propose an axiomatic framework to identify deficiencies in existing methods and guide the development of improved approaches. Our framework introduces five constraints that an effective UE method should meet after incorporating retrieved documents into the LLM's prompt. Experimental results reveal that no existing UE method fully satisfies all the axioms, explaining their suboptimal performance in RAG. We further introduce a simple yet effective calibration function based on our framework, which not only satisfies more axioms than baseline methods but also improves the correlation between uncertainty estimates and correctness.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we shed light on this core issue and formulate the distracting effect of a passage w.r.t. a query (and an LLM). We provide a quantifiable measure of the distracting effect of a passage and demonstrate its robustness across LLMs. Our research introduces novel methods for identifying and using hard distracting passages to improve RAG systems. By fine-tuning LLMs with these carefully selected distracting passages, we achieve up to a 7.5% increase in answering accuracy compared to counterparts fine-tuned on conventional RAG datasets. Our contribution is two-fold: first, we move beyond the simple binary classification of irrelevant passages as either completely unrelated vs. distracting, and second, we develop and analyze multiple methods for finding hard distracting passages. To our knowledge, no other research has provided such a comprehensive framework for identifying and utilizing hard distracting passages.</p></details> |  |
| **[MacRAG: Compress, Slice, and Scale-up for Multi-Scale Adaptive Context RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06569v1)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-context (LC) Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) hold strong potential for complex multi-hop and large-document tasks. However, existing RAG systems often suffer from imprecise retrieval, incomplete context coverage under constrained context windows, and fragmented information caused by suboptimal context construction. We introduce Multi-scale Adaptive Context RAG (MacRAG), a hierarchical retrieval framework that compresses and partitions documents into coarse-to-fine granularities, then adaptively merges relevant contexts through chunk- and document-level expansions in real time. By starting from the finest-level retrieval and progressively incorporating higher-level and broader context, MacRAG constructs effective query-specific long contexts, optimizing both precision and coverage. Evaluations on the challenging LongBench expansions of HotpotQA, 2WikiMultihopQA, and Musique confirm that MacRAG consistently surpasses baseline RAG pipelines on single- and multi-step generation with Llama-3.1-8B, Gemini-1.5-pro, and GPT-4o. Our results establish MacRAG as an efficient, scalable solution for real-world long-context, multi-hop reasoning. Our code is available at https://github.com/Leezekun/MacRAG.</p></details> |  |

This is particularly relevant in nature, where new species are discovered every year. In this work, we focus on open-vocabulary bird species recognition, where the goal is to classify species based on their descriptions without being constrained to a predefined set of taxonomic categories. Traditional benchmarks like CUB-200-2011 and Birdsnap have been evaluated in a closed-vocabulary paradigm, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios where novel species continually emerge. We show that the performance of current systems when evaluated under settings closely aligned with open-vocabulary drops by a huge margin. To address this gap, we propose a scalable framework integrating structured textual knowledge from Wikipedia articles of 11,202 bird species distilled via GPT-4o into concise, discriminative summaries. We propose Visual Re-ranking Retrieval-Augmented Generation(VR-RAG), a novel, retrieval-augmented generation framework that uses visual similarities to rerank the top m candidates retrieved by a set of multimodal vision language encoders. This allows for the recognition of unseen taxa. Extensive experiments across five established classification benchmarks show that our approach is highly effective. By integrating VR-RAG, we improve the average performance of state-of-the-art Large Multi-Modal Model QWEN2.5-VL by 15.4% across five benchmarks. Our approach outperforms conventional VLM-based approaches, which struggle with unseen species. By bridging the gap between encyclopedic knowledge and visual recognition, our work advances open-vocabulary recognition, offering a flexible, scalable solution for biodiversity monitoring and ecological research.</p></details> | 7 figures |

This includes the LLM, embedding, and ranker models themselves, as well as hyperparameters governing individual RAG components. Yet, collectively optimizing the entire configuration in a RAG or LLM system remains under-explored - especially in multi-objective settings - due to intractably large solution spaces, noisy objective evaluations, and the high cost of evaluations. In this work, we introduce the first approach for multi-objective parameter optimization of cost, latency, safety and alignment over entire LLM and RAG systems. We find that Bayesian optimization methods significantly outperform baseline approaches, obtaining a superior Pareto front on two new RAG benchmark tasks. We conclude our work with important considerations for practitioners who are designing multi-objective RAG systems, highlighting nuances such as how optimal configurations may not generalize across tasks and objectives.</p></details> |  |

However, even when provided context, LLMs still frequently introduce unsupported information or contradictions. This paper presents our efforts to measure LLM hallucinations with a focus on summarization tasks, assessing how often various LLMs introduce hallucinations when summarizing documents. We discuss Vectara's existing LLM hallucination leaderboard, based on the Hughes Hallucination Evaluation Model (HHEM). While HHEM and Vectara's Hallucination Leaderboard have garnered great research interest, we examine challenges faced by HHEM and current hallucination detection methods by analyzing the effectiveness of these methods on existing hallucination datasets. To address these limitations, we propose FaithJudge, an LLM-as-a-judge approach guided by few-shot human hallucination annotations, which substantially improves automated LLM hallucination evaluation over current methods. We introduce an enhanced hallucination leaderboard centered on FaithJudge, alongside our current hallucination leaderboard, enabling more reliable benchmarking of LLMs for hallucinations in RAG.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we introduce lightweight LLM-independent adaptive retrieval methods based on external information. We investigated 27 features, organized into 7 groups, and their hybrid combinations. We evaluated these methods on 6 QA datasets, assessing the QA performance and efficiency. The results show that our approach matches the performance of complex LLM-based methods while achieving significant efficiency gains, demonstrating the potential of external information for adaptive retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, complex tasks requiring multi-round retrieval remain challenging, and early attempts tend to be overly optimistic without a good sense of self-skepticism. Current multi-round RAG systems may continue searching even when enough information has already been retrieved, or they may provide incorrect answers without having sufficient information or knowledge. Existing solutions either require large amounts of expensive human-labeled process supervision data or lead to subpar performance. This paper aims to address these limitations by introducing a new framework, \textbf{SIM-RAG}, to explicitly enhance RAG systems' self-awareness and multi-round retrieval capabilities. To train SIM-RAG, we first let a RAG system self-practice multi-round retrieval, augmenting existing question-answer pairs with intermediate inner monologue reasoning steps to generate synthetic training data. For each pair, the system may explore multiple retrieval paths, which are labeled as successful if they reach the correct answer and unsuccessful otherwise. Using this data, we train a lightweight information sufficiency Critic. At inference time, the Critic evaluates whether the RAG system has retrieved sufficient information at each round, guiding retrieval decisions and improving system-level self-awareness through in-context reinforcement learning. Experiments across multiple prominent RAG benchmarks show that SIM-RAG is an effective multi-round RAG solution. Furthermore, this framework is system-efficient, adding a lightweight component to RAG without requiring modifications to existing LLMs or search engines, and data-efficient, eliminating the need for costly human-annotated mid-step retrieval process supervision data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 48th International ACM SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

This paper presents an automated radiology report generation framework that combines Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) with a Multi-Agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to bridge AI performance with clinical explainability. CBMs map chest X-ray features to human-understandable clinical concepts, enabling transparent disease classification. Meanwhile, the RAG system integrates multi-agent collaboration and external knowledge to produce contextually rich, evidence-based reports. Our demonstration showcases the system's ability to deliver interpretable predictions, mitigate hallucinations, and generate high-quality, tailored reports with an interactive interface addressing accuracy, trust, and usability challenges.

This results in non-uniform cluster access patterns in disk-based vector search systems, particularly in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. While existing approaches optimize individual queries, they overlook the impact of cluster access patterns, failing to account for the locality effects of queries that access similar clusters. This oversight reduces cache efficiency and increases search latency due to excessive disk I/O. To address this, we introduce CaGR-RAG, a context-aware query grouping mechanism that organizes queries based on shared cluster access patterns. Additionally, it incorporates opportunistic cluster prefetching to minimize cache misses during transitions between query groups, further optimizing retrieval performance. Experimental results show that CaGR-RAG reduces 99th percentile tail latency by up to 51.55% while consistently maintaining a higher cache hit ratio than the baseline.</p></details> |  |

However, efficient deployment of these systems presents significant technical challenges due to their inherently heterogeneous computational pipelines comprising LLMs, databases, and specialized processing components. We introduce Patchwork, a comprehensive end-to-end RAG serving framework designed to address these efficiency bottlenecks. Patchwork's architecture offers three key innovations: First, it provides a flexible specification interface enabling users to implement custom RAG pipelines. Secondly, it deploys these pipelines as distributed inference systems while optimizing for the unique scalability characteristics of individual RAG components. Third, Patchwork incorporates an online scheduling mechanism that continuously monitors request load and execution progress, dynamically minimizing SLO violations through strategic request prioritization and resource auto-scaling. Our experimental evaluation across four distinct RAG implementations demonstrates that Patchwork delivers substantial performance improvements over commercial alternatives, achieving throughput gains exceeding 48% while simultaneously reducing SLO violations by ~24%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can LLMs Be Trusted for Evaluating RAG Systems? A Survey of Methods and Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20119v2)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has advanced significantly in recent years. The complexity of RAG systems, which involve multiple components-such as indexing, retrieval, and generation-along with numerous other parameters, poses substantial challenges for systematic evaluation and quality enhancement. Previous research highlights that evaluating RAG systems is essential for documenting advancements, comparing configurations, and identifying effective approaches for domain-specific applications. This study systematically reviews 63 academic articles to provide a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art RAG evaluation methodologies, focusing on four key areas: datasets, retrievers, indexing and databases, and the generator component. We observe the feasibility of an automated evaluation approach for each component of a RAG system, leveraging an LLM capable of both generating evaluation datasets and conducting evaluations. In addition, we found that further practical research is essential to provide companies with clear guidance on the do's and don'ts of implementing and evaluating RAG systems. By synthesizing evaluation approaches for key RAG components and emphasizing the creation and adaptation of domain-specific datasets for benchmarking, we contribute to the advancement of systematic evaluation methods and the improvement of evaluation rigor for RAG systems. Furthermore, by examining the interplay between automated approaches leveraging LLMs and human judgment, we contribute to the ongoing discourse on balancing automation and human input, clarifying their respective contributions, limitations, and challenges in achieving robust and reliable evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 Pag...</summary><p>8 Pages.

A clear separation of private information from the LLM training has made RAG the basis for many enterprise LLM workloads as it allows the company to augment LLM's understanding using customers' private documents. Despite its popularity for private documents in enterprise deployments, current RAG benchmarks for validating and optimizing RAG pipelines draw their corpora from public data such as Wikipedia or generic web pages and offer little to no personal context. Seeking to empower more personal and private RAG we release the EnronQA benchmark, a dataset of 103,638 emails with 528,304 question-answer pairs across 150 different user inboxes. EnronQA enables better benchmarking of RAG pipelines over private data and allows for experimentation on the introduction of personalized retrieval settings over realistic data. Finally, we use EnronQA to explore the tradeoff in memorization and retrieval when reasoning over private documents.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[SAGE: A Framework of Precise Retrieval for RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01713v2)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated significant proficiency in conducting question-answering (QA) tasks within a specified corpus. Nonetheless, numerous failure instances of RAG in QA still exist. These failures are not solely attributable to the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs); instead, they predominantly arise from the retrieval of inaccurate information for LLMs due to two limitations: (1) Current RAG methods segment the corpus without considering semantics, making it difficult to find relevant context due to impaired correlation between questions and the segments. (2) There is a trade-off between missing essential context with fewer context retrieved and getting irrelevant context with more context retrieved. In this paper, we introduce a RAG framework (SAGE), to overcome these limitations. First, to address the segmentation issue without considering semantics, we propose to train a semantic segmentation model. This model is trained to segment the corpus into semantically complete chunks. Second, to ensure that only the most relevant chunks are retrieved while the irrelevant ones are ignored, we design a chunk selection algorithm to dynamically select chunks based on the decreasing speed of the relevance score, leading to a more relevant selection. Third, to further ensure the precision of the retrieved chunks, we propose letting LLMs assess whether retrieved chunks are excessive or lacking and then adjust the amount of context accordingly. Experiments show that SAGE outperforms baselines by 61.25% in the quality of QA on average. Moreover, by avoiding retrieving noisy context, SAGE lowers the cost of the tokens consumed in LLM inference and achieves a 49.41% enhancement in cost efficiency on average. Additionally, our work offers valuable insights for boosting RAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Talk Before You Retrieve: Agent-Led Discussions for Better RAG in Medical QA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21252v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical question answering (QA) is a reasoning-intensive task that remains challenging for large language models (LLMs) due to hallucinations and outdated domain knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) provides a promising post-training solution by leveraging external knowledge. However, existing medical RAG systems suffer from two key limitations: (1) a lack of modeling for human-like reasoning behaviors during information retrieval, and (2) reliance on suboptimal medical corpora, which often results in the retrieval of irrelevant or noisy snippets. To overcome these challenges, we propose Discuss-RAG, a plug-and-play module designed to enhance the medical QA RAG system through collaborative agent-based reasoning. Our method introduces a summarizer agent that orchestrates a team of medical experts to emulate multi-turn brainstorming, thereby improving the relevance of retrieved content. Additionally, a decision-making agent evaluates the retrieved snippets before their final integration. Experimental results on four benchmark medical QA datasets show that Discuss-RAG consistently outperforms MedRAG, especially significantly improving answer accuracy by up to 16.67% on BioASQ and 12.20% on PubMedQA. The code is available at: https://github.com/LLM-VLM-GSL/Discuss-RAG.</p></details> |  |

Within financial sectors, modern enterprises increasingly rely on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to address complex compliance requirements in financial document workflows. However, existing solutions struggle to account for the inherent heterogeneity of data (e.g., text, tables, diagrams) and evolving nature of regulatory standards used in financial filings, leading to compromised accuracy in critical information extraction. We propose the FinSage framework as a solution, utilizing a multi-aspect RAG framework tailored for regulatory compliance analysis in multi-modal financial documents. FinSage introduces three innovative components: (1) a multi-modal pre-processing pipeline that unifies diverse data formats and generates chunk-level metadata summaries, (2) a multi-path sparse-dense retrieval system augmented with query expansion (HyDE) and metadata-aware semantic search, and (3) a domain-specialized re-ranking module fine-tuned via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to prioritize compliance-critical content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FinSage achieves an impressive recall of 92.51% on 75 expert-curated questions derived from surpasses the best baseline method on the FinanceBench question answering datasets by 24.06% in accuracy. Moreover, FinSage has been successfully deployed as financial question-answering agent in online meetings, where it has already served more than 1,200 people.</p></details> |  |
| **[SLA Management in Reconfigurable Multi-Agent RAG: A Systems Approach to Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06832v2)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to generalize to new information by decoupling reasoning capabilities from static knowledge bases. Traditional RAG enhancements have explored vertical scaling-assigning subtasks to specialized modules-and horizontal scaling-replicating tasks across multiple agents-to improve performance. However, real-world applications impose diverse Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, involving trade-offs among objectives such as reducing cost, ensuring answer quality, and adhering to specific operational constraints. In this work, we present a systems-oriented approach to multi-agent RAG tailored for real-world Question Answering (QA) applications. By integrating task-specific non-functional requirements-such as answer quality, cost, and latency-into the system, we enable dynamic reconfiguration to meet diverse SLAs. Our method maps these Service Level Objectives (SLOs) to system-level parameters, allowing the generation of optimal results within specified resource constraints. We conduct a case study in the QA domain, demonstrating how dynamic re-orchestration of a multi-agent RAG system can effectively manage the trade-off between answer quality and cost. By adjusting the system based on query intent and operational conditions, we systematically balance performance and resource utilization. This approach allows the system to meet SLOs for various query types, showcasing its practicality for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

It proposes a state-aware dynamic knowledge retrieval mechanism to enhance semantic understanding and knowledge scheduling efficiency in large language models for open-domain question answering and complex generation tasks. The method introduces a multi-level perceptive retrieval vector construction strategy and a differentiable document matching path. These components enable end-to-end joint training and collaborative optimization of the retrieval and generation modules. This effectively addresses the limitations of static RAG structures in context adaptation and knowledge access. Experiments are conducted on the Natural Questions dataset. The proposed structure is thoroughly evaluated across different large models, including GPT-4, GPT-4o, and DeepSeek. Comparative and ablation experiments from multiple perspectives confirm the significant improvements in BLEU and ROUGE-L scores. The approach also demonstrates stronger robustness and generation consistency in tasks involving semantic ambiguity and multi-document fusion. These results highlight its broad application potential and practical value in building high-quality language generation systems.</p></details> |  |

As a result, recent efforts focus on instruction-tuning open-source LLMs, though the potential of combining them with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we are the first to explore a knowledge graph-based (KG) RAG framework for Japanese medical QA small-scale open-source LLMs. Experimental results show that KG-based RAG has only a limited impact on Japanese medical QA using small-scale open-source LLMs. Further case studies reveal that the effectiveness of the RAG is sensitive to the quality and relevance of the external retrieved content. These findings offer valuable insights into the challenges and potential of applying RAG in Japanese medical QA, while also serving as a reference for other low-resource languages.</p></details> | 10 pages |

To address this limitation, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance LLMs by retrieving relevant information from external sources, thereby positioning the retriever as a pivotal component. Although dense retrieval demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, its training poses challenges due to the scarcity of ground-truth evidence, largely attributed to the high costs of human annotation. In this paper, we propose W-RAG, a method that draws weak training signals from the downstream task (such as OpenQA) of an LLM, and fine-tunes the retriever to prioritize passages that most benefit the task. Specifically, we rerank the top-$k$ passages retrieved via BM25 by assessing the probability that the LLM will generate the correct answer for a question given each passage. The highest-ranking passages are then used as positive fine-tuning examples for dense retrieval. We conduct comprehensive experiments across four publicly available OpenQA datasets to demonstrate that our approach enhances both retrieval and OpenQA performance compared to baseline models, achieving results comparable to models fine-tuned with human-labeled data.</p></details> |  |

Pleias-RAG-350m and Pleias-RAG-1B are mid-trained on a large synthetic dataset emulating the retrieval of a wide variety of multilingual open sources from the Common Corpus. They provide native support for citation and grounding with literal quotes and reintegrate multiple features associated with RAG workflows, such as query routing, query reformulation, and source reranking. Pleias-RAG-350m and Pleias-RAG-1B outperform SLMs below 4 billion parameters on standardized RAG benchmarks (HotPotQA, 2wiki) and are competitive with popular larger models, including Qwen-2.5-7B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Gemma-3-4B. They are the only SLMs to date maintaining consistent RAG performance across leading European languages and ensuring systematic reference grounding for statements. Due to their size and ease of deployment on constrained infrastructure and higher factuality by design, the models unlock a range of new use cases for generative AI.</p></details> |  |

However, despite the widespread use of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, AI safety work focuses on standard LLMs, which means we know little about how RAG use cases change a model's safety profile. We conduct a detailed comparative analysis of RAG and non-RAG frameworks with eleven LLMs. We find that RAG can make models less safe and change their safety profile. We explore the causes of this change and find that even combinations of safe models with safe documents can cause unsafe generations. In addition, we evaluate some existing red teaming methods for RAG settings and show that they are less effective than when used for non-RAG settings. Our work highlights the need for safety research and red-teaming methods specifically tailored for RAG LLMs.</p></details> | NAACL 2025 |

While many studies focus on evaluating the overall quality of end-to-end RAG systems, there is a gap in understanding the appropriateness of LLMs for the RAG task. To address this, we introduce Trust-Score, a holistic metric that evaluates the trustworthiness of LLMs within the RAG framework. Our results show that various prompting methods, such as in-context learning, fail to effectively adapt LLMs to the RAG task as measured by Trust-Score. Consequently, we propose Trust-Align, a method to align LLMs for improved Trust-Score performance. 26 out of 27 models aligned using Trust-Align substantially outperform competitive baselines on ASQA, QAMPARI, and ELI5. Specifically, in LLaMA-3-8b, Trust-Align outperforms FRONT on ASQA (up 12.56), QAMPARI (up 36.04), and ELI5 (up 17.69). Trust-Align also significantly enhances models' ability to correctly refuse and provide quality citations. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of Trust-Align across different open-weight models, including the LLaMA series (1b to 8b), Qwen-2.5 series (0.5b to 7b), and Phi3.5 (3.8b).

By synergizing retrieval mechanisms with advanced reasoning, LLMs can now tackle increasingly complex problems. This paper presents a systematic review of the collaborative interplay between RAG and reasoning, clearly defining "reasoning" within the RAG context. It construct a comprehensive taxonomy encompassing multi-dimensional collaborative objectives, representative paradigms, and technical implementations, and analyze the bidirectional synergy methods. Additionally, we critically evaluate current limitations in RAG assessment, including the absence of intermediate supervision for multi-step reasoning and practical challenges related to cost-risk trade-offs. To bridge theory and practice, we provide practical guidelines tailored to diverse real-world applications. Finally, we identify promising research directions, such as graph-based knowledge integration, hybrid model collaboration, and RL-driven optimization. Overall, this work presents a theoretical framework and practical foundation to advance RAG systems in academia and industry, fostering the next generation of RAG solutions.</p></details> |  |

As generalized models, LLMs often struggle to provide context-specific information, particularly in areas requiring specialized knowledge. In this work we propose a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based multi-agent LLM system to support analysis and decision-making in the context of natural hazards and extreme weather events. As a proof of concept, we present WildfireGPT, a specialized system focused on wildfire hazards. The architecture employs a user-centered, multi-agent design to deliver tailored risk insights across diverse stakeholder groups. By integrating natural hazard and extreme weather projection data, observational datasets, and scientific literature through an RAG framework, the system ensures both the accuracy and contextual relevance of the information it provides. Evaluation across ten expert-led case studies demonstrates that WildfireGPT significantly outperforms existing LLM-based solutions for decision support.</p></details> |  |

However, fairness and reliability concerns persist, as hallucinations can emerge at both the retrieval and generation stages, affecting users' reasoning and decision-making. Our research explores how tailored warning messages -- whose content depends on the specific context of hallucination -- shape user reasoning and actions in an educational quiz setting. Preliminary findings suggest that while warnings improve accuracy and awareness of high-level hallucinations, they may also introduce cognitive friction, leading to confusion and diminished trust in the system. By examining these interactions, this work contributes to the broader goal of AI-augmented reasoning: developing systems that actively support human reflection, critical thinking, and informed decision-making rather than passive information consumption.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 2025 ACM Workshop on Human-AI Interaction for Augmented Reasoning</p></details> |

However, deviations in reasoning paths or errors in intermediate results, which are common in current RAG methods, may propagate and accumulate throughout the reasoning process, diminishing the accuracy of the answer to complex queries. To address this challenge, we propose the Plan-then-Act-and-Review (PAR RAG) framework, which is organized into three key stages: planning, act, and review, and aims to offer an interpretable and incremental reasoning paradigm for accurate and reliable multi-hop question answering by mitigating error propagation.PAR RAG initially applies a top-down problem decomposition strategy, formulating a comprehensive plan that integrates multiple executable steps from a holistic viewpoint. This approach avoids the pitfalls of local optima common in traditional RAG methods, ensuring the accuracy of the entire reasoning path. Subsequently, PAR RAG incorporates a plan execution mechanism based on multi-granularity verification. By utilizing both coarse-grained similarity information and fine-grained relevant data, the framework thoroughly checks and adjusts intermediate results, ensuring process accuracy while effectively managing error propagation and amplification. Experimental results on multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that the PAR RAG framework substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in key metrics, including EM and F1 scores.</p></details> | 18 pages, 3 figures |

Existing methods, which operate at the document level, fail to effectively filter out such content. We propose LLM-driven chunk filtering, ChunkRAG, a framework that enhances RAG systems by evaluating and filtering retrieved information at the chunk level. Our approach employs semantic chunking to divide documents into coherent sections and utilizes LLM-based relevance scoring to assess each chunk's alignment with the user's query. By filtering out less pertinent chunks before the generation phase, we significantly reduce hallucinations and improve factual accuracy. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing RAG models, achieving higher accuracy on tasks requiring precise information retrieval. This advancement enhances the reliability of RAG systems, making them particularly beneficial for applications like fact-checking and multi-hop reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, Student Research Workshop 2025 (NAACL SRW 2025)</p></details> |

To answer this question, we investigate the efficacy of crowdsourcing for RAG through two complementary studies: response writing and response utility judgment. We present the Crowd RAG Corpus 2025 (CrowdRAG-25), which consists of 903 human-written and 903 LLM-generated responses for the 301 topics of the TREC RAG'24 track, across the three discourse styles 'bulleted list', 'essay', and 'news'. For a selection of 65 topics, the corpus further contains 47,320 pairwise human judgments and 10,556 pairwise LLM judgments across seven utility dimensions (e.g., coverage and coherence). Our analyses give insights into human writing behavior for RAG and the viability of crowdsourcing for RAG evaluation. Human pairwise judgments provide reliable and cost-effective results compared to LLM-based pairwise or human/LLM-based pointwise judgments, as well as automated comparisons with human-written reference responses.

| **[CiteFix: Enhancing RAG Accuracy Through Post-Processing Citation Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15629v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful application of Large Language Models (LLMs), revolutionizing information search and consumption. RAG systems combine traditional search capabilities with LLMs to generate comprehensive answers to user queries, ideally with accurate citations. However, in our experience of developing a RAG product, LLMs often struggle with source attribution, aligning with other industry studies reporting citation accuracy rates of only about 74% for popular generative search engines. To address this, we present efficient post-processing algorithms to improve citation accuracy in LLM-generated responses, with minimal impact on latency and cost. Our approaches cross-check generated citations against retrieved articles using methods including keyword + semantic matching, fine tuned model with BERTScore, and a lightweight LLM-based technique. Our experimental results demonstrate a relative improvement of 15.46% in the overall accuracy metrics of our RAG system. This significant enhancement potentially enables a shift from our current larger language model to a relatively smaller model that is approximately 12x more cost-effective and 3x faster in inference time, while maintaining comparable performance. This research contributes to enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of AI-generated content in information retrieval and summarization tasks which is critical to gain customer trust especially in commercial products.</p></details> |  |

A crucial factor in RAG evaluation is "support", whether the information in the cited documents supports the answer. To this end, we conducted a large-scale comparative study of 45 participant submissions on 36 topics to the TREC 2024 RAG Track, comparing an automatic LLM judge (GPT-4o) against human judges for support assessment. We considered two conditions: (1) fully manual assessments from scratch and (2) manual assessments with post-editing of LLM predictions. Our results indicate that for 56% of the manual from-scratch assessments, human and GPT-4o predictions match perfectly (on a three-level scale), increasing to 72% in the manual with post-editing condition. Furthermore, by carefully analyzing the disagreements in an unbiased study, we found that an independent human judge correlates better with GPT-4o than a human judge, suggesting that LLM judges can be a reliable alternative for support assessment. To conclude, we provide a qualitative analysis of human and GPT-4o errors to help guide future iterations of support assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGIR 2025 (short)</p></details> |
| **[The Great Nugget Recall: Automating Fact Extraction and RAG Evaluation with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15068v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced the capabilities of information access systems, especially with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Nevertheless, the evaluation of RAG systems remains a barrier to continued progress, a challenge we tackle in this work by proposing an automatic evaluation framework that is validated against human annotations. We believe that the nugget evaluation methodology provides a solid foundation for evaluating RAG systems. This approach, originally developed for the TREC Question Answering (QA) Track in 2003, evaluates systems based on atomic facts that should be present in good answers. Our efforts focus on "refactoring" this methodology, where we describe the AutoNuggetizer framework that specifically applies LLMs to both automatically create nuggets and automatically assign nuggets to system answers. In the context of the TREC 2024 RAG Track, we calibrate a fully automatic approach against strategies where nuggets are created manually or semi-manually by human assessors and then assigned manually to system answers. Based on results from a community-wide evaluation, we observe strong agreement at the run level between scores derived from fully automatic nugget evaluation and human-based variants. The agreement is stronger when individual framework components such as nugget assignment are automated independently. This suggests that our evaluation framework provides tradeoffs between effort and quality that can be used to guide the development of future RAG systems. However, further research is necessary to refine our approach, particularly in establishing robust per-topic agreement to diagnose system failures effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in SIGIR 2025.

| **[AlignRAG: An Adaptable Framework for Resolving Misalignments in Retrieval-Aware Reasoning of RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14858v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a foundational paradigm for knowledge-grounded text generation. However, existing RAG pipelines often fail to ensure that the reasoning trajectories align with the evidential constraints imposed by retrieved content. In this paper, we reframe RAG as a problem of retrieval-aware reasoning and identify a core challenge: reasoning misalignment-the mismatch between a model's reasoning trajectory and the retrieved evidence. To address this challenge, we propose AlignRAG, a novel test-time framework that mitigates reasoning misalignment through iterative Critique-Driven Alignment (CDA) steps. In contrast to prior approaches that rely on static training or post-hoc selection, AlignRAG actively refines reasoning trajectories during inference by enforcing fine-grained alignment with evidence. Our framework introduces a new paradigm for retrieval-aware reasoning by: (1) constructing context-rich training corpora; (2) generating contrastive critiques from preference-aware reasoning trajectories; (3) training a dedicated \textit{Critic Language Model (CLM)} to identify reasoning misalignments; and (4) applying CDA steps to optimize reasoning trajectories iteratively. Empirical results demonstrate that AlignRAG consistently outperforms all baselines and could integrate as a plug-and-play module into existing RAG pipelines without further changes. By reconceptualizing RAG as a structured reasoning trajectory and establishing the test-time framework for correcting reasoning misalignments in RAG, AlignRAG provides practical advancements for retrieval-aware generation.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we develop an efficient bilingual question-answering framework for regulatory documents, specifically the Bangladesh Police Gazettes, which contain both English and Bangla text. Our approach employs modern Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines to enhance information retrieval and response generation. In addition to conventional RAG pipelines, we propose an advanced RAG-based approach that improves retrieval performance, leading to more precise answers. This system enables efficient searching for specific government legal notices, making legal information more accessible. We evaluate both our proposed and conventional RAG systems on a diverse test set on Bangladesh Police Gazettes, demonstrating that our approach consistently outperforms existing methods across all evaluation metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IJCNN 2025</p></details> |

Unlike traditional vulnerabilities, these packages are intentionally designed to deceive users, making detection challenging due to evolving attack methods and the lack of structured datasets. In this work, we empirically evaluate the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and few-shot learning for detecting malicious source code. We fine-tune LLMs on curated datasets and integrate YARA rules, GitHub Security Advisories, and malicious code snippets with the aim of enhancing classification accuracy. We came across a counterintuitive outcome: While RAG is expected to boost up the prediction performance, it fails in the performed evaluation, obtaining a mediocre accuracy. In contrast, few-shot learning is more effective as it significantly improves the detection of malicious code, achieving 97% accuracy and 95% balanced accuracy, outperforming traditional RAG approaches. Thus, future work should expand structured knowledge bases, refine retrieval models, and explore hybrid AI-driven cybersecurity solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been peer-reviewed and accepted for publication to the 29th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE 2025)</p></details> |

Given a user query, RAG pipelines typically first retrieve (R) relevant information from external sources, before invoking a Large Language Model (LLM), augmented (A) with this information, to generate (G) responses. Modern RAG pipelines frequently chain multiple retrieval and generation components, in any order. However, developing effective RAG pipelines is challenging because retrieval and generation components are intertwined, making it hard to identify which component(s) cause errors in the eventual output. The parameters with the greatest impact on output quality often require hours of pre-processing after each change, creating prohibitively slow feedback cycles. To address these challenges, we present RAGGY, a developer tool that combines a Python library of composable RAG primitives with an interactive interface for real-time debugging. We contribute the design and implementation of RAGGY, insights into expert debugging patterns through a qualitative study with 12 engineers, and design implications for future RAG tools that better align with developers' natural workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

When relevant internal documents are unavailable, the system struggles to generate accurate and complete responses. Additionally, using closed-source Large Language Models (LLMs) raises concerns about exposing proprietary information. To address these issues, we propose the Secure Multifaceted-RAG (SecMulti-RAG) framework, which retrieves not only from internal documents but also from two supplementary sources: pre-generated expert knowledge for anticipated queries and on-demand external LLM-generated knowledge. To mitigate security risks, we adopt a local open-source generator and selectively utilize external LLMs only when prompts are deemed safe by a filtering mechanism. This approach enhances completeness, prevents data leakage, and reduces costs. In our evaluation on a report generation task in the automotive industry, SecMulti-RAG significantly outperforms traditional RAG - achieving 79.3 to 91.9 percent win rates across correctness, richness, and helpfulness in LLM-based evaluation, and 56.3 to 70.4 percent in human evaluation. This highlights SecMulti-RAG as a practical and secure solution for enterprise RAG.</p></details> |  |

However, deploying RAG on consumer-grade platforms is challenging due to limited memory and the increasing scale of both models and knowledge bases. In this work, we introduce RAGDoll, a resource-efficient, self-adaptive RAG serving system integrated with LLMs, specifically designed for resource-constrained platforms. RAGDoll exploits the insight that RAG retrieval and LLM generation impose different computational and memory demands, which in a traditional serial workflow result in substantial idle times and poor resource utilization. Based on this insight, RAGDoll decouples retrieval and generation into parallel pipelines, incorporating joint memory placement and dynamic batch scheduling strategies to optimize resource usage across diverse hardware devices and workloads. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAGDoll adapts effectively to various hardware configurations and LLM scales, achieving up to 3.6 times speedup in average latency compared to serial RAG systems based on vLLM.</p></details> |  |

This advancement has enabled their widespread deployment across sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and enterprise applications. RAG mitigates hallucinations by integrating external knowledge, yet introduces privacy risk and security risk, notably data breaching risk and data poisoning risk. While recent studies have explored prompt injection and poisoning attacks, there remains a significant gap in comprehensive research on controlling inbound and outbound query flows to mitigate these threats. In this paper, we propose an AI firewall, ControlNET, designed to safeguard RAG-based LLM systems from these vulnerabilities. ControlNET controls query flows by leveraging activation shift phenomena to detect adversarial queries and mitigate their impact through semantic divergence. We conduct comprehensive experiments on four different benchmark datasets including Msmarco, HotpotQA, FinQA, and MedicalSys using state-of-the-art open source LLMs (Llama3, Vicuna, and Mistral). Our results demonstrate that ControlNET achieves over 0.909 AUROC in detecting and mitigating security threats while preserving system harmlessness. Overall, ControlNET offers an effective, robust, harmless defense mechanism, marking a significant advancement toward the secure deployment of RAG-based LLM systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://ai.zjuicsr.cn/firewall</p></details> |

However, they also exhibit inherent limitations, such as outdated knowledge and susceptibility to hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm to address these issues, but it also introduces new vulnerabilities. Recent efforts have focused on the security of RAG-based LLMs, yet existing attack methods face three critical challenges: (1) their effectiveness declines sharply when only a limited number of poisoned texts can be injected into the knowledge database, (2) they lack sufficient stealth, as the attacks are often detectable by anomaly detection systems, which compromises their effectiveness, and (3) they rely on heuristic approaches to generate poisoned texts, lacking formal optimization frameworks and theoretic guarantees, which limits their effectiveness and applicability. To address these issues, we propose coordinated Prompt-RAG attack (PR-attack), a novel optimization-driven attack that introduces a small number of poisoned texts into the knowledge database while embedding a backdoor trigger within the prompt. When activated, the trigger causes the LLM to generate pre-designed responses to targeted queries, while maintaining normal behavior in other contexts. This ensures both high effectiveness and stealth. We formulate the attack generation process as a bilevel optimization problem leveraging a principled optimization framework to develop optimal poisoned texts and triggers. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PR-Attack, achieving a high attack success rate even with a limited number of poisoned texts and significantly improved stealth compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGIR 2025</p></details> |
| **[ARCeR: an Agentic RAG for the Automated Definition of Cyber Ranges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12143v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing and evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats necessitates the development of supporting tools and platforms that allow for the creation of realistic IT environments operating within virtual, controlled settings as Cyber Ranges (CRs). CRs can be exploited for analyzing vulnerabilities and experimenting with the effectiveness of devised countermeasures, as well as serving as training environments for building cyber security skills and abilities for IT operators. This paper proposes ARCeR as an innovative solution for the automatic generation and deployment of CRs, starting from user-provided descriptions in a natural language. ARCeR relies on the Agentic RAG paradigm, which allows it to fully exploit state-of-art AI technologies. Experimental results show that ARCeR is able to successfully process prompts even in cases that LLMs or basic RAG systems are not able to cope with. Furthermore, ARCeR is able to target any CR framework provided that specific knowledge is made available to it.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Visual RAG Pipeline for Few-Shot Fine-Grained Product Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11838v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the rapid evolution of learning and computer vision algorithms, Fine-Grained Classification (FGC) still poses an open problem in many practically relevant applications. In the retail domain, for example, the identification of fast changing and visually highly similar products and their properties are key to automated price-monitoring and product recommendation. This paper presents a novel Visual RAG pipeline that combines the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach and Vision Language Models (VLMs) for few-shot FGC. This Visual RAG pipeline extracts product and promotion data in advertisement leaflets from various retailers and simultaneously predicts fine-grained product ids along with price and discount information. Compared to previous approaches, the key characteristic of the Visual RAG pipeline is that it allows the prediction of novel products without re-training, simply by adding a few class samples to the RAG database. Comparing several VLM back-ends like GPT-4o [23], GPT-4o-mini [24], and Gemini 2.0 Flash [10], our approach achieves 86.8% accuracy on a diverse dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Shared Disk KV Cache Management for Efficient Multi-Instance Inference in RAG-Powered LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11765v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent large language models (LLMs) face increasing inference latency as input context length and model size continue to grow. In particular, the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique, which enhances LLM responses by incorporating external knowledge, exacerbates this issue by significantly increasing the number of input tokens. This expansion in token length leads to a substantial rise in computational overhead, particularly during the prefill stage, resulting in prolonged time-to-first-token (TTFT). To address this issue, this paper proposes a method to reduce TTFT by leveraging a disk-based key-value (KV) cache to lessen the computational burden during the prefill stage. We also introduce a disk-based shared KV cache management system, called Shared RAG-DCache, for multi-instance LLM RAG service environments. This system, together with an optimal system configuration, improves both throughput and latency under given resource constraints. Shared RAG-DCache exploits the locality of documents related to user queries in RAG, as well as the queueing delay in LLM inference services. It proactively generates and stores disk KV caches for query-related documents and shares them across multiple LLM instances to enhance inference performance. In experiments on a single host equipped with 2 GPUs and 1 CPU, Shared RAG-DCache achieved a 15~71% increase in throughput and up to a 12~65% reduction in latency, depending on the resource configuration.</p></details> |  |
| **[NodeRAG: Structuring Graph-based RAG with Heterogeneous Nodes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11544v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) empowers large language models to access external and private corpus, enabling factually consistent responses in specific domains. By exploiting the inherent structure of the corpus, graph-based RAG methods further enrich this process by building a knowledge graph index and leveraging the structural nature of graphs. However, current graph-based RAG approaches seldom prioritize the design of graph structures. Inadequately designed graph not only impede the seamless integration of diverse graph algorithms but also result in workflow inconsistencies and degraded performance. To further unleash the potential of graph for RAG, we propose NodeRAG, a graph-centric framework introducing heterogeneous graph structures that enable the seamless and holistic integration of graph-based methodologies into the RAG workflow. By aligning closely with the capabilities of LLMs, this framework ensures a fully cohesive and efficient end-to-end process. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that NodeRAG exhibits performance advantages over previous methods, including GraphRAG and LightRAG, not only in indexing time, query time, and storage efficiency but also in delivering superior question-answering performance on multi-hop benchmarks and open-ended head-to-head evaluations with minimal retrieval tokens.

| **[Towards Automated Safety Requirements Derivation Using Agent-based RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11243v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the automated derivation of safety requirements in a self-driving vehicle use case, leveraging LLMs in combination with agent-based retrieval-augmented generation. Conventional approaches that utilise pre-trained LLMs to assist in safety analyses typically lack domain-specific knowledge. Existing RAG approaches address this issue, yet their performance deteriorates when handling complex queries and it becomes increasingly harder to retrieve the most relevant information. This is particularly relevant for safety-relevant applications. In this paper, we propose the use of agent-based RAG to derive safety requirements and show that the retrieved information is more relevant to the queries. We implement an agent-based approach on a document pool of automotive standards and the Apollo case study, as a representative example of an automated driving perception system. Our solution is tested on a data set of safety requirement questions and answers, extracted from the Apollo data. Evaluating a set of selected RAG metrics, we present and discuss advantages of a agent-based approach compared to default RAG methods.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |
| **[SlowFastVAD: Video Anomaly Detection via Integrating Simple Detector and RAG-Enhanced Vision-Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10320v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) aims to identify unexpected events in videos and has wide applications in safety-critical domains. While semi-supervised methods trained on only normal samples have gained traction, they often suffer from high false alarm rates and poor interpretability. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong multimodal reasoning capabilities, offering new opportunities for explainable anomaly detection. However, their high computational cost and lack of domain adaptation hinder real-time deployment and reliability. Inspired by dual complementary pathways in human visual perception, we propose SlowFastVAD, a hybrid framework that integrates a fast anomaly detector with a slow anomaly detector (namely a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) enhanced VLM), to address these limitations. Specifically, the fast detector first provides coarse anomaly confidence scores, and only a small subset of ambiguous segments, rather than the entire video, is further analyzed by the slower yet more interpretable VLM for elaborate detection and reasoning. Furthermore, to adapt VLMs to domain-specific VAD scenarios, we construct a knowledge base including normal patterns based on few normal samples and abnormal patterns inferred by VLMs. During inference, relevant patterns are retrieved and used to augment prompts for anomaly reasoning. Finally, we smoothly fuse the anomaly confidence of fast and slow detectors to enhance robustness of anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that SlowFastVAD effectively combines the strengths of both fast and slow detectors, and achieves remarkable detection accuracy and interpretability with significantly reduced computational overhead, making it well-suited for real-world VAD applications with high reliability requirements.</p></details> |  |

Recent research has increasingly concentrated on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks and their evolution into more advanced agent-based architectures within personalized settings to enhance user satisfaction. Building on this foundation, this survey systematically examines personalization across the three core stages of RAG: pre-retrieval, retrieval, and generation. Beyond RAG, we further extend its capabilities into the realm of Personalized LLM-based Agents, which enhance traditional RAG systems with agentic functionalities, including user understanding, personalized planning and execution, and dynamic generation. For both personalization in RAG and agent-based personalization, we provide formal definitions, conduct a comprehensive review of recent literature, and summarize key datasets and evaluation metrics. Additionally, we discuss fundamental challenges, limitations, and promising research directions in this evolving field.

| **[RAG-Based Fuzzing of Cross-Architecture Compilers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08967v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>OneAPI is an open standard that supports cross-architecture software development with minimal effort from developers. It brings DPC++ and C++ compilers which need to be thoroughly tested to verify their correctness, reliability, and security. Compilers have numerous code flows and optimization features. This process requires developers with deep understanding of the different compiler flows to craft testcases specific to target paths in the compiler. This testcase creation is a time-consuming and costly process. In this paper, we propose a large-language model (LLM)-based compiler fuzzing tool that integrates the concept of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). This tool automates the testcase generation task and relieves experienced compiler developers from investing time to craft testcase generation patterns. We test our proposed approach on the Intel DPC++/C++ compiler. This compiler compiles SYCL code and allows developers to offload it to different architectures, e.g. GPUs and CPUs from different vendors. Using this tool, we managed to identify 87 SYCL code test cases that lead to output value mismatch or compiler runtime errors when compiled using Intel DPC++ and clang++ compilers and run on different architectures. The testcases and the identified unexpected behaviors of the compilers under test were obtained within only few hours with no prior background on the compiler passes under tests. This tool facilitates efficient compiler fuzzing with reduced developer time requirements via the dynamic testcase creation capability provided by an LLM with RAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Adaptive Vector Index Partitioning Scheme for Low-Latency RAG Pipeline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08930v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance response quality by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with vector databases, enabling external knowledge retrieval to support language model reasoning. While RAG enables efficient question answering with smaller LLMs, existing optimizations for vector search and LLM serving have largely been developed in isolation. As a result, their integration often leads to suboptimal end-to-end performance. ... This paper introduces VectorLiteRAG, an optimized vector index partitioning mechanism designed for RAG systems that enhances the responsiveness of the system by jointly optimizing vector search and LLM serving across CPU and GPU system. A key challenge is to determine which indices and how much of the vector index should reside on the GPU and adjusting LLM batch sizes to balance the pipeline for lower Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and meeting user-defined Service-Level Objectives (SLOs). To address this, we leverage the insight that cluster access in vector databases exhibits access skew, where a subset of clusters are queried significantly more frequently than others. VectorLiteRAG exploits this property through an optimized memory distribution strategy, dynamically allocating the minimum number of vector indices corresponding to frequently accessed clusters onto the GPU HBM to ensure a balanced pipeline with the LLM for high responsiveness. This adaptive partitioning scheme is guided by a statistical model that informs memory allocation and workload distribution. Our evaluation demonstrates that VectorLiteRAG improves vector search responsiveness by 2x, significantly reduces end-to-end TTFT in RAG systems by intelligently balancing memory resources between vector search and LLM execution.</p></details> |  |

This presents a critical gap for practical deployment, where user queries exhibit greater linguistic variations and can trigger cascading errors across interdependent RAG components. In this work, we systematically analyze how varying four linguistic dimensions (formality, readability, politeness, and grammatical correctness) impact RAG performance. We evaluate two retrieval models and nine LLMs, ranging from 3 to 72 billion parameters, across four information-seeking Question Answering (QA) datasets. Our results reveal that linguistic reformulations significantly impact both retrieval and generation stages, leading to a relative performance drop of up to 40.41% in Recall@5 scores for less formal queries and 38.86% in answer match scores for queries containing grammatical errors. Notably, RAG systems exhibit greater sensitivity to such variations compared to LLM-only generations, highlighting their vulnerability to error propagation due to linguistic shifts. These findings highlight the need for improved robustness techniques to enhance reliability in diverse user interactions.</p></details> |  |

Given the overwhelming volume and inherent complexity of scientific collections, conventional search systems often lack necessary intuitiveness and interactivity, presenting substantial barriers for learners, educators, and researchers. CollEx addresses these limitations by employing state-of-the-art Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) as multimodal agents accessible through an intuitive chat interface. By abstracting complex interactions via specialized agents equipped with advanced tools, CollEx facilitates curiosity-driven exploration, significantly simplifying access to diverse scientific collections and records therein. Our system integrates textual and visual modalities, supporting educational scenarios that are helpful for teachers, pupils, students, and researchers by fostering independent exploration as well as scientific excitement and curiosity. Furthermore, CollEx serves the research community by discovering interdisciplinary connections and complementing visual data. We illustrate the effectiveness of our system through a proof-of-concept application containing over 64,000 unique records across 32 collections from a local scientific collection from a public university.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging LLMs for Utility-Focused Annotation: Reducing Manual Effort for Retrieval and RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05220v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval models typically rely on costly human-labeled query-document relevance annotations for training and evaluation. To reduce this cost and leverage the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in relevance judgments, we aim to explore whether LLM-generated annotations can effectively replace human annotations in training retrieval models. Retrieval usually emphasizes relevance, which indicates "topic-relatedness" of a document to a query, while in RAG, the value of a document (or utility) depends on how it contributes to answer generation. Recognizing this mismatch, some researchers use LLM performance on downstream tasks with documents as labels, but this approach requires manual answers for specific tasks, leading to high costs and limited generalization. In another line of work, prompting LLMs to select useful documents as RAG references eliminates the need for human annotation and is not task-specific. If we leverage LLMs' utility judgments to annotate retrieval data, we may retain cross-task generalization without human annotation in large-scale corpora. Therefore, we investigate utility-focused annotation via LLMs for large-scale retriever training data across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings on the retrieval and RAG tasks. To reduce the impact of low-quality positives labeled by LLMs, we design a novel loss function, i.e., Disj-InfoNCE. Our experiments reveal that: (1) Retrievers trained on utility-focused annotations significantly outperform those trained on human annotations in the out-of-domain setting on both tasks, demonstrating superior generalization capabilities. (2) LLM annotation does not replace human annotation in the in-domain setting. However, incorporating just 20% human-annotated data enables retrievers trained with utility-focused annotations to match the performance of models trained entirely with human annotations.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Diversity Enhances an LLM's Performance in RAG and Long-context Task](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09017v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the challenge of context window limitations, primarily due to the quadratic time complexity of the self-attention mechanism (\(O(N^2)\), where \(N\) denotes the context window length). This constraint impacts tasks such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in question answering (Q\&A) and long context summarization. A common approach involves selecting content with the highest similarity to the query; however, this often leads to redundancy and the exclusion of diverse yet relevant information. Building on principles from Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) and Farthest Point Sampling (FPS), we integrate diversity into the content selection process. Our findings reveal that incorporating diversity substantially increases the recall of selecting relevant sentences or chunks before LLM-based Q\&A and summarization. These results highlight the importance of maintaining diversity in future LLM applications to further improve summarization and Q\&A outcomes.</p></details> |  |

While hierarchical planning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) address some of these challenges, they remain insufficient on their own and a deeper integration is required for achieving more reliable systems. To this end, we propose a neuro-symbolic approach that enhances LLMs-based planners with Knowledge Graph-based RAG for hierarchical plan generation. This method decomposes complex tasks into manageable subtasks, further expanded into executable atomic action sequences. To ensure formal correctness and proper decomposition, we integrate a Symbolic Validator, which also functions as a failure detector by aligning expected and observed world states. Our evaluation against baseline methods demonstrates the consistent significant advantages of integrating hierarchical planning, symbolic verification, and RAG across tasks of varying complexity and different LLMs. Additionally, our experimental setup and novel metrics not only validate our approach for complex planning but also serve as a tool for assessing LLMs' reasoning and compositional capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Accurate and efficient scenario data search is critical for both online vehicle decision-making and planning, and offline scenario generation and simulations, as it allows for leveraging the scenario experiences to improve the overall performance. Especially with the application of large language models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) systems in autonomous driving, urgent requirements are put forward. In this paper, we introduce the Driving-RAG framework to address the challenges of efficient scenario data embedding, search, and applications for RAG systems. Our embedding model aligns fundamental scenario information and scenario distance metrics in the vector space. The typical scenario sampling method combined with hierarchical navigable small world can perform efficient scenario vector search to achieve high efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. In addition, the reorganization mechanism by graph knowledge enhances the relevance to the prompt scenarios and augment LLM generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on typical trajectory planning task for complex interactive scenarios such as ramps and intersections, showcasing its advantages for RAG applications.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel perspective on software testing by positing bug detection and coding with fewer bugs as two interconnected problems that share a common goal, which is reducing bugs with limited resources. We extend our previous work on AI-assisted programming, which supports code auto-completion and chatbot-powered Q&A, to the realm of software testing. We introduce Copilot for Testing, an automated testing system that synchronizes bug detection with codebase updates, leveraging context-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Our evaluation demonstrates a 31.2% improvement in bug detection accuracy, a 12.6% increase in critical test coverage, and a 10.5% higher user acceptance rate, highlighting the transformative potential of AI-driven technologies in modern software development practices.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for publication in IEEE Software (DOI: 10.1109/MS.2025.3549628)</p></details> |

Producing such semantic co-speech gestures has been a major challenge for the existing neural systems that can generate rhythmic beat gestures, but struggle to produce semantically meaningful gestures. Therefore, we present RAG-Gesture, a diffusion-based gesture generation approach that leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce natural-looking and semantically rich gestures. Our neuro-explicit gesture generation approach is designed to produce semantic gestures grounded in interpretable linguistic knowledge. We achieve this by using explicit domain knowledge to retrieve exemplar motions from a database of co-speech gestures. Once retrieved, we then inject these semantic exemplar gestures into our diffusion-based gesture generation pipeline using DDIM inversion and retrieval guidance at the inference time without any need of training. Further, we propose a control paradigm for guidance, that allows the users to modulate the amount of influence each retrieval insertion has over the generated sequence. Our comparative evaluations demonstrate the validity of our approach against recent gesture generation approaches. The reader is urged to explore the results on our project page.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

| **[CacheBlend: Fast Large Language Model Serving for RAG with Cached Knowledge Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16444v3)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often incorporate multiple text chunks in their inputs to provide the necessary contexts. To speed up the prefill of the long LLM inputs, one can pre-compute the KV cache of a text and re-use the KV cache when the context is reused as the prefix of another LLM input. However, the reused text chunks are not always the input prefix, which makes precomputed KV caches not directly usable since they ignore the text's cross-attention with the preceding texts. Thus, the benefits of reusing KV caches remain largely unrealized. This paper tackles just one challenge: when an LLM input contains multiple text chunks, how to quickly combine their precomputed KV caches in order to achieve the same generation quality as the expensive full prefill (i.e., without reusing KV cache)? This challenge naturally arises in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) where the input is supplemented with multiple retrieved texts as the context. We present CacheBlend, a scheme that reuses the precomputed KV caches, regardless prefix or not, and selectively recomputes the KV values of a small subset of tokens to partially update each reused KV cache. In the meantime, the small extra delay for recomputing some tokens can be pipelined with the retrieval of KV caches within the same job, allowing CacheBlend to store KV caches in slower devices with more storage capacity while retrieving them without increasing the inference delay. By comparing CacheBlend with the state-of-the-art KV cache reusing schemes on three open-source LLMs of various sizes and four popular benchmark datasets of different tasks, we show that CacheBlend reduces time-to-first-token (TTFT) by 2.2-3.3x and increases the inference throughput by 2.8-5x from full KV recompute without compromising generation quality.

In real-world scenarios, user questions often require retrieving answers that are distributed across multiple tables. GraphRAG has recently attracted much attention for enhancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities by organizing external knowledge to address ad-hoc and complex questions, exemplifying a promising direction for cross-table question answering. In this paper, to address the current gap in available data, we first introduce a multi-table benchmark, MutliTableQA, comprising 60k tables and 25k user queries collected from real-world sources. Then, we propose the first Graph-Table-RAG framework, namely GTR, which reorganizes table corpora into a heterogeneous graph, employs a hierarchical coarse-to-fine retrieval process to extract the most relevant tables, and integrates graph-aware prompting for downstream LLMs' tabular reasoning. Extensive experiments show that GTR exhibits superior cross-table question-answering performance while maintaining high deployment efficiency, demonstrating its real-world practical applicability.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Beyond Quacking: Deep Integration of Language Models and RAG into DuckDB](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01157v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge-intensive analytical applications retrieve context from both structured tabular data and unstructured, text-free documents for effective decision-making. Large language models (LLMs) have made it significantly easier to prototype such retrieval and reasoning data pipelines. However, implementing these pipelines efficiently still demands significant effort and has several challenges. This often involves orchestrating heterogeneous data systems, managing data movement, and handling low-level implementation details, e.g., LLM context management. To address these challenges, we introduce FlockMTL: an extension for DBMSs that deeply integrates LLM capabilities and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). FlockMTL includes model-driven scalar and aggregate functions, enabling chained predictions through tuple-level mappings and reductions. Drawing inspiration from the relational model, FlockMTL incorporates: (i) cost-based optimizations, which seamlessly apply techniques such as batching and caching; and (ii) resource independence, enabled through novel SQL DDL abstractions: PROMPT and MODEL, introduced as first-class schema objects alongside TABLE. FlockMTL streamlines the development of knowledge-intensive analytical applications, and its optimizations ease the implementation burden.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Routing RAG: Binding Selective Retrieval with Knowledge Verbalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01018v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Selective retrieval improves retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by reducing distractions from low-quality retrievals and improving efficiency. However, existing approaches under-utilize the inherent knowledge of large language models (LLMs), leading to suboptimal retrieval decisions and degraded generation performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Self-Routing RAG (SR-RAG), a novel framework that binds selective retrieval with knowledge verbalization. SR-RAG enables an LLM to dynamically decide between external retrieval and verbalizing its own parametric knowledge. To this end, we design a multi-task objective that jointly optimizes an LLM on knowledge source selection, knowledge verbalization, and response generation. We further introduce dynamic knowledge source inference via nearest neighbor search to improve the accuracy of knowledge source decision under domain shifts. Fine-tuning three LLMs with SR-RAG significantly improves both their response accuracy and inference latency. Compared to the strongest selective retrieval baseline, SR-RAG reduces retrievals by 29% while improving the performance by 5.1%.</p></details> | Work in Progress |
| **[TOBUGraph: Knowledge Graph-Based Retrieval for Enhanced LLM Performance Beyond RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05447v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is one of the leading and most widely used techniques for enhancing LLM retrieval capabilities, but it still faces significant limitations in commercial use cases. RAG primarily relies on the query-chunk text-to-text similarity in the embedding space for retrieval and can fail to capture deeper semantic relationships across chunks, is highly sensitive to chunking strategies, and is prone to hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose TOBUGraph, a graph-based retrieval framework that first constructs the knowledge graph from unstructured data dynamically and automatically. Using LLMs, TOBUGraph extracts structured knowledge and diverse relationships among data, going beyond RAG's text-to-text similarity. Retrieval is achieved through graph traversal, leveraging the extracted relationships and structures to enhance retrieval accuracy, eliminating the need for chunking configurations while reducing hallucination. We demonstrate TOBUGraph's effectiveness in TOBU, a real-world application in production for personal memory organization and retrieval. Our evaluation using real user data demonstrates that TOBUGraph outperforms multiple RAG implementations in both precision and recall, significantly improving user experience through improved retrieval accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contradiction Detection in RAG Systems: Evaluating LLMs as Context Validators for Improved Information Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00180v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have emerged as a powerful method for enhancing large language models (LLMs) with up-to-date information. However, the retrieval step in RAG can sometimes surface documents containing contradictory information, particularly in rapidly evolving domains such as news. These contradictions can significantly impact the performance of LLMs, leading to inconsistent or erroneous outputs. This study addresses this critical challenge in two ways. First, we present a novel data generation framework to simulate different types of contradictions that may occur in the retrieval stage of a RAG system. Second, we evaluate the robustness of different LLMs in performing as context validators, assessing their ability to detect contradictory information within retrieved document sets. Our experimental results reveal that context validation remains a challenging task even for state-of-the-art LLMs, with performance varying significantly across different types of contradictions. While larger models generally perform better at contradiction detection, the effectiveness of different prompting strategies varies across tasks and model architectures. We find that chain-of-thought prompting shows notable improvements for some models but may hinder performance in others, highlighting the complexity of the task and the need for more robust approaches to context validation in RAG systems.</p></details> |  |

Using LLaMA 3, we evaluate these approaches on emotion classification and mental health condition detection tasks across two datasets. Fine-tuning achieves the highest accuracy (91% for emotion classification, 80% for mental health conditions) but requires substantial computational resources and large training sets, while prompt engineering and RAG offer more flexible deployment with moderate performance (40-68% accuracy). Our findings provide practical insights for implementing LLM-based solutions in mental health applications, highlighting the trade-offs between accuracy, computational requirements, and deployment flexibility.</p></details> |  |

A robust benchmark dataset must satisfy three key criteria: quality, diversity, and difficulty, which capturing the complexity of reasoning based on hops and the distribution of supporting evidence. In this paper, we propose MHTS (Multi-Hop Tree Structure), a novel dataset synthesis framework that systematically controls multi-hop reasoning complexity by leveraging a multi-hop tree structure to generate logically connected, multi-chunk queries. Our fine-grained difficulty estimation formula exhibits a strong correlation with the overall performance metrics of a RAG system, validating its effectiveness in assessing both retrieval and answer generation capabilities. By ensuring high-quality, diverse, and difficulty-controlled queries, our approach enhances RAG evaluation and benchmarking capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Systematic Knowledge Injection into Large Language Models via Diverse Augmentation for Domain-Specific RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08356v3)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a prominent method for incorporating domain knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs). While RAG enhances response relevance by incorporating retrieved domain knowledge in the context, retrieval errors can still lead to hallucinations and incorrect answers. To recover from retriever failures, domain knowledge is injected by fine-tuning the model to generate the correct response, even in the case of retrieval errors. However, we observe that without systematic knowledge augmentation, fine-tuned LLMs may memorize new information but still fail to extract relevant domain knowledge, leading to poor performance. In this work, we present a novel framework that significantly enhances the fine-tuning process by augmenting the training data in two ways -- context augmentation and knowledge paraphrasing. In context augmentation, we create multiple training samples for a given QA pair by varying the relevance of the retrieved information, teaching the model when to ignore and when to rely on retrieved content. In knowledge paraphrasing, we fine-tune with multiple answers to the same question, enabling LLMs to better internalize specialized knowledge. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting due to fine-tuning, we add a domain-specific identifier to a question and also utilize a replay buffer containing general QA pairs. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our method over existing techniques, achieving up to 10\% relative gain in token-level recall while preserving the LLM's generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 14 tables, to be published in NAACL 2025</p></details> |

Evaluating Fairness in Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19804v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has recently gained significant attention for its enhanced ability to integrate external knowledge sources into open-domain question answering (QA) tasks. However, it remains unclear how these models address fairness concerns, particularly with respect to sensitive attributes such as gender, geographic location, and other demographic factors. First, as language models evolve to prioritize utility, like improving exact match accuracy, fairness considerations may have been largely overlooked. Second, the complex, multi-component architecture of RAG methods poses challenges in identifying and mitigating biases, as each component is optimized for distinct objectives. In this paper, we aim to empirically evaluate fairness in several RAG methods. We propose a fairness evaluation framework tailored to RAG, using scenario-based questions and analyzing disparities across demographic attributes. Our experimental results indicate that, despite recent advances in utility-driven optimization, fairness issues persist in both the retrieval and generation stages. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions to address fairness concerns throughout the RAG pipeline.

To enrich the RAG context, we propose providing Large Language Models (LLMs) with author-specific features, such as average sentiment polarity and frequently used words, in addition to past samples from the author's profile. We introduce a new feature called Contrastive Examples: documents from other authors are retrieved to help LLM identify what makes an author's style unique in comparison to others. Our experiments show that adding a couple of sentences about the named entities, dependency patterns, and words a person uses frequently significantly improves personalized text generation. Combining features with contrastive examples boosts the performance further, achieving a relative 15% improvement over baseline RAG while outperforming the benchmarks. Our results show the value of fine-grained features for better personalization, while opening a new research dimension for including contrastive examples as a complement with RAG. We release our code publicly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Balancing Content Size in RAG-Text2SQL System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15723v3)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising solution for converting natural language queries into SQL commands, enabling seamless database interaction. However, these Text-to-SQL (Text2SQL) systems face inherent limitations, hallucinations, outdated knowledge, and untraceable reasoning. To address these challenges, the integration of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with Text2SQL models has gained traction. RAG serves as a retrieval mechanism, providing essential contextual information, such as table schemas and metadata, to enhance the query generation process. Despite their potential, RAG + Text2SQL systems are susceptible to the quality and size of retrieved documents. While richer document content can improve schema relevance and retrieval accuracy, it also introduces noise, increasing the risk of hallucinations and reducing query fidelity as the prompt size of the Text2SQL model increases. This research investigates the nuanced trade-off between document size and quality, aiming to strike a balance that optimizes system performance. Key thresholds are identified where performance degradation occurs, along with actionable strategies to mitigate these challenges. Additionally, we explore the phenomenon of hallucinations in Text2SQL models, emphasizing the critical role of curated document presentation in minimizing errors. Our findings provide a roadmap for enhancing the robustness of RAG + Text2SQL systems, offering practical insights for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

We propose a dynamic retrieval gating mechanism coupled with expert routing, enabling the model to selectively consult an external knowledge store or rely on specialized internal experts based on the query's needs. The paper lays out the theoretical foundations of ExpertRAG, including a probabilistic formulation that treats retrieval and expert selection as latent decisions, and mathematical justifications for its efficiency in both computation and knowledge utilization. We derive formulae to quantify the expected computational cost savings from selective retrieval and the capacity gains from sparse expert utilization. A comparative analysis positions ExpertRAG against standard RAG (with always-on retrieval) and pure MoE models (e.g., Switch Transformer, Mixtral) to highlight its unique balance between parametric knowledge and non-parametric retrieval. We also outline an experimental validation strategy, proposing benchmarks and evaluation protocols to test ExpertRAG's performance on factual recall, generalization, and inference efficiency. The proposed framework, although presented theoretically, is supported by insights from prior work in RAG and MoE, and is poised to provide more factual, efficient, and adaptive generation by leveraging the best of both paradigms. In summary, ExpertRAG contributes a new perspective on scaling and augmenting language models, backed by a thorough analysis and a roadmap for empirical validation.</p></details> | 30 pages, 4 figures |

The two mainstream solutions to incorporate memory into the generation process are long-context LLMs and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). In this paper, we first systematically compare these two types of solutions on three renovated/new datasets and show that (1) long-context solutions, although more expensive, shall be easier to capture the big picture and better answer queries which require considering the memory as a whole; and (2) when the queries concern specific information, RAG solutions shall be more competitive especially when the keywords can be explicitly matched. Therefore, we propose a novel method RAG-Tuned-LLM which fine-tunes a relative small (e.g., 7B) LLM using the data generated following the RAG principles, so it can combine the advantages of both solutions. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that RAG-Tuned-LLM can beat long-context LLMs and RAG methods across a wide range of query types.</p></details> |  |

The recent purposed Mixed-Precision Over-the-Air Federated Learning (MP-OTA-FL) enables clients to operate at appropriate precision levels based on their heterogeneous hardware, taking advantages of the larger trade-off space while covering the quantization overheads in the mixed-precision modulation scheme for the OTA aggregation process. A key to further exploring the potential of the MP-OTA-FL framework is the optimization of client precision levels. The choice of precision level hinges on multifaceted factors including hardware capability, potential client contribution, and user satisfaction, among which factors can be difficult to define or quantify. In this paper, we propose a RAG-based User Profiling for precision planning framework that integrates retrieval-augmented LLMs and dynamic client profiling to optimize satisfaction and contributions. This includes a hybrid interface for gathering device/user insights and an RAG database storing historical quantization decisions with feedback. Experiments show that our method boosts satisfaction, energy savings, and global model accuracy in MP-OTA-FL systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, submitted to IEEE VTC 2025 fall for possible publication</p></details> |

Chatbots as question-answering systems can help in solving these challenges. LLM chatbots use NLP techniques to establish connections between topics and accurately respond to complex questions. These capabilities make it perfect for enlightenment on religion as a question-answering chatbot. However, LLMs also tend to generate false information, known as hallucination. Also, the chatbots' responses can include content that insults personal religious beliefs, interfaith conflicts, and controversial or sensitive topics. It must avoid such cases without promoting hate speech or offending certain groups of people or their beliefs. This study uses a vector database-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to enhance the accuracy and transparency of LLMs. Our question-answering system is called "MufassirQAS". We created a database consisting of several open-access books that include Turkish context. These books contain Turkish translations and interpretations of Islam. This database is utilized to answer religion-related questions and ensure our answers are trustworthy. The relevant part of the dataset, which LLM also uses, is presented along with the answer. We have put careful effort into creating system prompts that give instructions to prevent harmful, offensive, or disrespectful responses to respect people's values and provide reliable results. The system answers and shares additional information, such as the page number from the respective book and the articles referenced for obtaining the information. MufassirQAS and ChatGPT are also tested with sensitive questions. We got better performance with our system. Study and enhancements are still in progress. Results and future works are given.</p></details> |  |
| **[SOSecure: Safer Code Generation with RAG and StackOverflow Discussions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13654v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for automated code generation. Their reliance on infrequently updated pretraining data leaves them unaware of newly discovered vulnerabilities and evolving security standards, making them prone to producing insecure code. In contrast, developer communities on Stack Overflow (SO) provide an ever-evolving repository of knowledge, where security vulnerabilities are actively discussed and addressed through collective expertise. These community-driven insights remain largely untapped by LLMs. This paper introduces SOSecure, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that leverages the collective security expertise found in SO discussions to improve the security of LLM-generated code. We build a security-focused knowledge base by extracting SO answers and comments that explicitly identify vulnerabilities. Unlike common uses of RAG, SOSecure triggers after code has been generated to find discussions that identify flaws in similar code. These are used in a prompt to an LLM to consider revising the code. Evaluation across three datasets (SALLM, LLMSecEval, and LMSys) show that SOSecure achieves strong fix rates of 71.7%, 91.3%, and 96.7% respectively, compared to prompting GPT-4 without relevant discussions (49.1%, 56.5%, and 37.5%), and outperforms multiple other baselines. SOSecure operates as a language-agnostic complement to existing LLMs, without requiring retraining or fine-tuning, making it easy to deploy. Our results underscore the importance of maintaining active developer forums, which have dropped substantially in usage with LLM adoptions.</p></details> |  |

| **[Privacy-Aware RAG: Secure and Isolated Knowledge Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15548v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in real-world applications has heightened concerns about the confidentiality and integrity of their proprietary knowledge bases. These knowledge bases, which play a critical role in enhancing the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly vulnerable to breaches that could compromise sensitive information. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an advanced encryption methodology designed to protect RAG systems from unauthorized access and data leakage. Our approach encrypts both textual content and its corresponding embeddings prior to storage, ensuring that all data remains securely encrypted. This mechanism restricts access to authorized entities with the appropriate decryption keys, thereby significantly reducing the risk of unintended data exposure. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our encryption strategy preserves the performance and functionality of RAG pipelines, ensuring compatibility across diverse domains and applications. To validate the robustness of our method, we provide comprehensive security proofs that highlight its resilience against potential threats and vulnerabilities. These proofs also reveal limitations in existing approaches, which often lack robustness, adaptability, or reliance on open-source models. Our findings suggest that integrating advanced encryption techniques into the design and deployment of RAG systems can effectively enhance privacy safeguards. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on improving security measures for AI-driven services and advocates for stricter data protection standards within RAG architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAG-KG-IL: A Multi-Agent Hybrid Framework for Reducing Hallucinations and Enhancing LLM Reasoning through RAG and Incremental Knowledge Graph Learning Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13514v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents RAG-KG-IL, a novel multi-agent hybrid framework designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with an Incremental Learning (IL) approach. Despite recent advancements, LLMs still face significant challenges in reasoning with structured data, handling dynamic knowledge evolution, and mitigating hallucinations, particularly in mission-critical domains. Our proposed RAG-KG-IL framework addresses these limitations by employing a multi-agent architecture that enables continuous knowledge updates, integrates structured knowledge, and incorporates autonomous agents for enhanced explainability and reasoning. The framework utilizes RAG to ensure the generated responses are grounded in verifiable information, while KGs provide structured domain knowledge for improved consistency and depth of understanding. The Incremental Learning approach allows for dynamic updates to the knowledge base without full retraining, significantly reducing computational overhead and improving the model's adaptability. We evaluate the framework using real-world case studies involving health-related queries, comparing it to state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o and a RAG-only baseline. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces hallucination rates and improves answer completeness and reasoning accuracy. The results underscore the potential of combining RAG, KGs, and multi-agent systems to create intelligent, adaptable systems capable of real-time knowledge integration and reasoning in complex domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Relevance Isn't All You Need: Scaling RAG Systems With Inference-Time Compute Via Multi-Criteria Reranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07104v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern Large Language Model (LLM) systems typically rely on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) which aims to gather context that is useful for response generation. These RAG systems typically optimize strictly towards retrieving context that is maximally relevant to the query. However, conventional theory suggests that retrieval systems which seek to maximize context relevance without any additional explicit criteria can create information bottlenecks. We reaffirm this finding in the modern age of LLM's by showing that in standard RAG pipelines, maximizing for context relevance alone can degrade downstream response quality. In response, we show evaluations of existing RAG methods which account for both context relevance and answer quality. These evaluations introduce a novel finding that existing RAG systems scale poorly with inference time compute usage when considering our combined metric. We introduce "RErank BEyond reLevance (REBEL)", which enables RAG systems to scale with inference-time compute via injection of multi-criteria optimization using Chain-of-Thought prompting (and optionally Multi-Turn dialogue). Ultimately, this enables a new performance/speed tradeoff curve, where RAG systems are able to achieve both higher relevance of retrieved contexts and superior answer quality as inference time increases. Code for the implementation of our method in llama-index can be found at the following PR: https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/pull/17590. Code for running experiments using this llama-index implementation can be found at https://github.com/microsoft/REBEL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taxonomic Reasoning for Rare Arthropods: Combining Dense Image Captioning and RAG for Interpretable Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10886v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of pressing climate change challenges and the significant biodiversity loss among arthropods, automated taxonomic classification from organismal images is a subject of intense research. However, traditional AI pipelines based on deep neural visual architectures such as CNNs or ViTs face limitations such as degraded performance on the long-tail of classes and the inability to reason about their predictions. We integrate image captioning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) to enhance biodiversity monitoring, showing particular promise for characterizing rare and unknown arthropod species. While a naive Vision-Language Model (VLM) excels in classifying images of common species, the RAG model enables classification of rarer taxa by matching explicit textual descriptions of taxonomic features to contextual biodiversity text data from external sources. The RAG model shows promise in reducing overconfidence and enhancing accuracy relative to naive LLMs, suggesting its viability in capturing the nuances of taxonomic hierarchy, particularly at the challenging family and genus levels. Our findings highlight the potential for modern vision-language AI pipelines to support biodiversity conservation initiatives, emphasizing the role of comprehensive data curation and collaboration with citizen science platforms to improve species identification, unknown species characterization and ultimately inform conservation strategies.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |
| **[FG-RAG: Enhancing Query-Focused Summarization with Context-Aware Fine-Grained Graph RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07103v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables large language models to provide more precise and pertinent responses by incorporating external knowledge. In the Query-Focused Summarization (QFS) task, GraphRAG-based approaches have notably enhanced the comprehensiveness and diversity of generated responses. However, existing GraphRAG-based approaches predominantly focus on coarse-grained information summarization without being aware of the specific query, and the retrieved content lacks sufficient contextual information to generate comprehensive responses. To address the deficiencies of current RAG systems, we propose Context-Aware Fine-Grained Graph RAG (FG-RAG) to enhance the performance of the QFS task. FG-RAG employs Context-Aware Entity Expansion in graph retrieval to expand the coverage of retrieved entities in the graph, thus providing enough contextual information for the retrieved content. Furthermore, FG-RAG utilizes Query-Level Fine-Grained Summarization to incorporate fine-grained details during response generation, enhancing query awareness for the generated summarization. Our evaluation demonstrates that FG-RAG outperforms other RAG systems in multiple metrics of comprehensiveness, diversity, and empowerment when handling the QFS task. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/BuptWululu/FG-RAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[ClaimTrust: Propagation Trust Scoring for RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10702v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems has revolutionized large-scale content generation but has also highlighted the challenge of ensuring trustworthiness in retrieved information. This paper introduces ClaimTrust, a propagation-based trust scoring framework that dynamically evaluates the reliability of documents in a RAG system. Using a modified PageRank-inspired algorithm, ClaimTrust propagates trust scores across documents based on relationships derived from extracted factual claims. We preprocess and analyze 814 political news articles from Kaggle's Fake News Detection Dataset to extract 2,173 unique claims and classify 965 meaningful relationships (supporting or contradicting). By representing the dataset as a document graph, ClaimTrust iteratively updates trust scores until convergence, effectively differentiating trustworthy articles from unreliable ones. Our methodology, which leverages embedding-based filtering for efficient claim comparison and relationship classification, achieves a 11.2% of significant connections while maintaining computational scalability. Experimental results demonstrate that ClaimTrust successfully assigns higher trust scores to verified documents while penalizing those containing false information. Future directions include fine-tuned claim extract and compare (Li et al., 2022), parameter optimization, enhanced language model utilization, and robust evaluation metrics to generalize the framework across diverse datasets and domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
