| **[CrowdMoGen: Zero-Shot Text-Driven Collective Motion Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06188v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent advances in text-to-motion generation have shown promising results, they typically assume all individuals are grouped as a single unit. Scaling these methods to handle larger crowds and ensuring that individuals respond appropriately to specific events remains a significant challenge. This is primarily due to the complexities of scene planning, which involves organizing groups, planning their activities, and coordinating interactions, and controllable motion generation. In this paper, we present CrowdMoGen, the first zero-shot framework for collective motion generation, which effectively groups individuals and generates event-aligned motion sequences from text prompts. 1) Being limited by the available datasets for training an effective scene planning module in a supervised manner, we instead propose a crowd scene planner that leverages pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to organize individuals into distinct groups. While LLMs offer high-level guidance for group divisions, they lack the low-level understanding of human motion. To address this, we further propose integrating an SMPL-based joint prior to generate context-appropriate activities, which consists of both joint trajectories and textual descriptions. 2) Secondly, to incorporate the assigned activities into the generative network, we introduce a collective motion generator that integrates the activities into a transformer-based network in a joint-wise manner, maintaining the spatial constraints during the multi-step denoising process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CrowdMoGen significantly outperforms previous approaches, delivering realistic, event-driven motion sequences that are spatially coherent. As the first framework of collective motion generation, CrowdMoGen has the potential to advance applications in urban simulation, crowd planning, and other large-scale interactive environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://yukangcao.github.io/CrowdMoGen</p></details> |
| **[LiTransProQA: an LLM-based Literary Translation evaluation metric with Professional Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05423v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) has extended into literary domains. However, existing evaluation metrics prioritize mechanical accuracy over artistic expression and tend to overrate machine translation (MT) as being superior to experienced professional human translation. In the long run, this bias could result in a permanent decline in translation quality and cultural authenticity. In response to the urgent need for a specialized literary evaluation metric, we introduce LiTransProQA, a novel, reference-free, LLM-based question-answering framework designed specifically for literary translation evaluation. LiTransProQA uniquely integrates insights from professional literary translators and researchers, focusing on critical elements in literary quality assessment such as literary devices, cultural understanding, and authorial voice. Our extensive evaluation shows that while literary-finetuned XCOMET-XL yields marginal gains, LiTransProQA substantially outperforms current metrics, achieving up to 0.07 gain in correlation (ACC-EQ and Kendall's tau) and surpassing the best state-of-the-art metrics by over 15 points in adequacy assessments. Incorporating professional translator insights as weights further improves performance, highlighting the value of translator inputs. Notably, LiTransProQA approaches human-level evaluation performance comparable to trained linguistic annotators. It demonstrates broad applicability to open-source models such as LLaMA3.3-70b and Qwen2.5-32b, indicating its potential as an accessible and training-free literary evaluation metric and a valuable tool for evaluating texts that require local processing due to copyright or ethical considerations.</p></details> | Update WIP |
| **[The Order Effect: Investigating Prompt Sensitivity to Input Order in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04134v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) become integral to diverse applications, ensuring their reliability under varying input conditions is crucial. One key issue affecting this reliability is order sensitivity, wherein slight variations in the input arrangement can lead to inconsistent or biased outputs. Although recent advances have reduced this sensitivity, the problem remains unresolved. This paper investigates the extent of order sensitivity in LLMs whose internal components are hidden from users (such as closed-source models or those accessed via API calls). We conduct experiments across multiple tasks, including paraphrasing, relevance judgment, and multiple-choice questions. Our results show that input order significantly affects performance across tasks, with shuffled inputs leading to measurable declines in output accuracy. Few-shot prompting demonstrates mixed effectiveness and offers partial mitigation; however, fails to fully resolve the problem. These findings highlight persistent risks, particularly in high-stakes applications, and point to the need for more robust LLMs or improved input-handling techniques in future development.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first 3 authors have contributed equally</p></details> |
| **[From Millions of Tweets to Actionable Insights: Leveraging LLMs for User Profiling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06184v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social media user profiling through content analysis is crucial for tasks like misinformation detection, engagement prediction, hate speech monitoring, and user behavior modeling. However, existing profiling techniques, including tweet summarization, attribute-based profiling, and latent representation learning, face significant limitations: they often lack transferability, produce non-interpretable features, require large labeled datasets, or rely on rigid predefined categories that limit adaptability. We introduce a novel large language model (LLM)-based approach that leverages domain-defining statements, which serve as key characteristics outlining the important pillars of a domain as foundations for profiling. Our two-stage method first employs semi-supervised filtering with a domain-specific knowledge base, then generates both abstractive (synthesized descriptions) and extractive (representative tweet selections) user profiles. By harnessing LLMs' inherent knowledge with minimal human validation, our approach is adaptable across domains while reducing the need for large labeled datasets. Our method generates interpretable natural language user profiles, condensing extensive user data into a scale that unlocks LLMs' reasoning and knowledge capabilities for downstream social network tasks. We contribute a Persian political Twitter (X) dataset and an LLM-based evaluation framework with human validation. Experimental results show our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based and traditional methods by 9.8%, demonstrating its effectiveness in creating flexible, adaptable, and interpretable user profiles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MisD @ AAAI ICWSM 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Large Language Model-Enhanced Q-learning for Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06178v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW) is a classic NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem widely applied in logistics distribution and transportation management. Its complexity stems from the constraints of vehicle capacity and time windows, which pose significant challenges to traditional approaches. Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) provide new possibilities for finding approximate solutions to CVRPTW. This paper proposes a novel LLM-enhanced Q-learning framework to address the CVRPTW with real-time emergency constraints. Our solution introduces an adaptive two-phase training mechanism that transitions from the LLM-guided exploration phase to the autonomous optimization phase of Q-network. To ensure reliability, we design a three-tier self-correction mechanism based on the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for LLMs: syntactic validation, semantic verification, and physical constraint enforcement. In addition, we also prioritized replay of the experience generated by LLMs to amplify the regulatory role of LLMs in the architecture. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves a 7.3\% average reduction in cost compared to traditional Q-learning, with fewer training steps required for convergence.</p></details> |  |
| **[MonetGPT: Solving Puzzles Enhances MLLMs' Image Retouching Skills](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06176v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retouching is an essential task in post-manipulation of raw photographs. Generative editing, guided by text or strokes, provides a new tool accessible to users but can easily change the identity of the original objects in unacceptable and unpredictable ways. In contrast, although traditional procedural edits, as commonly supported by photoediting tools (e.g., Gimp, Lightroom), are conservative, they are still preferred by professionals. Unfortunately, professional quality retouching involves many individual procedural editing operations that is challenging to plan for most novices. In this paper, we ask if a multimodal large language model (MLLM) can be taught to critique raw photographs, suggest suitable remedies, and finally realize them with a given set of pre-authored procedural image operations. We demonstrate that MLLMs can be first made aware of the underlying image processing operations, by training them to solve specially designed visual puzzles. Subsequently, such an operation-aware MLLM can both plan and propose edit sequences. To facilitate training, given a set of expert-edited photos, we synthesize a reasoning dataset by procedurally manipulating the expert edits and then grounding a pretrained LLM on the visual adjustments, to synthesize reasoning for finetuning. The proposed retouching operations are, by construction, understandable by the users, preserve object details and resolution, and can be optionally overridden. We evaluate our setup on a variety of test examples and show advantages, in terms of explainability and identity preservation, over existing generative and other procedural alternatives. Code, data, models, and supplementary results can be found via our project website at https://monetgpt.github.io.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGGRAPH 2025 [ACM Transactions on Graphics]; Project website: https://monetgpt.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Turbo-ICL: In-Context Learning-Based Turbo Equalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06175v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel in-context learning (ICL) framework, inspired by large language models (LLMs), for soft-input soft-output channel equalization in coded multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The proposed approach learns to infer posterior symbol distributions directly from a prompt of pilot signals and decoder feedback. A key innovation is the use of prompt augmentation to incorporate extrinsic information from the decoder output as additional context, enabling the ICL model to refine its symbol estimates iteratively across turbo decoding iterations. Two model variants, based on Transformer and state-space architectures, are developed and evaluated. Extensive simulations demonstrate that, when traditional linear assumptions break down, e.g., in the presence of low-resolution quantization, ICL equalizers consistently outperform conventional model-based baselines, even when the latter are provided with perfect channel state information. Results also highlight the advantage of Transformer-based models under limited training diversity, as well as the efficiency of state-space models in resource-constrained scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Scaling Law for Token Efficiency in LLM Fine-Tuning Under Fixed Compute Budgets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06150v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a scaling law for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) under fixed compute budgets that explicitly accounts for data composition. Conventional approaches measure training data solely by total tokens, yet the number of examples and their average token length -- what we term \emph{dataset volume} -- play a decisive role in model performance. Our formulation is tuned following established procedures. Experiments on the BRICC dataset \cite{salavati2024reducing} and subsets of the MMLU dataset \cite{hendrycks2021measuringmassivemultitasklanguage}, evaluated under multiple subsampling strategies, reveal that data composition significantly affects token efficiency. These results motivate refined scaling laws for practical LLM fine-tuning in resource-constrained settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Prompting LLMs Unlock Hate Speech Detection across Languages? A Zero-shot and Few-shot Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06149v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite growing interest in automated hate speech detection, most existing approaches overlook the linguistic diversity of online content. Multilingual instruction-tuned large language models such as LLaMA, Aya, Qwen, and BloomZ offer promising capabilities across languages, but their effectiveness in identifying hate speech through zero-shot and few-shot prompting remains underexplored. This work evaluates LLM prompting-based detection across eight non-English languages, utilizing several prompting techniques and comparing them to fine-tuned encoder models. We show that while zero-shot and few-shot prompting lag behind fine-tuned encoder models on most of the real-world evaluation sets, they achieve better generalization on functional tests for hate speech detection. Our study also reveals that prompt design plays a critical role, with each language often requiring customized prompting techniques to maximize performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rec-R1: Bridging Generative Large Language Models and User-Centric Recommendation Systems via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24289v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Rec-R1, a general reinforcement learning framework that bridges large language models (LLMs) with recommendation systems through closed-loop optimization. Unlike prompting and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), Rec-R1 directly optimizes LLM generation using feedback from a fixed black-box recommendation model, without relying on synthetic SFT data from proprietary models such as GPT-4o. This avoids the substantial cost and effort required for data distillation. To verify the effectiveness of Rec-R1, we evaluate it on two representative tasks: product search and sequential recommendation. Experimental results demonstrate that Rec-R1 not only consistently outperforms prompting- and SFT-based methods, but also achieves significant gains over strong discriminative baselines, even when used with simple retrievers such as BM25. Moreover, Rec-R1 preserves the general-purpose capabilities of the LLM, unlike SFT, which often impairs instruction-following and reasoning. These findings suggest Rec-R1 as a promising foundation for continual task-specific adaptation without catastrophic forgetting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can open source large language models be used for tumor documentation in Germany? -- An evaluation on urological doctors' notes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12106v3)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tumor documentation in Germany is largely done manually, requiring reading patient records and entering data into structured databases. Large language models (LLMs) could potentially enhance this process by improving efficiency and reliability. This evaluation tests eleven different open source LLMs with sizes ranging from 1-70 billion model parameters on three basic tasks of the tumor documentation process: identifying tumor diagnoses, assigning ICD-10 codes, and extracting the date of first diagnosis. For evaluating the LLMs on these tasks, a dataset of annotated text snippets based on anonymized doctors' notes from urology was prepared. Different prompting strategies were used to investigate the effect of the number of examples in few-shot prompting and to explore the capabilities of the LLMs in general. The models Llama 3.1 8B, Mistral 7B, and Mistral NeMo 12 B performed comparably well in the tasks. Models with less extensive training data or having fewer than 7 billion parameters showed notably lower performance, while larger models did not display performance gains. Examples from a different medical domain than urology could also improve the outcome in few-shot prompting, which demonstrates the ability of LLMs to handle tasks needed for tumor documentation. Open source LLMs show a strong potential for automating tumor documentation. Models from 7-12 billion parameters could offer an optimal balance between performance and resource efficiency. With tailored fine-tuning and well-designed prompting, these models might become important tools for clinical documentation in the future. The code for the evaluation is available from https://github.com/stefan-m-lenz/UroLlmEval. We also release the dataset as a new valuable resource that addresses the shortage of authentic and easily accessible benchmarks in German-language medical NLP.</p></details> | 53 pages, 5 figures |
| **["Set It Up!": Functional Object Arrangement with Compositional Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11928v3)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the challenge of developing robots capable of understanding under-specified instructions for creating functional object arrangements, such as "set up a dining table for two"; previous arrangement approaches have focused on much more explicit instructions, such as "put object A on the table." We introduce a framework, SetItUp, for learning to interpret under-specified instructions. SetItUp takes a small number of training examples and a human-crafted program sketch to uncover arrangement rules for specific scene types. By leveraging an intermediate graph-like representation of abstract spatial relationships among objects, SetItUp decomposes the arrangement problem into two subproblems: i) learning the arrangement patterns from limited data and ii) grounding these abstract relationships into object poses. SetItUp leverages large language models (LLMs) to propose the abstract spatial relationships among objects in novel scenes as the constraints to be satisfied; then, it composes a library of diffusion models associated with these abstract relationships to find object poses that satisfy the constraints. We validate our framework on a dataset comprising study desks, dining tables, and coffee tables, with the results showing superior performance in generating physically plausible, functional, and aesthetically pleasing object arrangements compared to existing models.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages main paper, 21 pages appendix, RSS 2024</p></details> |
| **[The Typing Cure: Experiences with Large Language Model Chatbots for Mental Health Support](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14362v3)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>People experiencing severe distress increasingly use Large Language Model (LLM) chatbots as mental health support tools. Discussions on social media have described how engagements were lifesaving for some, but evidence suggests that general-purpose LLM chatbots also have notable risks that could endanger the welfare of users if not designed responsibly. In this study, we investigate the lived experiences of people who have used LLM chatbots for mental health support. We build on interviews with 21 individuals from globally diverse backgrounds to analyze how users create unique support roles for their chatbots, fill in gaps in everyday care, and navigate associated cultural limitations when seeking support from chatbots. We ground our analysis in psychotherapy literature around effective support, and introduce the concept of therapeutic alignment, or aligning AI with therapeutic values for mental health contexts. Our study offers recommendations for how designers can approach the ethical and effective use of LLM chatbots and other AI mental health support tools in mental health care.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally to this work; typos corrected and post-review revisions incorporated</p></details> |
| **[LLMs Get Lost In Multi-Turn Conversation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06120v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are conversational interfaces. As such, LLMs have the potential to assist their users not only when they can fully specify the task at hand, but also to help them define, explore, and refine what they need through multi-turn conversational exchange. Although analysis of LLM conversation logs has confirmed that underspecification occurs frequently in user instructions, LLM evaluation has predominantly focused on the single-turn, fully-specified instruction setting. In this work, we perform large-scale simulation experiments to compare LLM performance in single- and multi-turn settings. Our experiments confirm that all the top open- and closed-weight LLMs we test exhibit significantly lower performance in multi-turn conversations than single-turn, with an average drop of 39% across six generation tasks. Analysis of 200,000+ simulated conversations decomposes the performance degradation into two components: a minor loss in aptitude and a significant increase in unreliability. We find that LLMs often make assumptions in early turns and prematurely attempt to generate final solutions, on which they overly rely. In simpler terms, we discover that *when LLMs take a wrong turn in a conversation, they get lost and do not recover*.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models Are Struggle to Cope with Unreasonability in Math Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19346v5)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research have demonstrated LLMs' impressive performance in math and reasoning. However, the capacity of LLMs to address math problems under unconventional conditions, such as internal inconsistencies and flawed assumptions, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel benchmark Unreasonable Math Problem (UMP) designed to assess LLMs' ability to recognize and respond to unreasonability in math problem. The benchmark consists of a carefully curated collection of unreasonable math questions across diverse types. Based on extensive experiments covering 19 LLMs, we observe that even state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o achieve only limited performance of 0.6 in UMP, while reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 are prone to overthinking and unstable. We further explore strategies for improving the recognition of unreasonable inputs, shedding light on both the possibility and limitations of LLMs in this challenging setting.</p></details> | 32 pages, 8 figures |
| **[LLMs Outperform Experts on Challenging Biology Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06108v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study systematically evaluates 27 frontier Large Language Models on eight diverse biology benchmarks spanning molecular biology, genetics, cloning, virology, and biosecurity. Models from major AI developers released between November 2022 and April 2025 were assessed through ten independent runs per benchmark. The findings reveal dramatic improvements in biological capabilities. Top model performance increased more than 4-fold on the challenging text-only subset of the Virology Capabilities Test over the study period, with the top model now performing twice as well as expert virologists. Several models now match or exceed expert-level performance on other challenging benchmarks, including LAB-Bench CloningScenarios and the biology subsets of GPQA and WMDP. Contrary to expectations, chain-of-thought did not substantially improve performance over zero-shot evaluation, while extended reasoning features in o3-mini and Claude 3.7 Sonnet typically improved performance as predicted by inference scaling. Benchmarks such as PubMedQA and the MMLU and WMDP biology subsets exhibited performance plateaus well below 100%, suggesting benchmark saturation and errors in the underlying benchmark data. The analysis highlights the need for more sophisticated evaluation methodologies as AI systems continue to advance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Free and Fair Hardware: A Pathway to Copyright Infringement-Free Verilog Generation using LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06096v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Limitations in Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities for hardware design tasks, such as generating functional Verilog codes, have motivated various fine-tuning optimizations utilizing curated hardware datasets from open-source repositories. However, these datasets remain limited in size and contain minimal checks on licensing for reuse, resulting in potential copyright violations by fine-tuned LLMs. Therefore, we propose an evaluation benchmark to estimate the risk of Verilog-trained LLMs to generate copyright-protected codes. To minimize this risk, we present an open-source Verilog dataset, FreeSet, containing over 220k files, along with the automated dataset curation framework utilized to provide additional guarantees of fair-use Verilog data. We then execute an LLM fine-tuning framework consisting of continual pre-training, resulting in a fine-tuned Llama model for Verilog, FreeV. Our results indicate that FreeV demonstrates the smallest risk of copyright-infringement among prior works, with only a 3% violation rate. Furthermore, experimental results demonstrate improvements in Verilog generation functionality over its baseline model, improving VerilogEval pass@10 rates by over 10%.</p></details> | Accepted at DAC 2025 |

This paper evaluates the performance of the Tenstorrent Grayskull e75 RISC-V accelerator for basic linear algebra kernels at reduced numerical precision, a fundamental operation in LLM computations. We present a detailed characterization of Grayskull's execution model, gridsize, matrix dimensions, data formats, and numerical precision impact computational efficiency. Furthermore, we compare Grayskull's performance against state-of-the-art architectures with tensor acceleration, including Intel Sapphire Rapids processors and two NVIDIA GPUs (V100 and A100). Whilst NVIDIA GPUs dominate raw performance, Grayskull demonstrates a competitive trade-off between power consumption and computational throughput, reaching a peak of 1.55 TFLOPs/Watt with BF16.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the Computational Aspects of Deep Learning Workshop at ISC High Performance 2025.

| **[An Invitation to Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08365v3)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training a deep neural network to maximize a target objective has become the standard recipe for successful machine learning over the last decade. These networks can be optimized with supervised learning, if the target objective is differentiable. For many interesting problems, this is however not the case. Common objectives like intersection over union (IoU), bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) score or rewards cannot be optimized with supervised learning. A common workaround is to define differentiable surrogate losses, leading to suboptimal solutions with respect to the actual objective. Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising alternative for optimizing deep neural networks to maximize non-differentiable objectives in recent years. Examples include aligning large language models via human feedback, code generation, object detection or control problems. This makes RL techniques relevant to the larger machine learning audience. The subject is, however, time intensive to approach due to the large range of methods, as well as the often very theoretical presentation. In this introduction, we take an alternative approach, different from classic reinforcement learning textbooks. Rather than focusing on tabular problems, we introduce reinforcement learning as a generalization of supervised learning, which we first apply to non-differentiable objectives and later to temporal problems. Assuming only basic knowledge of supervised learning, the reader will be able to understand state-of-the-art deep RL algorithms like proximal policy optimization (PPO) after reading this tutorial.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at Foundations and Trends in Optimization</p></details> |

To bridge the gap, we introduce Sentient Agent as a Judge (SAGE), an automated evaluation framework that measures an LLM's higher-order social cognition. SAGE instantiates a Sentient Agent that simulates human-like emotional changes and inner thoughts during interaction, providing a more realistic evaluation of the tested model in multi-turn conversations. At every turn, the agent reasons about (i) how its emotion changes, (ii) how it feels, and (iii) how it should reply, yielding a numerical emotion trajectory and interpretable inner thoughts. Experiments on 100 supportive-dialogue scenarios show that the final Sentient emotion score correlates strongly with Barrett-Lennard Relationship Inventory (BLRI) ratings and utterance-level empathy metrics, validating psychological fidelity. We also build a public Sentient Leaderboard covering 18 commercial and open-source models that uncovers substantial gaps (up to 4x) between frontier systems (GPT-4o-Latest, Gemini2.5-Pro) and earlier baselines, gaps not reflected in conventional leaderboards (e.g., Arena). SAGE thus provides a principled, scalable and interpretable tool for tracking progress toward genuinely empathetic and socially adept language agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code: https://github.com/Tencent/digitalhuman/tree/main/SAGE</p></details> |

Benchmarking LLM Knowledge of UK Government Public Health Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06046v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) become widely accessible, a detailed understanding of their knowledge within specific domains becomes necessary for successful real world use. This is particularly critical in public health, where failure to retrieve relevant, accurate, and current information could significantly impact UK residents. However, currently little is known about LLM knowledge of UK Government public health information. To address this issue, this paper introduces a new benchmark, PubHealthBench, with over 8000 questions for evaluating LLMs' Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA) and free form responses to public health queries, created via an automated pipeline. We also release a new dataset of the extracted UK Government public health guidance documents used as source text for PubHealthBench. Assessing 24 LLMs on PubHealthBench we find the latest private LLMs (GPT-4.5, GPT-4.1 and o1) have a high degree of knowledge, achieving >90% in the MCQA setup, and outperform humans with cursory search engine use. However, in the free form setup we see lower performance with no model scoring >75%. Therefore, whilst there are promising signs that state of the art (SOTA) LLMs are an increasingly accurate source of public health information, additional safeguards or tools may still be needed when providing free form responses on public health topics.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 10 pages main text</p></details> |

While recent advancements have primarily focused on improving the model structure and training data of MRMs, there has been limited exploration into the effectiveness of long-term reasoning capabilities for reward modeling and how to activate these capabilities in MRMs. In this paper, we explore how Reinforcement Learning (RL) can be used to improve reward modeling. Specifically, we reformulate the reward modeling problem as a rule-based RL task. However, we observe that directly applying existing RL algorithms, such as Reinforce++, to reward modeling often leads to training instability or even collapse due to the inherent limitations of these algorithms. To address this issue, we propose the StableReinforce algorithm, which refines the training loss, advantage estimation strategy, and reward design of existing RL methods. These refinements result in more stable training dynamics and superior performance. To facilitate MRM training, we collect 200K preference data from diverse datasets. Our reward model, R1-Reward, trained using the StableReinforce algorithm on this dataset, significantly improves performance on multimodal reward modeling benchmarks. Compared to previous SOTA models, R1-Reward achieves a $8.4\%$ improvement on the VL Reward-Bench and a $14.3\%$ improvement on the Multimodal Reward Bench. Moreover, with more inference compute, R1-Reward's performance is further enhanced, highlighting the potential of RL algorithms in optimizing MRMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Home ...</summary><p>Home page: https://github.com/yfzhang114/r1_reward</p></details> |

Unilogit addresses the challenge of selectively forgetting specific information while maintaining overall model utility, a critical task in compliance with data privacy regulations like GDPR. Unlike prior methods that rely on static hyperparameters or starting model outputs, Unilogit dynamically adjusts target logits to achieve a uniform probability for the target token, leveraging the current model's outputs for more accurate self-distillation targets. This approach not only eliminates the need for additional hyperparameters but also enhances the model's ability to approximate the golden targets.

| **[ArtRAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Structured Context for Visual Art Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06020v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding visual art requires reasoning across multiple perspectives -- cultural, historical, and stylistic -- beyond mere object recognition. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) perform well on general image captioning, they often fail to capture the nuanced interpretations that fine art demands. We propose ArtRAG, a novel, training-free framework that combines structured knowledge with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for multi-perspective artwork explanation. ArtRAG automatically constructs an Art Context Knowledge Graph (ACKG) from domain-specific textual sources, organizing entities such as artists, movements, themes, and historical events into a rich, interpretable graph. At inference time, a multi-granular structured retriever selects semantically and topologically relevant subgraphs to guide generation. This enables MLLMs to produce contextually grounded, culturally informed art descriptions. Experiments on the SemArt and Artpedia datasets show that ArtRAG outperforms several heavily trained baselines. Human evaluations further confirm that ArtRAG generates coherent, insightful, and culturally enriched interpretations.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods generally suffer from several problems: 1) Direct fine-tuning often undermines the generalization capability of the pre-trained model; 2) The exploration of task-specific information is insufficient in the visual tasks; 3) The semantic order information is typically overlooked during text modeling; 4) Existing cross-modal alignment techniques ignore the temporal coupling of multimodal information. To address these, we propose Task-Adapter++, a parameter-efficient dual adaptation method for both image and text encoders. Specifically, to make full use of the variations across different few-shot learning tasks, we design a task-specific adaptation for the image encoder so that the most discriminative information can be well noticed during feature extraction. Furthermore, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate detailed sequential sub-action descriptions for each action class, and introduce semantic order adapters into the text encoder to effectively model the sequential relationships between these sub-actions. Finally, we develop an innovative fine-grained cross-modal alignment strategy that actively maps visual features to reside in the same temporal stage as semantic descriptions. Extensive experiments fully demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on 5 benchmarks consistently. The code is open-sourced at https://github.com/Jaulin-Bage/Task-Adapter-pp.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2408.00249</p></details> |
| **[AGITB: A Signal-Level Benchmark for Evaluating Artificial General Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04430v3)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite remarkable progress in machine learning, current AI systems continue to fall short of true human-like intelligence. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in pattern recognition and response generation, they lack genuine understanding - an essential hallmark of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Existing AGI evaluation methods fail to offer a practical, gradual, and informative metric. This paper introduces the Artificial General Intelligence Test Bed (AGITB), comprising twelve rigorous tests that form a signal-processing-level foundation for the potential emergence of cognitive capabilities. AGITB evaluates intelligence through a model's ability to predict binary signals across time without relying on symbolic representations or pretraining. Unlike high-level tests grounded in language or perception, AGITB focuses on core computational invariants reflective of biological intelligence, such as determinism, sensitivity, and generalisation. The test bed assumes no prior bias, operates independently of semantic meaning, and ensures unsolvability through brute force or memorization. While humans pass AGITB by design, no current AI system has met its criteria, making AGITB a compelling benchmark for guiding and recognizing progress toward AGI.</p></details> | 13 pages |

This is certainly the case for the upcoming High-Luminosity LHC upgrade. Such increased data processing requirements forces revisions to almost every step of the data processing pipeline. One such step in need of an overhaul is the task of particle track reconstruction, a.k.a., tracking. A Machine Learning-assisted solution is expected to provide significant improvements, since the most time-consuming step in tracking is the assignment of hits to particles or track candidates. This is the topic of this paper. We take inspiration from large language models. As such, we consider two approaches: the prediction of the next word in a sentence (next hit point in a track), as well as the one-shot prediction of all hits within an event. In an extensive design effort, we have experimented with three models based on the Transformer architecture and one model based on the U-Net architecture, performing track association predictions for collision event hit points. In our evaluation, we consider a spectrum of simple to complex representations of the problem, eliminating designs with lower metrics early on. We report extensive results, covering both prediction accuracy (score) and computational performance. We have made use of the REDVID simulation framework, as well as reductions applied to the TrackML data set, to compose five data sets from simple to complex, for our experiments. The results highlight distinct advantages among different designs in terms of prediction accuracy and computational performance, demonstrating the efficiency of our methodology. Most importantly, the results show the viability of a one-shot encoder-classifier based Transformer solution as a practical approach for the task of tracking.</p></details> |  |
| **[NeoQA: Evidence-based Question Answering with Generated News Events](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05949v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in large language models (LLMs) is challenging because benchmarks can quickly become stale. Questions initially requiring retrieval may become answerable from pretraining knowledge as newer models incorporate more recent information during pretraining, making it difficult to distinguish evidence-based reasoning from recall. We introduce NeoQA (News Events for Out-of-training Question Answering), a benchmark designed to address this issue. To construct NeoQA, we generated timelines and knowledge bases of fictional news events and entities along with news articles and Q\&A pairs to prevent LLMs from leveraging pretraining knowledge, ensuring that no prior evidence exists in their training data. We propose our dataset as a new platform for evaluating evidence-based question answering, as it requires LLMs to generate responses exclusively from retrieved evidence and only when sufficient evidence is available. NeoQA enables controlled evaluation across various evidence scenarios, including cases with missing or misleading details. Our findings indicate that LLMs struggle to distinguish subtle mismatches between questions and evidence, and suffer from short-cut reasoning when key information required to answer a question is missing from the evidence, underscoring key limitations in evidence-based reasoning.</p></details> |  |

We automatically create summaries (guiding principles) of German judgments by fine-tuning a decoder-based large language model. We enrich the judgments with information about legal entities before the training. For the evaluation of the created summaries, we define a set of evaluation classes which allows us to measure their language, pertinence, completeness and correctness. Our results show that employing legal entities helps the generative model to find the relevant content, but the quality of the created summaries is not yet sufficient for a use in practice.</p></details> |  |

We apply elastic weight consolidation (EWC) to the full set of the model's parameters and investigate language understanding benchmarks, consisting of Arc, Belebele, Gsm8K, Hellaswag, MMLU, TruthfulQA, and Winogrande sets (both in English and Lithuanian versions), and perplexity benchmarks. We empirically demonstrate that EWC regularisation allows us not only to mitigate catastrophic forgetting effects but also that it is potentially beneficial for learning of the new task with LLMs.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

However, despite their widespread deployment in inference services such as ChatGPT, concerns about the potential leakage of sensitive user data have arisen. Existing solutions primarily rely on privacy-enhancing technologies to mitigate such risks, facing the trade-off among efficiency, privacy, and utility. To narrow this gap, we propose Cape, a context-aware prompt perturbation mechanism based on differential privacy, to enable efficient inference with an improved privacy-utility trade-off. Concretely, we introduce a hybrid utility function that better captures the token similarity. Additionally, we propose a bucketized sampling mechanism to handle large sampling space, which might lead to long-tail phenomenons. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets, along with ablation studies, demonstrate that Cape achieves a better privacy-utility trade-off compared to prior state-of-the-art works.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in ICML 2025</p></details> |

Existing evaluation methods often rely either on real-world long texts, making it difficult to exclude the influence of models' inherent knowledge, or introduce irrelevant filler content to artificially achieve target lengths, reducing assessment effectiveness. To address these limitations, we introduce NeedleBench, a synthetic framework for assessing retrieval and reasoning performance in bilingual long-context tasks with adaptive context lengths. NeedleBench systematically embeds key data points at varying depths to rigorously test model capabilities. Tasks are categorized into two scenarios: information-sparse, featuring minimal relevant details within extensive irrelevant text to simulate simple retrieval tasks; and information-dense (the Ancestral Trace Challenge), where relevant information is continuously distributed throughout the context to simulate complex reasoning tasks. Our experiments reveal that although recent reasoning models like Deepseek-R1 and OpenAI's o3 excel in mathematical reasoning, they struggle with continuous retrieval and reasoning in information-dense scenarios, even at shorter context lengths. We also characterize a phenomenon termed 'under-thinking', where models prematurely conclude reasoning despite available information. NeedleBench thus provides critical insights and targeted tools essential for evaluating and improving LLMs' long-context capabilities.

However, it is challenged by the inefficiency and bias of hypothesis generation, barriers to multimodal data complexity, and the methodological fragility of causal experimentation. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) present an opportunity to rethink how urban causal analysis is conducted. This Perspective examines current urban causal research by analyzing taxonomies that categorize research topics, data sources, and methodological approaches to identify structural gaps. We then introduce an LLM-driven conceptual framework, AutoUrbanCI, composed of four distinct modular agents responsible for hypothesis generation, data engineering, experiment design and execution, and results interpretation with policy recommendations. We propose evaluation criteria for rigor and transparency and reflect on implications for human-AI collaboration, equity, and accountability. We call for a new research agenda that embraces AI-augmented workflows not as replacements for human expertise but as tools to broaden participation, improve reproducibility, and unlock more inclusive forms of urban causal reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolutionary ecology of words](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05863v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a model for the evolutionary ecology of words as one attempt to extend evolutionary game theory and agent-based models by utilizing the rich linguistic expressions of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our model enables the emergence and evolution of diverse and infinite options for interactions among agents. Within the population, each agent possesses a short word (or phrase) generated by an LLM and moves within a spatial environment. When agents become adjacent, the outcome of their interaction is determined by the LLM based on the relationship between their words, with the loser's word being replaced by the winner's. Word mutations, also based on LLM outputs, may occur. We conducted preliminary experiments assuming that ``strong animal species" would survive. The results showed that from an initial population consisting of well-known species, many species emerged both gradually and in a punctuated equilibrium manner. Each trial demonstrated the unique evolution of diverse populations, with one type of large species becoming dominant, such as terrestrial animals, marine life, or extinct species, which were ecologically specialized and adapted ones across diverse extreme habitats. We also conducted a long-term experiment with a large population, demonstrating the emergence and coexistence of diverse species.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

While fine-tuned (M)SLMs enable edge deployment, they often lose general capabilities and struggle with complex tasks. To address this, we propose \textbf{EcoAgent}, an \textbf{E}dge-\textbf{C}loud c\textbf{O}llaborative multi-agent framework for mobile automation. EcoAgent features a closed-loop collaboration among a cloud-based Planning Agent and two edge-based agents: the Execution Agent for action execution and the Observation Agent for verifying outcomes. The Observation Agent uses a Pre-Understanding Module to compress screen images into concise text, reducing token usage and communication overhead. In case of failure, the Planning Agent retrieves screen history through a Memory Module and replans via a Reflection Module. Experiments on AndroidWorld show that EcoAgent achieves task success rates comparable to cloud-based mobile agents while significantly reducing MLLM token consumption, enabling efficient and practical mobile automation.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgentXploit: End-to-End Redteaming of Black-Box AI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05849v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The strong planning and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have fostered the development of agent-based systems capable of leveraging external tools and interacting with increasingly complex environments. However, these powerful features also introduce a critical security risk: indirect prompt injection, a sophisticated attack vector that compromises the core of these agents, the LLM, by manipulating contextual information rather than direct user prompts. In this work, we propose a generic black-box fuzzing framework, AgentXploit, designed to automatically discover and exploit indirect prompt injection vulnerabilities across diverse LLM agents. Our approach starts by constructing a high-quality initial seed corpus, then employs a seed selection algorithm based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to iteratively refine inputs, thereby maximizing the likelihood of uncovering agent weaknesses. We evaluate AgentXploit on two public benchmarks, AgentDojo and VWA-adv, where it achieves 71% and 70% success rates against agents based on o3-mini and GPT-4o, respectively, nearly doubling the performance of baseline attacks. Moreover, AgentXploit exhibits strong transferability across unseen tasks and internal LLMs, as well as promising results against defenses. Beyond benchmark evaluations, we apply our attacks in real-world environments, successfully misleading agents to navigate to arbitrary URLs, including malicious sites.</p></details> |  |

These challenges may stem from insufficient reasoning and problem decomposition capabilities. To address this issue, we propose a reasoning-augmented data generation process, SRA-MCTS, which guides the model to autonomously generate high-quality intermediate reasoning paths. This creates a positive feedback loop, enabling continuous improvement. Our method operates entirely through the model itself without requiring additional supervision. By synthesizing natural language reasoning paths and translating them into executable code, the approach ensures analytical accuracy and enhances the success rate in solving complex tasks. Experimental results show that, even without additional supervisory signals, our method achieves performance improvements across different model scales, demonstrating the significant potential of self-improvement in small models. Furthermore, the method remains robust when traditional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approaches exhibit performance degradation, with notable improvements observed in diversity metrics such as pass@10. We encourage further exploration of reasoning processes within training data to enhance the ability of language models to address complex problems.

However, existing AI-based regulation techniques are often tailored to specific application domains and thus are difficult to generalize in an automated manner. This paper presents Horae, a unified specification language for modeling (multimodal) regulation rules across a diverse set of domains. We showcase how Horae facilitates an intelligent service regulation pipeline by further exploiting a fine-tuned large language model named RuleGPT that automates the Horae modeling process, thereby yielding an end-to-end framework for fully automated intelligent service regulation. The feasibility and effectiveness of our framework are demonstrated over a benchmark of various real-world regulation domains. In particular, we show that our open-sourced, fine-tuned RuleGPT with 7B parameters suffices to outperform GPT-3.5 and perform on par with GPT-4o.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full version of IJCAI 2025</p></details> |

Although robotic arms are currently used primarily for functional tasks, there is considerable potential to explore ways to enhance users' body language capabilities during social interactions. This paper introduces an Augmented Body Communicator system that integrates robotic arms and a large language model. Through the incorporation of kinetic memory, disabled users and their supporters can collaboratively design actions for the robot arm. The LLM system then provides suggestions on the most suitable action based on contextual cues during interactions. The system underwent thorough user testing with six participants who have conditions affecting upper limb mobility. Results indicate that the system improves users' ability to express themselves. Based on our findings, we offer recommendations for developing robotic arms that support disabled individuals with body language capabilities and functional tasks.</p></details> |  |

In AnaQuest, the choice items are sentence-level assertions about complex concepts. The technique integrates formative and summative assessments. In the formative phase, students answer open-ended questions for target concepts in free text. For summative assessment, AnaQuest analyzes these responses to generate both correct and incorrect assertions. To evaluate the validity of the generated MCQs, Item Response Theory (IRT) was applied to compare item characteristics between MCQs generated by AnaQuest, a baseline ChatGPT prompt, and human-crafted items. An empirical study found that expert instructors rated MCQs generated by both AI models to be as valid as those created by human instructors. However, IRT-based analysis revealed that AnaQuest-generated questions - particularly those with incorrect assertions (foils) - more closely resembled human-crafted items in terms of difficulty and discrimination than those produced by ChatGPT.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a pre-print version of a paper to appear in AIED2025</p></details> |

While these models show strong reasoning abilities, their performance varies significantly across languages due to imbalanced training data distribution. Existing approaches using sample-level translation for extensive multilingual pretraining and cross-lingual tuning face scalability challenges and often fail to capture nuanced reasoning processes across languages. In this paper, we introduce AdaCoT (Adaptive Chain-of-Thought), a framework that enhances multilingual factual reasoning by dynamically routing thought processes in intermediary ``thinking languages'' before generating target-language responses. AdaCoT leverages a language-agnostic core and incorporates an adaptive, reward-based mechanism for selecting optimal reasoning pathways without requiring additional pretraining. Our comprehensive evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates substantial improvements in both factual reasoning quality and cross-lingual consistency, with particularly strong performance gains in low-resource language settings. The results suggest that adaptive reasoning paths can effectively bridge the performance gap between high and low-resource languages while maintaining cultural and linguistic nuances.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimating LLM Uncertainty with Evidence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00290v5)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past few years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have developed rapidly and are widely applied in various domains. However, LLMs face the issue of hallucinations, generating responses that may be unreliable when the models lack relevant knowledge. To be aware of potential hallucinations, uncertainty estimation methods have been introduced, and most of them have confirmed that reliability lies in critical tokens. However, probability-based methods perform poorly in identifying token reliability, limiting their practical utility. In this paper, we reveal that the probability-based method fails to estimate token reliability due to the loss of evidence strength information which is accumulated in the training stage. Therefore, we present Logits-induced token uncertainty (LogTokU), a framework for estimating decoupled token uncertainty in LLMs, enabling real-time uncertainty estimation without requiring multiple sampling processes. We employ evidence modeling to implement LogTokU and use the estimated uncertainty to guide downstream tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that LogTokU has significant effectiveness and promise.</p></details> |  |

However, existing deductive reasoning benchmarks, which are crucial for evaluating and advancing LLMs, are inadequate due to their lack of task complexity, presence of prior knowledge as a confounder, and superficial error analysis. To address these deficiencies, we introduce JustLogic, a synthetically generated deductive reasoning benchmark designed for rigorous evaluation of LLMs. JustLogic is (i) highly complex, capable of generating a diverse range of linguistic patterns, vocabulary, and argument structures; (ii) prior knowledge independent, eliminating the advantage of models possessing prior knowledge and ensuring that only deductive reasoning is used to answer questions; and (iii) capable of in-depth error analysis on the heterogeneous effects of reasoning depth and argument form on model accuracy. Our experimental results on JustLogic reveal that (i) state-of-the-art (SOTA) reasoning LLMs perform on par or better than the human average but significantly worse than the human ceiling, and (ii) SOTA non-reasoning models still underperform the human average.

Next-Generation AI Computing Hardware Using Photonic Chips](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05794v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly pushing the limits of contemporary computing hardware. For example, training GPT-3 has been estimated to consume around 1300 MWh of electricity, and projections suggest future models may require city-scale (gigawatt) power budgets. These demands motivate exploration of computing paradigms beyond conventional von Neumann architectures. This review surveys emerging photonic hardware optimized for next-generation generative AI computing. We discuss integrated photonic neural network architectures (e.g., Mach-Zehnder interferometer meshes, lasers, wavelength-multiplexed microring resonators) that perform ultrafast matrix operations. We also examine promising alternative neuromorphic devices, including spiking neural network circuits and hybrid spintronic-photonic synapses, which combine memory and processing. The integration of two-dimensional materials (graphene, TMDCs) into silicon photonic platforms is reviewed for tunable modulators and on-chip synaptic elements. Transformer-based LLM architectures (self-attention and feed-forward layers) are analyzed in this context, identifying strategies and challenges for mapping dynamic matrix multiplications onto these novel hardware substrates. We then dissect the mechanisms of mainstream LLMs, such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and LLaMA, highlighting their architectural similarities and differences. We synthesize state-of-the-art components, algorithms, and integration methods, highlighting key advances and open issues in scaling such systems to mega-sized LLM models. We find that photonic computing systems could potentially surpass electronic processors by orders of magnitude in throughput and energy efficiency, but require breakthroughs in memory, especially for long-context windows and long token sequences, and in storage of ultra-large datasets.</p></details> | 36 pages, 22 figures |

In this study, we propose a novel Interactive Fiction (IF) framework powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to encourage perspective-taking and reduce biases against these stigmatized yet essential roles. Through an experiment with participants (n = 100) across four such occupations, we observed a significant increase in participants' understanding of these occupations, as well as a high level of empathy and a strong sense of connection to individuals in these roles. Additionally, qualitative interviews with participants (n = 15) revealed that the LLM-based perspective-taking IF enhanced immersion, deepened emotional resonance and empathy toward "dirty work," and allowed participants to experience a sense of professional fulfillment in these occupations. However, participants also highlighted ongoing challenges, such as limited contextual details generated by the LLM and the unintentional reinforcement of existing stereotypes. Overall, our findings underscore that an LLM-based perspective-taking IF framework offers a promising and scalable strategy for mitigating stigma and promoting social equity in marginalized professions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference paper for FAccT '25</p></details> |

This creates a bottleneck in memory bandwidth, especially as context lengths increase. Processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures are a promising solution, offering high internal bandwidth and compute parallelism near memory. However, current PIM designs are primarily optimized for dense attention and struggle with the dynamic, irregular access patterns introduced by modern KV cache sparsity techniques. Consequently, they suffer from workload imbalance, reducing throughput and resource utilization. In this work, we propose STARC, a novel sparsity-optimized data mapping scheme tailored specifically for efficient LLM decoding on PIM architectures. STARC clusters KV pairs by semantic similarity and maps them to contiguous memory regions aligned with PIM bank structures. During decoding, queries retrieve relevant tokens at cluster granularity by matching against precomputed centroids, enabling selective attention and parallel processing without frequent reclustering or data movement overhead. Experiments on the HBM-PIM system show that, compared to common token-wise sparsity methods, STARC reduces attention-layer latency by 19%--31% and energy consumption by 19%--27%. Under a KV cache budget of 1024, it achieves up to 54%--74% latency reduction and 45%--67% energy reduction compared to full KV cache retrieval. Meanwhile, STARC maintains model accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art sparse attention methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling efficient and hardware-friendly long-context LLM inference on PIM architectures.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of existing benchmarks for CodeLLMs and agents, studying and analyzing 181 benchmarks from 461 relevant papers, covering the different phases of the software development life cycle (SDLC). Our findings reveal a notable imbalance in the coverage of current benchmarks, with approximately 60% focused on the software development phase in SDLC, while requirements engineering and software design phases receive minimal attention at only 5% and 3%, respectively. Additionally, Python emerges as the dominant programming language across the reviewed benchmarks. Finally, this paper highlights the challenges of current research and proposes future directions, aiming to narrow the gap between the theoretical capabilities of CodeLLMs and agents and their application in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[APOLLO: Automated LLM and Lean Collaboration for Advanced Formal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05758v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Formal reasoning and automated theorem proving constitute a challenging subfield of machine learning, in which machines are tasked with proving mathematical theorems using formal languages like Lean. A formal verification system can check whether a formal proof is correct or not almost instantaneously, but generating a completely correct formal proof with large language models (LLMs) remains a formidable task. The usual approach in the literature is to prompt the LLM many times (up to several thousands) until one of the generated proofs passes the verification system. In this work, we present APOLLO (Automated PrOof repair via LLM and Lean cOllaboration), a modular, model-agnostic pipeline that combines the strengths of the Lean compiler with an LLM's reasoning abilities to achieve better proof-generation results at a low sampling budget. Apollo directs a fully automated process in which the LLM generates proofs for theorems, a set of agents analyze the proofs, fix the syntax errors, identify the mistakes in the proofs using Lean, isolate failing sub-lemmas, utilize automated solvers, and invoke an LLM on each remaining goal with a low top-K budget. The repaired sub-proofs are recombined and reverified, iterating up to a user-controlled maximum number of attempts. On the miniF2F benchmark, we establish a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 75.0% among 7B-parameter models while keeping the sampling budget below one thousand. Moreover, Apollo raises the state-of-the-art accuracy for Goedel-Prover-SFT to 65.6% while cutting sample complexity from 25,600 to a few hundred. General-purpose models (o3-mini, o4-mini) jump from 3-7% to over 40% accuracy. Our results demonstrate that targeted, compiler-guided repair of LLM outputs yields dramatic gains in both efficiency and correctness, suggesting a general paradigm for scalable automated theorem proving.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolutionary thoughts: integration of large language models and evolutionary algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05756v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have unveiled remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating both natural language and code, but LLM reasoning is prone to hallucination and struggle with complex, novel scenarios, often getting stuck on partial or incorrect solutions. However, the inherent ability of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) to explore extensive and complex search spaces makes them particularly effective in scenarios where traditional optimization methodologies may falter. However, EAs explore a vast search space when applied to complex problems. To address the computational bottleneck of evaluating large populations, particularly crucial for complex evolutionary tasks, we introduce a highly efficient evaluation framework. This implementation maintains compatibility with existing primitive definitions, ensuring the generation of valid individuals. Using LLMs, we propose an enhanced evolutionary search strategy that enables a more focused exploration of expansive solution spaces. LLMs facilitate the generation of superior candidate solutions, as evidenced by empirical results demonstrating their efficacy in producing improved outcomes.</p></details> |  |

This survey examines recent advancements in FL-driven LLMs, with a particular emphasis on architectural designs, performance optimization, and security concerns, including the emerging area of machine unlearning. In this context, machine unlearning refers to the systematic removal of specific data contributions from trained models to comply with privacy regulations such as the Right to be Forgotten. We review a range of strategies enabling unlearning in federated LLMs, including perturbation-based methods, model decomposition, and incremental retraining, while evaluating their trade-offs in terms of efficiency, privacy guarantees, and model utility. Through selected case studies and empirical evaluations, we analyze how these methods perform in practical FL scenarios. This survey identifies critical research directions toward developing secure, adaptable, and high-performing federated LLM systems for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Steering Large Language Models with Register Analysis for Arbitrary Style Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00679v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in rewriting text across various styles. However, effectively leveraging this ability for example-based arbitrary style transfer, where an input text is rewritten to match the style of a given exemplar, remains an open challenge. A key question is how to describe the style of the exemplar to guide LLMs toward high-quality rewrites. In this work, we propose a prompting method based on register analysis to guide LLMs to perform this task. Empirical evaluations across multiple style transfer tasks show that our prompting approach enhances style transfer strength while preserving meaning more effectively than existing prompting strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Harnessing LLMs Explanations to Boost Surrogate Models in Tabular Data Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05744v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability in solving complex tasks, making them a promising tool for enhancing tabular learning. However, existing LLM-based methods suffer from high resource requirements, suboptimal demonstration selection, and limited interpretability, which largely hinder their prediction performance and application in the real world. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel in-context learning framework for tabular prediction. The core idea is to leverage the explanations generated by LLMs to guide a smaller, locally deployable Surrogate Language Model (SLM) to make interpretable tabular predictions. Specifically, our framework mainly involves three stages: (i) Post Hoc Explanation Generation, where LLMs are utilized to generate explanations for question-answer pairs in candidate demonstrations, providing insights into the reasoning behind the answer. (ii) Post Hoc Explanation-Guided Demonstrations Selection, which utilizes explanations generated by LLMs to guide the process of demonstration selection from candidate demonstrations. (iii) Post Hoc Explanation-Guided Interpretable SLM Prediction, which utilizes the demonstrations obtained in step (ii) as in-context and merges corresponding explanations as rationales to improve the performance of SLM and guide the model to generate interpretable outputs. Experimental results highlight the framework's effectiveness, with an average accuracy improvement of 5.31% across various tabular datasets in diverse domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Integrated Knowledge Transfer to Large Language Models through Preference Optimization with Biomedical Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05736v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scarcity of high-quality multimodal biomedical data limits the ability to effectively fine-tune pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) for specialized biomedical tasks. To address this challenge, we introduce MINT (Multimodal Integrated kNowledge Transfer), a framework that aligns unimodal large decoder models with domain-specific decision patterns from multimodal biomedical data through preference optimization. While MINT supports different optimization techniques, we primarily implement it with the Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO) framework as its backbone. This strategy enables the aligned LLMs to perform predictive tasks using text-only or image-only inputs while retaining knowledge learnt from multimodal data. MINT leverages an upstream multimodal machine learning (MML) model trained on high-quality multimodal data to transfer domain-specific insights to downstream text-only or image-only LLMs. We demonstrate its effectiveness through two key applications: (1) Rare genetic disease prediction from texts, where MINT uses a multimodal encoder model, trained on facial photos and clinical notes, to generate a preference dataset for aligning a lightweight Llama 3.2-3B-Instruct. Despite relying on text input only, the MINT-derived model outperforms models trained with SFT, RAG, or DPO, and even outperforms Llama 3.1-405B-Instruct. (2) Tissue type classification using cell nucleus images, where MINT uses a vision-language foundation model as the preference generator, containing knowledge learnt from both text and histopathological images to align downstream image-only models. The resulting MINT-derived model significantly improves the performance of Llama 3.2-Vision-11B-Instruct on tissue type classification. In summary, MINT provides an effective strategy to align unimodal LLMs with high-quality multimodal expertise through preference optimization.</p></details> | First Draft |
| **[Understanding Stragglers in Large Model Training Using What-if Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05713v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) training is one of the most demanding distributed computations today, often requiring thousands of GPUs with frequent synchronization across machines. Such a workload pattern makes it susceptible to stragglers, where the training can be stalled by few slow workers. At ByteDance we find stragglers are not trivially always caused by hardware failures, but can arise from multiple complex factors. This work aims to present a comprehensive study on the straggler issues in LLM training, using a five-month trace collected from our ByteDance LLM training cluster. The core methodology is what-if analysis that simulates the scenario without any stragglers and contrasts with the actual case. We use this method to study the following questions: (1) how often do stragglers affect training jobs, and what effect do they have on job performance; (2) do stragglers exhibit temporal or spatial patterns; and (3) what are the potential root causes for stragglers?</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Attacks to Large Language Model Watermarks: Spoofing and Scrubbing in Unauthorized Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17480v3)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Watermarking has emerged as a critical technique for combating misinformation and protecting intellectual property in large language models (LLMs). A recent discovery, termed watermark radioactivity, reveals that watermarks embedded in teacher models can be inherited by student models through knowledge distillation. On the positive side, this inheritance allows for the detection of unauthorized knowledge distillation by identifying watermark traces in student models. However, the robustness of watermarks against scrubbing attacks and their unforgeability in the face of spoofing attacks under unauthorized knowledge distillation remain largely unexplored. Existing watermark attack methods either assume access to model internals or fail to simultaneously support both scrubbing and spoofing attacks. In this work, we propose Contrastive Decoding-Guided Knowledge Distillation (CDG-KD), a unified framework that enables bidirectional attacks under unauthorized knowledge distillation. Our approach employs contrastive decoding to extract corrupted or amplified watermark texts via comparing outputs from the student model and weakly watermarked references, followed by bidirectional distillation to train new student models capable of watermark removal and watermark forgery, respectively. Extensive experiments show that CDG-KD effectively performs attacks while preserving the general performance of the distilled model. Our findings underscore critical need for developing watermarking schemes that are robust and unforgeable.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Text Watermarking based on Lagrange Interpolation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05712v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of LLMs (Large Language Models) has established them as a foundational technology for many AI and ML powered human computer interactions. A critical challenge in this context is the attribution of LLM-generated text, either to the specific language model used or to the individual user who generated it. This is essential for combating misinformation, fake news, misinterpretation, and plagiarism. One of the key techniques for addressing this issue is watermarking. This work presents a watermarking scheme for LLM-generated text based on Lagrange interpolation, which enables the recovery of a secret author identity even when the text has been heavily redacted by an adversary. The core idea is to embed a continuous sequence of points (x, f(x)) that lie on a single straight line. The x-coordinates are generated pseudorandomly using either an LFSR (when security is not a priority) or a cryptographically secure NFSR for high-security applications. The scheme efficiency and resilience to adversarial modifications are analysed. Experimental results show that the proposed method is highly effective, allowing the recovery of the author identity when as few as three points survive adversarial manipulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing Robustness to Spurious Correlations in Post-Training Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05704v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised and preference-based fine-tuning techniques have become popular for aligning large language models (LLMs) with user intent and correctness criteria. However, real-world training data often exhibits spurious correlations -- arising from biases, dataset artifacts, or other "shortcut" features -- that can compromise a model's performance or generalization. In this paper, we systematically evaluate three post-training algorithms -- Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and KTO (Kahneman-Tversky Optimization) -- across a diverse set of synthetic tasks and spuriousness conditions. Our tasks span mathematical reasoning, constrained instruction-following, and document-grounded question answering. We vary the degree of spurious correlation (10% vs. 90%) and investigate two forms of artifacts: "Feature Ambiguity" and "Distributional Narrowness." Our results show that the models often but not always degrade under higher spuriousness. The preference-based methods (DPO/KTO) can demonstrate relative robustness in mathematical reasoning tasks. By contrast, SFT maintains stronger performance in complex, context-intensive tasks. These findings highlight that no single post-training strategy universally outperforms in all scenarios; the best choice depends on the type of target task and the nature of spurious correlations.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR '25 Workshop on Spurious Correlation and Shortcut Learning</p></details> |

We show that existing work for long context inference is largely based on techniques from long context training, and does not handle the high variability in input lengths during inference. This leads to inefficient resource utilization, server fragmentation, and head-of-line (HOL) blocking. We present Medha, an end-to-end system for efficient long-context LLM inference that addresses these challenges through fine-grained time sharing. Medha introduces three key innovations: (1) the mechanism of adaptive prefill chunking to help mitigate HOL blocking with preemption; (2) two new parallelism strategies: Sequence Pipeline Parallelism (SPP) to reduce time-to-first-token by pipelining prefill chunks, and KV-Cache Parallelism (KVP) to lower time-peroutput-token by distributing decoding across servers; and (3) a novel input-length aware least remaining slack scheduling to meet Service Level Objectives (SLOs). Medha enables exact inference scaling beyond 10 million tokens, maintaining high throughput and low latency across mixed-length workloads. Compared to state-of-the-art systems, Medha reduces server fragmentation, cuts median latency by up to 30x, and improves throughput by over 5x, delivering production-scale long-context inference without compromising performance on shorter requests.</p></details> |  |

This technology excels at inferring relationships within vast unstructured or semi-structured datasets. The legal domain here comprises complex data characterized by extensive, interrelated, and semi-structured knowledge systems with complex relations. It comprises constitutions, statutes, regulations, and case law. Extracting insights and navigating the intricate networks of legal documents and their relations is crucial for effective legal research. Here, we introduce a generative AI system that integrates RAG, VS, and KG, constructed via Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), to enhance legal information retrieval and AI reasoning and minimize hallucinations. In the legal system, these technologies empower AI agents to identify and analyze complex connections among cases, statutes, and legal precedents, uncovering hidden relationships and predicting legal trends-challenging tasks that are essential for ensuring justice and improving operational efficiency. Our system employs web scraping techniques to systematically collect legal texts, such as statutes, constitutional provisions, and case law, from publicly accessible platforms like Justia. It bridges the gap between traditional keyword-based searches and contextual understanding by leveraging advanced semantic representations, hierarchical relationships, and latent topic discovery. This framework supports legal document clustering, summarization, and cross-referencing, for scalable, interpretable, and accurate retrieval for semi-structured data while advancing computational law and AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

This paper introduces Miipher-2, an SR model designed for million-hour scale data, for training data cleaning for large-scale generative models like large language models. Key challenges addressed include generalization to unseen languages, operation without explicit conditioning (e.g., text, speaker ID), and computational efficiency. Miipher-2 utilizes a frozen, pre-trained Universal Speech Model (USM), supporting over 300 languages, as a robust, conditioning-free feature extractor. To optimize efficiency and minimize memory, Miipher-2 incorporates parallel adapters for predicting clean USM features from noisy inputs and employs the WaveFit neural vocoder for waveform synthesis. These components were trained on 3,000 hours of multi-lingual, studio-quality recordings with augmented degradations, while USM parameters remained fixed. Experimental results demonstrate Miipher-2's superior or comparable performance to conventional SR models in word-error-rate, speaker similarity, and both objective and subjective sound quality scores across all tested languages. Miipher-2 operates efficiently on consumer-grade accelerators, achieving a real-time factor of 0.0078, enabling the processing of a million-hour speech dataset in approximately three days using only 100 such accelerators.</p></details> |  |

We fine-tune pre-trained video-text foundational models for the specific domain of capuchin monkeys, with the goal of developing useful computational models to help researchers to retrieve useful clips from videos. We focus on the challenging problem of training a model based solely on raw, unlabeled video footage, using weak audio descriptions sometimes provided by field collaborators. We leverage recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to address the extremely noisy nature of both video and audio content. Specifically, we propose a two-folded approach: an agentic data treatment pipeline and a fine-tuning process. The data processing pipeline automatically extracts clean and semantically aligned video-text pairs from the raw videos, which are subsequently used to fine-tune a pre-trained Microsoft's X-CLIP model through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). We obtained an uplift in $Hits@5$ of $167\%$ for the 16 frames model and an uplift of $114\%$ for the 8 frame model on our domain data. Moreover, based on $NDCG@K$ results, our model is able to rank well most of the considered behaviors, while the tested raw pre-trained models are not able to rank them at all. The code will be made available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting Multimedia Generated by Large AI Models: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00045v4)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Large AI Models (LAIMs), particularly diffusion models and large language models, has marked a new era where AI-generated multimedia is increasingly integrated into various aspects of daily life. Although beneficial in numerous fields, this content presents significant risks, including potential misuse, societal disruptions, and ethical concerns. Consequently, detecting multimedia generated by LAIMs has become crucial, with a marked rise in related research. Despite this, there remains a notable gap in systematic surveys that focus specifically on detecting LAIM-generated multimedia. Addressing this, we provide the first survey to comprehensively cover existing research on detecting multimedia (such as text, images, videos, audio, and multimodal content) created by LAIMs. Specifically, we introduce a novel taxonomy for detection methods, categorized by media modality, and aligned with two perspectives: pure detection (aiming to enhance detection performance) and beyond detection (adding attributes like generalizability, robustness, and interpretability to detectors). Additionally, we have presented a brief overview of generation mechanisms, public datasets, online detection tools, and evaluation metrics to provide a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in this field. Most importantly, we offer a focused analysis from a social media perspective to highlight their broader societal impact. Furthermore, we identify current challenges in detection and propose directions for future research that address unexplored, ongoing, and emerging issues in detecting multimedia generated by LAIMs. Our aim for this survey is to fill an academic gap and contribute to global AI security efforts, helping to ensure the integrity of information in the digital realm.

| **[From Bias To Improved Prompts: A Case Study of Bias Mitigation of Clone Detection Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05679v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The issue of clone code has persisted in software engineering, primarily because developers often copy and paste code segments. This common practice has elevated the importance of clone code detection, garnering attention from both software engineering researchers and industry professionals. Their collective concern arises from the potential negative impacts that clone code can have on software quality. The emergence of powerful Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT has exacerbated the clone code problem. These advanced models possess code generation capabilities that can inadvertently create code clones. As a result, the need to detect clone code has become more critical than ever before. In this study, we assess the suitability of LLMs for clone code detection. Our results demonstrate that the Palm model achieved a high F1 score of 89.30 for the avatar dataset and 86.41 for the poolC dataset. A known issue with LLMs is their susceptibility to prompt bias, where the performance of these models fluctuates based on the input prompt provided. In our research, we delve deeper into the reasons behind these fluctuations and propose a framework to mitigate prompt bias for clone detection. Our analysis identifies eight distinct categories of prompt bias, and our devised approach leveraging these biases yields a significant improvement of up to 10.81% in the F1 score. These findings underscore the substantial impact of prompt bias on the performance of LLMs and highlight the potential for leveraging model errors to alleviate this bias.</p></details> |  |

Vision-Based Approaches to Robust Document Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05666v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a popular technique for enhancing the reliability and utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) by grounding responses in external documents. Traditional RAG systems rely on Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to first process scanned documents into text. However, even state-of-the-art OCRs can introduce errors, especially in degraded or complex documents. Recent vision-language approaches, such as ColPali, propose direct visual embedding of documents, eliminating the need for OCR. This study presents a systematic comparison between a vision-based RAG system (ColPali) and more traditional OCR-based pipelines utilizing Llama 3.2 (90B) and Nougat OCR across varying document qualities. Beyond conventional retrieval accuracy metrics, we introduce a semantic answer evaluation benchmark to assess end-to-end question-answering performance. Our findings indicate that while vision-based RAG performs well on documents it has been fine-tuned on, OCR-based RAG is better able to generalize to unseen documents of varying quality. We highlight the key trade-offs between computational efficiency and semantic accuracy, offering practical guidance for RAG practitioners in selecting between OCR-dependent and vision-based document retrieval systems in production environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Stress Testing Black-Box LLM Planners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05665v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated success in generalizing across decision-making tasks including planning, control and prediction, but their tendency to hallucinate unsafe and undesired outputs poses risks. We argue that detecting such failures is necessary, especially in safety-critical scenarios. Existing black-box methods often detect hallucinations by identifying inconsistencies across multiple samples. Many of these approaches typically introduce prompt perturbations like randomizing detail order or generating adversarial inputs, with the intuition that a confident model should produce stable outputs. We first perform a manual case study showing that other forms of perturbations (e.g., adding noise, removing sensor details) cause LLMs to hallucinate in a driving environment. We then propose a novel method for efficiently searching the space of prompt perturbations using Adaptive Stress Testing (AST) with Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Our AST formulation enables discovery of scenarios and prompts that cause language models to act with high uncertainty. By generating MCTS prompt perturbation trees across diverse scenarios, we show that offline analyses can be used at runtime to automatically generate prompts that influence model uncertainty, and to inform real-time trust assessments of an LLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 16 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

In this work, we examine whether sociolect usage by an LLM agent affects user reliance on its outputs and user perception (satisfaction, frustration, trust, and social presence). We designed and conducted user studies where 498 African American English (AAE) speakers and 487 Queer slang speakers performed a set of question-answering tasks with LLM-based suggestions in either standard American English (SAE) or their self-identified sociolect. Our findings showed that sociolect usage by LLMs influenced both reliance and perceptions, though in some surprising ways. Results suggest that both AAE and Queer slang speakers relied more on the SAE agent, and had more positive perceptions of the SAE agent. Yet, only Queer slang speakers felt more social presence from the Queer slang agent over the SAE one, whereas only AAE speakers preferred and trusted the SAE agent over the AAE one. These findings emphasize the need to test for behavioral outcomes rather than simply assume that personalization would lead to a better and safer reliance outcome. They also highlight the nuanced dynamics of minoritized language in machine interactions, underscoring the need for LLMs to be carefully designed to respect cultural and linguistic boundaries while fostering genuine user engagement and trust.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to FAccT 2025</p></details> |

In this study, we conduct the first comprehensive evaluation of machine translation (MT) performance on bug reports, analyzing the capabilities of DeepL, AWS Translate, and large language models such as ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, LLaMA, and Mistral using data from the Visual Studio Code GitHub repository, specifically focusing on reports labeled with the english-please tag. To assess both translation quality and source language identification accuracy, we employ a range of MT evaluation metrics-including BLEU, BERTScore, COMET, METEOR, and ROUGE-alongside classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Our findings reveal that while ChatGPT (gpt-4o) excels in semantic and lexical translation quality, it does not lead in source language identification. Claude and Mistral achieve the highest F1-scores (0.7182 and 0.7142, respectively), and Gemini records the best precision (0.7414). AWS Translate shows the highest accuracy (0.4717) in identifying source languages. These results highlight that no single system dominates across all tasks, reinforcing the importance of task-specific evaluations. This study underscores the need for domain adaptation when translating technical content and provides actionable insights for integrating MT into bug-triaging workflows.

While traditional approaches rely on anonymization and centralized data collection, they often expose raw student data to security vulnerabilities and impose substantial logistical overhead. In this study, we propose a federated learning (FL) framework for automated scoring of educational assessments that eliminates the need to share sensitive data across institutions. Our approach leverages parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), enabling each client (school) to train locally while sharing only optimized model updates. To address data heterogeneity, we implement an adaptive weighted aggregation strategy that considers both client performance and data volume. We benchmark our model against two state-of-the-art FL methods and a centralized learning baseline using NGSS-aligned multi-label science assessment data from nine middle schools. Results show that our model achieves the highest accuracy (94.5%) among FL approaches, and performs within 0.5-1.0 percentage points of the centralized model on these metrics. Additionally, it achieves comparable rubric-level scoring accuracy, with only a 1.3% difference in rubric match and a lower score deviation (MAE), highlighting its effectiveness in preserving both prediction quality and interpretability.</p></details> | Accepted to AIED25 |

These models often fail to fully leverage visual input, defaulting to strong language priors. Our approach first provides insights into how MLLMs internally build visual understanding of image regions and then introduces techniques to amplify this capability. Specifically, we explore techniques designed both to deepen the model's understanding of visual content and to ensure that these visual insights actively guide language generation.

Although existing ground VLN agents achieved notable results in indoor and outdoor settings, they struggle in aerial VLN due to the absence of predefined navigation graphs and the exponentially expanding action space in long-horizon exploration. In this work, we propose \textbf{CityNavAgent}, a large language model (LLM)-empowered agent that significantly reduces the navigation complexity for urban aerial VLN. Specifically, we design a hierarchical semantic planning module (HSPM) that decomposes the long-horizon task into sub-goals with different semantic levels. The agent reaches the target progressively by achieving sub-goals with different capacities of the LLM. Additionally, a global memory module storing historical trajectories into a topological graph is developed to simplify navigation for visited targets. Extensive benchmark experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant improvement. Further experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of different modules of CityNavAgent for aerial VLN in continuous city environments.

| **[LiteLMGuard: Seamless and Lightweight On-Device Prompt Filtering for Safeguarding Small Language Models against Quantization-induced Risks and Vulnerabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05619v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has influenced the development of their lighter counterparts-Small Language Models (SLMs)-to enable on-device deployment across smartphones and edge devices. These SLMs offer enhanced privacy, reduced latency, server-free functionality, and improved user experience. However, due to resource constraints of on-device environment, SLMs undergo size optimization through compression techniques like quantization, which can inadvertently introduce fairness, ethical and privacy risks. Critically, quantized SLMs may respond to harmful queries directly, without requiring adversarial manipulation, raising significant safety and trust concerns. To address this, we propose LiteLMGuard (LLMG), an on-device prompt guard that provides real-time, prompt-level defense for quantized SLMs. Additionally, our prompt guard is designed to be model-agnostic such that it can be seamlessly integrated with any SLM, operating independently of underlying architectures. Our LLMG formalizes prompt filtering as a deep learning (DL)-based prompt answerability classification task, leveraging semantic understanding to determine whether a query should be answered by any SLM. Using our curated dataset, Answerable-or-Not, we trained and fine-tuned several DL models and selected ELECTRA as the candidate, with 97.75% answerability classification accuracy. Our safety effectiveness evaluations demonstrate that LLMG defends against over 87% of harmful prompts, including both direct instruction and jailbreak attack strategies. We further showcase its ability to mitigate the Open Knowledge Attacks, where compromised SLMs provide unsafe responses without adversarial prompting. In terms of prompt filtering effectiveness, LLMG achieves near state-of-the-art filtering accuracy of 94%, with an average latency of 135 ms, incurring negligible overhead for users.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 18 figures, and 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Leveraging Large Language Models for enzymatic reaction prediction and characterization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05616v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting enzymatic reactions is crucial for applications in biocatalysis, metabolic engineering, and drug discovery, yet it remains a complex and resource-intensive task. Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable success in various scientific domains, e.g., through their ability to generalize knowledge, reason over complex structures, and leverage in-context learning strategies. In this study, we systematically evaluate the capability of LLMs, particularly the Llama-3.1 family (8B and 70B), across three core biochemical tasks: Enzyme Commission number prediction, forward synthesis, and retrosynthesis. We compare single-task and multitask learning strategies, employing parameter-efficient fine-tuning via LoRA adapters. Additionally, we assess performance across different data regimes to explore their adaptability in low-data settings. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs capture biochemical knowledge, with multitask learning enhancing forward- and retrosynthesis predictions by leveraging shared enzymatic information. We also identify key limitations, for example challenges in hierarchical EC classification schemes, highlighting areas for further improvement in LLM-driven biochemical modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReplaceMe: Network Simplification via Layer Pruning and Linear Transformations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02819v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce ReplaceMe, a generalized training-free depth pruning method that effectively replaces transformer blocks with a linear operation, while maintaining high performance for low compression ratios. In contrast to conventional pruning approaches that require additional training or fine-tuning, our approach requires only a small calibration dataset that is used to estimate a linear transformation to approximate the pruned blocks. This estimated linear mapping can be seamlessly merged with the remaining transformer blocks, eliminating the need for any additional network parameters. Our experiments show that ReplaceMe consistently outperforms other training-free approaches and remains highly competitive with state-of-the-art pruning methods that involve extensive retraining/fine-tuning and architectural modifications. Applied to several large language models (LLMs), ReplaceMe achieves up to 25% pruning while retaining approximately 90% of the original model's performance on open benchmarks - without any training or healing steps, resulting in minimal computational overhead (see Fig.1). We provide an open-source library implementing ReplaceMe alongside several state-of-the-art depth pruning techniques, available at this repository.</p></details> |  |

Single cell profiling offers insights into cellular heterogeneity, yet the application of large-scale foundation models for predicting drug response in single cell data remains underexplored. To address this, we developed scDrugMap, an integrated framework featuring both a Python command-line interface and a web server for drug response prediction. scDrugMap evaluates a wide range of foundation models, including eight single-cell models and two large language models, using a curated dataset of over 326,000 cells in the primary collection and 18,800 cells in the validation set, spanning 36 datasets and diverse tissue and cancer types. We benchmarked model performance under pooled-data and cross-data evaluation settings, employing both layer freezing and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning strategies. In the pooled-data scenario, scFoundation achieved the best performance, with mean F1 scores of 0.971 (layer freezing) and 0.947 (fine-tuning), outperforming the lowest-performing model by over 50%. In the cross-data setting, UCE excelled post fine-tuning (mean F1: 0.774), while scGPT led in zero-shot learning (mean F1: 0.858). Overall, scDrugMap provides the first large-scale benchmark of foundation models for drug response prediction in single-cell data and serves as a user-friendly, flexible platform for advancing drug discovery and translational research.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |

We will review the main concepts of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and hybrid models. Some important subsets of Machine Learning algorithms such as supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning are also discussed in this paper. These techniques can be used for some important tasks like prediction, classification, and segmentation. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used for image and video processing and many more applications. We dive into the architecture of CNNs and how to integrate CNNs with ML algorithms to build hybrid models. This paper explores the vulnerability of learning algorithms to noise, leading to misclassification. We further discuss the integration of learning algorithms with Large Language Models (LLM) to generate coherent responses applicable to many domains such as healthcare, marketing, and finance by learning important patterns from large volumes of data. Furthermore, we discuss the next generation of learning algorithms and how we may have an unified Adaptive and Dynamic Network to perform important tasks.

Further, advanced AI evaluations often have a nested hierarchical structure, exhibit high levels of complexity, and come with high costs in testing the most advanced AI systems. To address these challenges, we introduce HiBayES, a generalizable Hierarchical Bayesian modeling framework for AI Evaluation Statistics. HiBayES supports robust inferences in classical question-answer benchmarks and advanced agentic evaluations, particularly in low-data scenarios (e.g., < 20 data points per evaluation). Built on Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), Bayesian data analysis, and formal model comparison, HiBayES provides principled uncertainty quantification and robust parameter estimation. This paper offers a comprehensive introduction to HiBayES, including illustrative examples, comparisons to conventional statistical methods, and practical guidance for implementing multilevel Bayesian GLMs. Additionally, we provide a HiBayES software package [4] (Beta version) for out-of-the-box implementation.</p></details> | 23 pages, 9 figures |

However, effective vulnerability detection relies on accurately capturing the semantic structure of code and its contextual relationships. Given that the same functionality can be implemented in various forms, a preprocessing tool that standardizes code representation is important. This tool must be efficient, adaptable across programming languages, and capable of supporting new transformations. To address this challenge, we build on the existing SCoPE framework and introduce SCoPE2, an enhanced version with improved performance. We compare both versions in terms of processing time and memory usage and evaluate their impact on a Large Language Model (LLM) for vulnerability detection. Our results show a 97.3\% reduction in processing time with SCoPE2, along with an improved F1-score for the LLM, solely due to the refined preprocessing approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 tables, DCAI'25: Distributed Computing and Artificial Intelligence 2025</p></details> |

However, its application often results in overly large test suites, as developers generate numerous tests to kill specific mutants, increasing computational overhead. This paper introduces PRIMG (Prioritization and Refinement Integrated Mutation-driven Generation), a novel framework for incremental and adaptive test case generation for Solidity smart contracts. PRIMG integrates two core components: a mutation prioritization module, which employs a machine learning model trained on mutant subsumption graphs to predict the usefulness of surviving mutants, and a test case generation module, which utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate and iteratively refine test cases to achieve syntactic and behavioral correctness. We evaluated PRIMG on real-world Solidity projects from Code4Arena to assess its effectiveness in improving mutation scores and generating high-quality test cases. The experimental results demonstrate that PRIMG significantly reduces test suite size while maintaining high mutation coverage. The prioritization module consistently outperformed random mutant selection, enabling the generation of high-impact tests with reduced computational effort. Furthermore, the refining process enhanced the correctness and utility of LLM-generated tests, addressing their inherent limitations in handling edge cases and complex program logic.</p></details> |  |
| **[AI-Driven Scholarly Peer Review via Persistent Workflow Prompting, Meta-Prompting, and Meta-Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03332v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Critical peer review of scientific manuscripts presents a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), partly due to data limitations and the complexity of expert reasoning. This report introduces Persistent Workflow Prompting (PWP), a potentially broadly applicable prompt engineering methodology designed to bridge this gap using standard LLM chat interfaces (zero-code, no APIs). We present a proof-of-concept PWP prompt for the critical analysis of experimental chemistry manuscripts, featuring a hierarchical, modular architecture (structured via Markdown) that defines detailed analysis workflows. We develop this PWP prompt through iterative application of meta-prompting techniques and meta-reasoning aimed at systematically codifying expert review workflows, including tacit knowledge. Submitted once at the start of a session, this PWP prompt equips the LLM with persistent workflows triggered by subsequent queries, guiding modern reasoning LLMs through systematic, multimodal evaluations. Demonstrations show the PWP-guided LLM identifying major methodological flaws in a test case while mitigating LLM input bias and performing complex tasks, including distinguishing claims from evidence, integrating text/photo/figure analysis to infer parameters, executing quantitative feasibility checks, comparing estimates against claims, and assessing a priori plausibility. To ensure transparency and facilitate replication, we provide full prompts, detailed demonstration analyses, and logs of interactive chats as supplementary resources. Beyond the specific application, this work offers insights into the meta-development process itself, highlighting the potential of PWP, informed by detailed workflow formalization, to enable sophisticated analysis using readily available LLMs for complex scientific tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 36 pages (references and appendixes)</p></details> |

Most previous research on HTC has focused on supervised methods. However, in real-world scenarios, employing supervised HTC can be challenging due to a lack of annotated data. Moreover, HTC often faces issues with large label spaces and long-tail distributions. In this work, we present Knowledge Graphs for zero-shot Hierarchical Text Classification (KG-HTC), which aims to address these challenges of HTC in applications by integrating knowledge graphs with Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide structured semantic context during classification. Our method retrieves relevant subgraphs from knowledge graphs related to the input text using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. Our KG-HTC can enhance LLMs to understand label semantics at various hierarchy levels. We evaluate KG-HTC on three open-source HTC datasets: WoS, DBpedia, and Amazon. Our experimental results show that KG-HTC significantly outperforms three baselines in the strict zero-shot setting, particularly achieving substantial improvements at deeper levels of the hierarchy. This evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of incorporating structured knowledge into LLMs to address HTC's challenges in large label spaces and long-tailed label distributions.

To achieve this, we construct a large-scale, physically stable dataset of LEGO designs, along with their associated captions, and train an autoregressive large language model to predict the next brick to add via next-token prediction. To improve the stability of the resulting designs, we employ an efficient validity check and physics-aware rollback during autoregressive inference, which prunes infeasible token predictions using physics laws and assembly constraints. Our experiments show that LegoGPT produces stable, diverse, and aesthetically pleasing LEGO designs that align closely with the input text prompts. We also develop a text-based LEGO texturing method to generate colored and textured designs. We show that our designs can be assembled manually by humans and automatically by robotic arms. We also release our new dataset, StableText2Lego, containing over 47,000 LEGO structures of over 28,000 unique 3D objects accompanied by detailed captions, along with our code and models at the project website: https://avalovelace1.github.io/LegoGPT/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://avalovelace1.github.io/LegoGPT/</p></details> |

It addresses two fundamental challenges in adapting existing models into online scenarios: (1) limited capability for multi-turn real-time understanding, and (2) lack of proactive response mechanisms. Specifically, StreamBridge incorporates (1) a memory buffer combined with a round-decayed compression strategy, supporting long-context multi-turn interactions, and (2) a decoupled, lightweight activation model that can be effortlessly integrated into existing Video-LLMs, enabling continuous proactive responses. To further support StreamBridge, we construct Stream-IT, a large-scale dataset tailored for streaming video understanding, featuring interleaved video-text sequences and diverse instruction formats. Extensive experiments show that StreamBridge significantly improves the streaming understanding capabilities of offline Video-LLMs across various tasks, outperforming even proprietary models such as GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro. Simultaneously, it achieves competitive or superior performance on standard video understanding benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods suffer from the issues of verbosity and likelihood displacement, which can be driven by the noisy preference pairs that induce similar likelihood for preferred and dispreferred responses. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we propose a new preference alignment method based on comparison oracles and provide the convergence guarantee for its basic scheme. Second, we improve our method using some heuristics and conduct the experiments to demonstrate the flexibility and compatibility of practical scheme in improving the performance of LLMs using noisy preference pairs. Evaluations are conducted across multiple base and instruction-tuned models (Mistral-7B, Llama-3-8B and Gemma-2-9B) with benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2, MT-Bench and Arena-Hard). Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method as an alternative to addressing the limitations of existing direct alignment methods. A highlight of our work is that we evidence the importance of designing specialized methods for preference pairs with distinct likelihood margin, which complements the recent findings in \citet{Razin-2025-Unintentional}.</p></details> | 25 pages |

However, the mechanisms by which these two abilities can be combined and contribute remain poorly understood. In this work, we explore to compose perception and reasoning through model merging that connects parameters of different models. Unlike previous works that often focus on merging models of the same kind, we propose merging models across modalities, enabling the incorporation of the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into VLMs. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that model merging offers a successful pathway to transfer reasoning abilities from LLMs to VLMs in a training-free manner. Moreover, we utilize the merged models to understand the internal mechanism of perception and reasoning and how merging affects it. We find that perception capabilities are predominantly encoded in the early layers of the model, whereas reasoning is largely facilitated by the middle-to-late layers. After merging, we observe that all layers begin to contribute to reasoning, whereas the distribution of perception abilities across layers remains largely unchanged. These observations shed light on the potential of model merging as a tool for multimodal integration and interpretation.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025.

One of their essential characteristics is the ability to be conversationally actionable, allowing humans to interact with the LLM effectively to perform crucial process life cycle tasks such as process model design and redesign. However, most current research focuses on single-prompt execution and evaluation of results, rather than on continuous interaction between the user and the LLM. In this work, we aim to explore the feasibility of using LLMs to empower domain experts in the creation and redesign of process models in an iterative and effective way. The proposed conversational process model redesign (CPD) approach receives as input a process model and a redesign request by the user in natural language. Instead of just letting the LLM make changes, the LLM is employed to (a) identify process change patterns from literature, (b) re-phrase the change request to be aligned with an expected wording for the identified pattern (i.e., the meaning), and then to (c) apply the meaning of the change to the process model. This multi-step approach allows for explainable and reproducible changes. In order to ensure the feasibility of the CPD approach, and to find out how well the patterns from literature can be handled by the LLM, we performed an extensive evaluation. The results show that some patterns are hard to understand by LLMs and by users. Within the scope of the study, we demonstrated that users need support to describe the changes clearly. Overall the evaluation shows that the LLMs can handle most changes well according to a set of completeness and correctness criteria.</p></details> |  |

However, existing research often evaluates these components in isolation-either focusing on a single user simulator or a specific system design-limiting the generalisability of insights across architectures and configurations. In this work, we propose clem todd (chat-optimized LLMs for task-oriented dialogue systems development), a flexible framework for systematically evaluating dialogue systems under consistent conditions. clem todd enables detailed benchmarking across combinations of user simulators and dialogue systems, whether existing models from literature or newly developed ones. It supports plug-and-play integration and ensures uniform datasets, evaluation metrics, and computational constraints. We showcase clem todd's flexibility by re-evaluating existing task-oriented dialogue systems within this unified setup and integrating three newly proposed dialogue systems into the same evaluation pipeline. Our results provide actionable insights into how architecture, scale, and prompting strategies affect dialogue performance, offering practical guidance for building efficient and effective conversational AI systems.</p></details> | 30 pages |

However, current approaches remain limited to textual information, ignoring crucial multimodal cues such as facial expressions and tone of voice that humans naturally use to communicate. Moreover, existing SDG agents primarily focus on inferring other players' identities without modeling how others perceive themselves or fellow players. To address these limitations, we use One Night Ultimate Werewolf (ONUW) as a testbed and present MultiMind, the first framework integrating multimodal information into SDG agents. MultiMind processes facial expressions and vocal tones alongside verbal content, while employing a Theory of Mind (ToM) model to represent each player's suspicion levels toward others. By combining this ToM model with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), our agent identifies communication strategies that minimize suspicion directed at itself. Through comprehensive evaluation in both agent-versus-agent simulations and studies with human players, we demonstrate MultiMind's superior performance in gameplay. Our work presents a significant advancement toward LLM agents capable of human-like social reasoning across multimodal domains.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we introduce GesPrompt, a multimodal XR interface that combines co-speech gestures with speech, allowing end-users to communicate more naturally and accurately with LLM-based copilots in XR environments. By incorporating gestures, GesPrompt extracts spatial-temporal reference from co-speech gestures, reducing the need for precise textual prompts and minimizing cognitive load for end-users. Our contributions include (1) a workflow to integrate gesture and speech input in the XR environment, (2) a prototype VR system that implements the workflow, and (3) a user study demonstrating its effectiveness in improving user communication in VR environments.</p></details> |  |

Model-driven data filtering has increasingly become a primary approach for acquiring high-quality data. However, it still faces two main challenges: (1) the lack of an efficient data verification strategy makes it difficult to provide timely feedback on data quality; and (2) the selection of seed data for training classifiers lacks clear criteria and relies heavily on human expertise, introducing a degree of subjectivity. To address the first challenge, we introduce an efficient verification strategy that enables rapid evaluation of the impact of data on LLM training with minimal computational cost. To tackle the second challenge, we build upon the assumption that high-quality seed data is beneficial for LLM training, and by integrating the proposed verification strategy, we optimize the selection of positive and negative samples and propose an efficient data filtering pipeline. This pipeline not only improves filtering efficiency, classifier quality, and robustness, but also significantly reduces experimental and inference costs. In addition, to efficiently filter high-quality data, we employ a lightweight classifier based on fastText, and successfully apply the filtering pipeline to two widely-used pre-training corpora, FineWeb and Chinese FineWeb datasets, resulting in the creation of the higher-quality Ultra-FineWeb dataset. Ultra-FineWeb contains approximately 1 trillion English tokens and 120 billion Chinese tokens. Empirical results demonstrate that the LLMs trained on Ultra-FineWeb exhibit significant performance improvements across multiple benchmark tasks, validating the effectiveness of our pipeline in enhancing both data quality and training efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>The d...</summary><p>The datasets are available on https://huggingface.co/datasets/openbmb/UltraFineWeb</p></details> |

However, LLMs can generate hallucinations and nonfactual information, undermining their trustworthiness in high-stakes medical tasks. Conformal Prediction (CP) provides a statistically rigorous framework for marginal (average) coverage guarantees but has limited exploration in medical QA. This paper proposes an enhanced CP framework for medical multiple-choice question-answering (MCQA) tasks. By associating the non-conformance score with the frequency score of correct options and leveraging self-consistency, the framework addresses internal model opacity and incorporates a risk control strategy with a monotonic loss function. Evaluated on MedMCQA, MedQA, and MMLU datasets using four off-the-shelf LLMs, the proposed method meets specified error rate guarantees while reducing average prediction set size with increased risk level, offering a promising uncertainty evaluation metric for LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published by Mathematics</p></details> |

In this work, we investigate to what extent English reasoning finetuning with long chain-of-thoughts (CoTs) can generalize across languages. First, we find that scaling up inference compute for English-centric reasoning language models (RLMs) improves multilingual mathematical reasoning across many languages including low-resource languages, to an extent where they outperform models twice their size. Second, we reveal that while English-centric RLM's CoTs are naturally predominantly English, they consistently follow a quote-and-think pattern to reason about quoted non-English inputs. Third, we discover an effective strategy to control the language of long CoT reasoning, and we observe that models reason better and more efficiently in high-resource languages. Finally, we observe poor out-of-domain reasoning generalization, in particular from STEM to cultural commonsense knowledge, even for English. Overall, we demonstrate the potentials, study the mechanisms and outline the limitations of crosslingual generalization of English reasoning test-time scaling. We conclude that practitioners should let English-centric RLMs reason in high-resource languages, while further work is needed to improve reasoning in low-resource languages and out-of-domain contexts.</p></details> |  |

With the rise of large language models in automated news and content creation, there is growing concern that these systems may introduce or even amplify framing biases compared to human authors. In this paper, we explore how framing manifests in both out-of-the-box and fine-tuned LLM-generated news content. Our analysis reveals that, particularly in politically and socially sensitive contexts, LLMs tend to exhibit more pronounced framing than their human counterparts. In addition, we observe significant variation in framing tendencies across different model architectures, with some models displaying notably higher biases. These findings point to the need for effective post-training mitigation strategies and tighter evaluation frameworks to ensure that automated news content upholds the standards of balanced reporting.</p></details> |  |

We introduce AskGNN, a novel approach that bridges this gap by leveraging In-Context Learning (ICL) to integrate graph data and task-specific information into LLMs. AskGNN employs a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-powered structure-enhanced retriever to select labeled nodes across graphs, incorporating complex graph structures and their supervision signals. Our learning-to-retrieve algorithm optimizes the retriever to select example nodes that maximize LLM performance on graph. Experiments across three tasks and seven LLMs demonstrate AskGNN's superior effectiveness in graph task performance, opening new avenues for applying LLMs to graph-structured data without extensive fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

We investigate evaluation strategies and update methods for LLMs as new data becomes available. We introduce a web-scale dataset for time-continual pretraining of LLMs derived from 114 dumps of Common Crawl (CC) - orders of magnitude larger than previous continual language modeling benchmarks. We also design time-stratified evaluations across both general CC data and specific domains (Wikipedia, StackExchange, and code documentation) to assess how well various continual learning methods adapt to new data while retaining past knowledge. Our findings demonstrate that, on general CC data, autoregressive meta-schedules combined with a fixed-ratio replay of older data can achieve comparable held-out loss to re-training from scratch, while requiring significantly less computation (2.6x). However, the optimal balance between incorporating new data and replaying old data differs as replay is crucial to avoid forgetting on generic web data but less so on specific domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at: https://github.com/apple/ml-tic-lm</p></details> |

DSDrive leverages a compact LLM that employs a distillation method to preserve the enhanced reasoning capabilities of a larger-sized vision language model (VLM). To effectively align the reasoning and planning tasks, a waypoint-driven dual-head coordination module is further developed, which synchronizes dataset structures, optimization objectives, and the learning process. By integrating these tasks into a unified framework, DSDrive anchors on the planning results while incorporating detailed reasoning insights, thereby enhancing the interpretability and reliability of the end-to-end pipeline. DSDrive has been thoroughly tested in closed-loop simulations, where it performs on par with benchmark models and even outperforms in many key metrics, all while being more compact in size. Additionally, the computational efficiency of DSDrive (as reflected in its time and memory requirements during inference) has been significantly enhanced. Evidently thus, this work brings promising aspects and underscores the potential of lightweight systems in delivering interpretable and efficient solutions for AD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards the Worst-case Robustness of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19040v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have revealed the vulnerability of large language models to adversarial attacks, where adversaries craft specific input sequences to induce harmful, violent, private, or incorrect outputs. In this work, we study their worst-case robustness, i.e., whether an adversarial example exists that leads to such undesirable outputs. We upper bound the worst-case robustness using stronger white-box attacks, indicating that most current deterministic defenses achieve nearly 0\% worst-case robustness. We propose a general tight lower bound for randomized smoothing using fractional knapsack solvers or 0-1 knapsack solvers, and using them to bound the worst-case robustness of all stochastic defenses. Based on these solvers, we provide theoretical lower bounds for several previous empirical defenses. For example, we certify the robustness of a specific case, smoothing using a uniform kernel, against \textit{any possible attack} with an average $\ell_0$ perturbation of 2.02 or an average suffix length of 6.41.</p></details> |  |

However, existing automated selection methods either depend on computationally expensive gradient-based measures or manually designed heuristics, which may fail to fully exploit the intrinsic attributes of data. In this paper, we propose In-context Learning for Contribution Measurement (ICon), a novel gradient-free method that takes advantage of the implicit fine-tuning nature of in-context learning (ICL) to measure sample contribution without gradient computation or manual indicators engineering. ICon offers a computationally efficient alternative to gradient-based methods and reduces human inductive bias inherent in heuristic-based approaches. ICon comprises three components and identifies high-contribution data by assessing performance shifts under implicit learning through ICL. Extensive experiments on three LLMs across 12 benchmarks and 5 pairwise evaluation sets demonstrate the effectiveness of ICon. Remarkably, on LLaMA3.1-8B, models trained on 15% of ICon-selected data outperform full datasets by 5.42% points and exceed the best performance of widely used selection methods by 2.06% points. We further analyze high-contribution samples selected by ICon, which show both diverse tasks and appropriate difficulty levels, rather than just the hardest ones.</p></details> |  |

We argue that, at present, large language models (LLMs) are inadequate for this purpose, and we propose an ideal technology design aimed at enhancing argumentative skills. This involves re-framing LLMs as tools to exercise our critical thinking rather than replacing them. We introduce the concept of 'reasonable parrots' that embody the fundamental principles of relevance, responsibility, and freedom, and that interact through argumentative dialogical moves. These principles and moves arise out of millennia of work in argumentation theory and should serve as the starting point for LLM-based technology that incorporates basic principles of argumentation.</p></details> |  |

This is particularly relevant in nature, where new species are discovered every year. In this work, we focus on open-vocabulary bird species recognition, where the goal is to classify species based on their descriptions without being constrained to a predefined set of taxonomic categories. Traditional benchmarks like CUB-200-2011 and Birdsnap have been evaluated in a closed-vocabulary paradigm, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios where novel species continually emerge. We show that the performance of current systems when evaluated under settings closely aligned with open-vocabulary drops by a huge margin. To address this gap, we propose a scalable framework integrating structured textual knowledge from Wikipedia articles of 11,202 bird species distilled via GPT-4o into concise, discriminative summaries. We propose Visual Re-ranking Retrieval-Augmented Generation(VR-RAG), a novel, retrieval-augmented generation framework that uses visual similarities to rerank the top m candidates retrieved by a set of multimodal vision language encoders. This allows for the recognition of unseen taxa. Extensive experiments across five established classification benchmarks show that our approach is highly effective. By integrating VR-RAG, we improve the average performance of state-of-the-art Large Multi-Modal Model QWEN2.5-VL by 15.4% across five benchmarks. Our approach outperforms conventional VLM-based approaches, which struggle with unseen species. By bridging the gap between encyclopedic knowledge and visual recognition, our work advances open-vocabulary recognition, offering a flexible, scalable solution for biodiversity monitoring and ecological research.</p></details> | 7 figures |

This includes the LLM, embedding, and ranker models themselves, as well as hyperparameters governing individual RAG components. Yet, collectively optimizing the entire configuration in a RAG or LLM system remains under-explored - especially in multi-objective settings - due to intractably large solution spaces, noisy objective evaluations, and the high cost of evaluations. In this work, we introduce the first approach for multi-objective parameter optimization of cost, latency, safety and alignment over entire LLM and RAG systems. We find that Bayesian optimization methods significantly outperform baseline approaches, obtaining a superior Pareto front on two new RAG benchmark tasks. We conclude our work with important considerations for practitioners who are designing multi-objective RAG systems, highlighting nuances such as how optimal configurations may not generalize across tasks and objectives.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking LLM Faithfulness in RAG with Evolving Leaderboards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04847v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucinations remain a persistent challenge for LLMs. RAG aims to reduce hallucinations by grounding responses in contexts. However, even when provided context, LLMs still frequently introduce unsupported information or contradictions. This paper presents our efforts to measure LLM hallucinations with a focus on summarization tasks, assessing how often various LLMs introduce hallucinations when summarizing documents. We discuss Vectara's existing LLM hallucination leaderboard, based on the Hughes Hallucination Evaluation Model (HHEM). While HHEM and Vectara's Hallucination Leaderboard have garnered great research interest, we examine challenges faced by HHEM and current hallucination detection methods by analyzing the effectiveness of these methods on existing hallucination datasets. To address these limitations, we propose FaithJudge, an LLM-as-a-judge approach guided by few-shot human hallucination annotations, which substantially improves automated LLM hallucination evaluation over current methods. We introduce an enhanced hallucination leaderboard centered on FaithJudge, alongside our current hallucination leaderboard, enabling more reliable benchmarking of LLMs for hallucinations in RAG.</p></details> |  |

Adaptive retrieval aims to retrieve only when necessary, but existing approaches rely on LLM-based uncertainty estimation, which remain inefficient and impractical. In this study, we introduce lightweight LLM-independent adaptive retrieval methods based on external information. We investigated 27 features, organized into 7 groups, and their hybrid combinations. We evaluated these methods on 6 QA datasets, assessing the QA performance and efficiency. The results show that our approach matches the performance of complex LLM-based methods while achieving significant efficiency gains, demonstrating the potential of external information for adaptive retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, complex tasks requiring multi-round retrieval remain challenging, and early attempts tend to be overly optimistic without a good sense of self-skepticism. Current multi-round RAG systems may continue searching even when enough information has already been retrieved, or they may provide incorrect answers without having sufficient information or knowledge. Existing solutions either require large amounts of expensive human-labeled process supervision data or lead to subpar performance. This paper aims to address these limitations by introducing a new framework, \textbf{SIM-RAG}, to explicitly enhance RAG systems' self-awareness and multi-round retrieval capabilities. To train SIM-RAG, we first let a RAG system self-practice multi-round retrieval, augmenting existing question-answer pairs with intermediate inner monologue reasoning steps to generate synthetic training data. For each pair, the system may explore multiple retrieval paths, which are labeled as successful if they reach the correct answer and unsuccessful otherwise. Using this data, we train a lightweight information sufficiency Critic. At inference time, the Critic evaluates whether the RAG system has retrieved sufficient information at each round, guiding retrieval decisions and improving system-level self-awareness through in-context reinforcement learning. Experiments across multiple prominent RAG benchmarks show that SIM-RAG is an effective multi-round RAG solution. Furthermore, this framework is system-efficient, adding a lightweight component to RAG without requiring modifications to existing LLMs or search engines, and data-efficient, eliminating the need for costly human-annotated mid-step retrieval process supervision data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 48th International ACM SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

This results in non-uniform cluster access patterns in disk-based vector search systems, particularly in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. While existing approaches optimize individual queries, they overlook the impact of cluster access patterns, failing to account for the locality effects of queries that access similar clusters. This oversight reduces cache efficiency and increases search latency due to excessive disk I/O. To address this, we introduce CaGR-RAG, a context-aware query grouping mechanism that organizes queries based on shared cluster access patterns. Additionally, it incorporates opportunistic cluster prefetching to minimize cache misses during transitions between query groups, further optimizing retrieval performance. Experimental results show that CaGR-RAG reduces 99th percentile tail latency by up to 51.55% while consistently maintaining a higher cache hit ratio than the baseline.</p></details> |  |

A Survey of Methods and Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20119v2)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has advanced significantly in recent years. The complexity of RAG systems, which involve multiple components-such as indexing, retrieval, and generation-along with numerous other parameters, poses substantial challenges for systematic evaluation and quality enhancement. Previous research highlights that evaluating RAG systems is essential for documenting advancements, comparing configurations, and identifying effective approaches for domain-specific applications. This study systematically reviews 63 academic articles to provide a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art RAG evaluation methodologies, focusing on four key areas: datasets, retrievers, indexing and databases, and the generator component. We observe the feasibility of an automated evaluation approach for each component of a RAG system, leveraging an LLM capable of both generating evaluation datasets and conducting evaluations. In addition, we found that further practical research is essential to provide companies with clear guidance on the do's and don'ts of implementing and evaluating RAG systems. By synthesizing evaluation approaches for key RAG components and emphasizing the creation and adaptation of domain-specific datasets for benchmarking, we contribute to the advancement of systematic evaluation methods and the improvement of evaluation rigor for RAG systems. Furthermore, by examining the interplay between automated approaches leveraging LLMs and human judgment, we contribute to the ongoing discourse on balancing automation and human input, clarifying their respective contributions, limitations, and challenges in achieving robust and reliable evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 Pag...</summary><p>8 Pages.

A clear separation of private information from the LLM training has made RAG the basis for many enterprise LLM workloads as it allows the company to augment LLM's understanding using customers' private documents. Despite its popularity for private documents in enterprise deployments, current RAG benchmarks for validating and optimizing RAG pipelines draw their corpora from public data such as Wikipedia or generic web pages and offer little to no personal context. Seeking to empower more personal and private RAG we release the EnronQA benchmark, a dataset of 103,638 emails with 528,304 question-answer pairs across 150 different user inboxes. EnronQA enables better benchmarking of RAG pipelines over private data and allows for experimentation on the introduction of personalized retrieval settings over realistic data. Finally, we use EnronQA to explore the tradeoff in memorization and retrieval when reasoning over private documents.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Nonetheless, numerous failure instances of RAG in QA still exist. These failures are not solely attributable to the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs); instead, they predominantly arise from the retrieval of inaccurate information for LLMs due to two limitations: (1) Current RAG methods segment the corpus without considering semantics, making it difficult to find relevant context due to impaired correlation between questions and the segments. (2) There is a trade-off between missing essential context with fewer context retrieved and getting irrelevant context with more context retrieved. In this paper, we introduce a RAG framework (SAGE), to overcome these limitations. First, to address the segmentation issue without considering semantics, we propose to train a semantic segmentation model. This model is trained to segment the corpus into semantically complete chunks. Second, to ensure that only the most relevant chunks are retrieved while the irrelevant ones are ignored, we design a chunk selection algorithm to dynamically select chunks based on the decreasing speed of the relevance score, leading to a more relevant selection. Third, to further ensure the precision of the retrieved chunks, we propose letting LLMs assess whether retrieved chunks are excessive or lacking and then adjust the amount of context accordingly. Experiments show that SAGE outperforms baselines by 61.25% in the quality of QA on average. Moreover, by avoiding retrieving noisy context, SAGE lowers the cost of the tokens consumed in LLM inference and achieves a 49.41% enhancement in cost efficiency on average. Additionally, our work offers valuable insights for boosting RAG.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) provides a promising post-training solution by leveraging external knowledge. However, existing medical RAG systems suffer from two key limitations: (1) a lack of modeling for human-like reasoning behaviors during information retrieval, and (2) reliance on suboptimal medical corpora, which often results in the retrieval of irrelevant or noisy snippets. To overcome these challenges, we propose Discuss-RAG, a plug-and-play module designed to enhance the medical QA RAG system through collaborative agent-based reasoning. Our method introduces a summarizer agent that orchestrates a team of medical experts to emulate multi-turn brainstorming, thereby improving the relevance of retrieved content. Additionally, a decision-making agent evaluates the retrieved snippets before their final integration. Experimental results on four benchmark medical QA datasets show that Discuss-RAG consistently outperforms MedRAG, especially significantly improving answer accuracy by up to 16.67% on BioASQ and 12.20% on PubMedQA.

Within financial sectors, modern enterprises increasingly rely on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to address complex compliance requirements in financial document workflows. However, existing solutions struggle to account for the inherent heterogeneity of data (e.g., text, tables, diagrams) and evolving nature of regulatory standards used in financial filings, leading to compromised accuracy in critical information extraction. We propose the FinSage framework as a solution, utilizing a multi-aspect RAG framework tailored for regulatory compliance analysis in multi-modal financial documents. FinSage introduces three innovative components: (1) a multi-modal pre-processing pipeline that unifies diverse data formats and generates chunk-level metadata summaries, (2) a multi-path sparse-dense retrieval system augmented with query expansion (HyDE) and metadata-aware semantic search, and (3) a domain-specialized re-ranking module fine-tuned via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to prioritize compliance-critical content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FinSage achieves an impressive recall of 92.51% on 75 expert-curated questions derived from surpasses the best baseline method on the FinanceBench question answering datasets by 24.06% in accuracy. Moreover, FinSage has been successfully deployed as financial question-answering agent in online meetings, where it has already served more than 1,200 people.</p></details> |  |

The integration of hierarchical structure and temporal evolution into knowledge graphs - along with the concept of comprehensive Text Units - facilitates the construction of richer, interconnected representations of legal knowledge. Through a detailed analysis of Graph RAG and its application to legal norm datasets, this article aims to significantly advance the field of Artificial Intelligence applied to Law, creating opportunities for more effective systems in legal research, legislative analysis, and decision support.</p></details> |  |

Traditional RAG enhancements have explored vertical scaling-assigning subtasks to specialized modules-and horizontal scaling-replicating tasks across multiple agents-to improve performance. However, real-world applications impose diverse Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, involving trade-offs among objectives such as reducing cost, ensuring answer quality, and adhering to specific operational constraints. In this work, we present a systems-oriented approach to multi-agent RAG tailored for real-world Question Answering (QA) applications. By integrating task-specific non-functional requirements-such as answer quality, cost, and latency-into the system, we enable dynamic reconfiguration to meet diverse SLAs. Our method maps these Service Level Objectives (SLOs) to system-level parameters, allowing the generation of optimal results within specified resource constraints. We conduct a case study in the QA domain, demonstrating how dynamic re-orchestration of a multi-agent RAG system can effectively manage the trade-off between answer quality and cost. By adjusting the system based on query intent and operational conditions, we systematically balance performance and resource utilization. This approach allows the system to meet SLOs for various query types, showcasing its practicality for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

It proposes a state-aware dynamic knowledge retrieval mechanism to enhance semantic understanding and knowledge scheduling efficiency in large language models for open-domain question answering and complex generation tasks. The method introduces a multi-level perceptive retrieval vector construction strategy and a differentiable document matching path. These components enable end-to-end joint training and collaborative optimization of the retrieval and generation modules. This effectively addresses the limitations of static RAG structures in context adaptation and knowledge access. Experiments are conducted on the Natural Questions dataset. The proposed structure is thoroughly evaluated across different large models, including GPT-4, GPT-4o, and DeepSeek. Comparative and ablation experiments from multiple perspectives confirm the significant improvements in BLEU and ROUGE-L scores. The approach also demonstrates stronger robustness and generation consistency in tasks involving semantic ambiguity and multi-document fusion. These results highlight its broad application potential and practical value in building high-quality language generation systems.</p></details> |  |

As a result, recent efforts focus on instruction-tuning open-source LLMs, though the potential of combining them with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we are the first to explore a knowledge graph-based (KG) RAG framework for Japanese medical QA small-scale open-source LLMs. Experimental results show that KG-based RAG has only a limited impact on Japanese medical QA using small-scale open-source LLMs. Further case studies reveal that the effectiveness of the RAG is sensitive to the quality and relevance of the external retrieved content. These findings offer valuable insights into the challenges and potential of applying RAG in Japanese medical QA, while also serving as a reference for other low-resource languages.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[W-RAG: Weakly Supervised Dense Retrieval in RAG for Open-domain Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08444v2)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In knowledge-intensive tasks such as open-domain question answering (OpenQA), large language models (LLMs) often struggle to generate factual answers, relying solely on their internal (parametric) knowledge. To address this limitation, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance LLMs by retrieving relevant information from external sources, thereby positioning the retriever as a pivotal component. Although dense retrieval demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, its training poses challenges due to the scarcity of ground-truth evidence, largely attributed to the high costs of human annotation. In this paper, we propose W-RAG, a method that draws weak training signals from the downstream task (such as OpenQA) of an LLM, and fine-tunes the retriever to prioritize passages that most benefit the task. Specifically, we rerank the top-$k$ passages retrieved via BM25 by assessing the probability that the LLM will generate the correct answer for a question given each passage. The highest-ranking passages are then used as positive fine-tuning examples for dense retrieval. We conduct comprehensive experiments across four publicly available OpenQA datasets to demonstrate that our approach enhances both retrieval and OpenQA performance compared to baseline models, achieving results comparable to models fine-tuned with human-labeled data.</p></details> |  |

Pleias-RAG-350m and Pleias-RAG-1B are mid-trained on a large synthetic dataset emulating the retrieval of a wide variety of multilingual open sources from the Common Corpus. They provide native support for citation and grounding with literal quotes and reintegrate multiple features associated with RAG workflows, such as query routing, query reformulation, and source reranking. Pleias-RAG-350m and Pleias-RAG-1B outperform SLMs below 4 billion parameters on standardized RAG benchmarks (HotPotQA, 2wiki) and are competitive with popular larger models, including Qwen-2.5-7B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Gemma-3-4B. They are the only SLMs to date maintaining consistent RAG performance across leading European languages and ensuring systematic reference grounding for statements. Due to their size and ease of deployment on constrained infrastructure and higher factuality by design, the models unlock a range of new use cases for generative AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAG LLMs are Not Safer: A Safety Analysis of Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18041v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efforts to ensure the safety of large language models (LLMs) include safety fine-tuning, evaluation, and red teaming. However, despite the widespread use of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, AI safety work focuses on standard LLMs, which means we know little about how RAG use cases change a model's safety profile. We conduct a detailed comparative analysis of RAG and non-RAG frameworks with eleven LLMs. We find that RAG can make models less safe and change their safety profile. We explore the causes of this change and find that even combinations of safe models with safe documents can cause unsafe generations. In addition, we evaluate some existing red teaming methods for RAG settings and show that they are less effective than when used for non-RAG settings. Our work highlights the need for safety research and red-teaming methods specifically tailored for RAG LLMs.</p></details> | NAACL 2025 |

While many studies focus on evaluating the overall quality of end-to-end RAG systems, there is a gap in understanding the appropriateness of LLMs for the RAG task. To address this, we introduce Trust-Score, a holistic metric that evaluates the trustworthiness of LLMs within the RAG framework. Our results show that various prompting methods, such as in-context learning, fail to effectively adapt LLMs to the RAG task as measured by Trust-Score. Consequently, we propose Trust-Align, a method to align LLMs for improved Trust-Score performance. 26 out of 27 models aligned using Trust-Align substantially outperform competitive baselines on ASQA, QAMPARI, and ELI5. Specifically, in LLaMA-3-8b, Trust-Align outperforms FRONT on ASQA (up 12.56), QAMPARI (up 36.04), and ELI5 (up 17.69). Trust-Align also significantly enhances models' ability to correctly refuse and provide quality citations. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of Trust-Align across different open-weight models, including the LLaMA series (1b to 8b), Qwen-2.5 series (0.5b to 7b), and Phi3.5 (3.8b). We release our code at https://github.com/declare-lab/trust-align.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |

By synergizing retrieval mechanisms with advanced reasoning, LLMs can now tackle increasingly complex problems. This paper presents a systematic review of the collaborative interplay between RAG and reasoning, clearly defining "reasoning" within the RAG context. It construct a comprehensive taxonomy encompassing multi-dimensional collaborative objectives, representative paradigms, and technical implementations, and analyze the bidirectional synergy methods. Additionally, we critically evaluate current limitations in RAG assessment, including the absence of intermediate supervision for multi-step reasoning and practical challenges related to cost-risk trade-offs. To bridge theory and practice, we provide practical guidelines tailored to diverse real-world applications. Finally, we identify promising research directions, such as graph-based knowledge integration, hybrid model collaboration, and RL-driven optimization. Overall, this work presents a theoretical framework and practical foundation to advance RAG systems in academia and industry, fostering the next generation of RAG solutions.</p></details> |  |

As generalized models, LLMs often struggle to provide context-specific information, particularly in areas requiring specialized knowledge. In this work we propose a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based multi-agent LLM system to support analysis and decision-making in the context of natural hazards and extreme weather events. As a proof of concept, we present WildfireGPT, a specialized system focused on wildfire hazards. The architecture employs a user-centered, multi-agent design to deliver tailored risk insights across diverse stakeholder groups. By integrating natural hazard and extreme weather projection data, observational datasets, and scientific literature through an RAG framework, the system ensures both the accuracy and contextual relevance of the information it provides. Evaluation across ten expert-led case studies demonstrates that WildfireGPT significantly outperforms existing LLM-based solutions for decision support.</p></details> |  |

However, fairness and reliability concerns persist, as hallucinations can emerge at both the retrieval and generation stages, affecting users' reasoning and decision-making. Our research explores how tailored warning messages -- whose content depends on the specific context of hallucination -- shape user reasoning and actions in an educational quiz setting. Preliminary findings suggest that while warnings improve accuracy and awareness of high-level hallucinations, they may also introduce cognitive friction, leading to confusion and diminished trust in the system. By examining these interactions, this work contributes to the broader goal of AI-augmented reasoning: developing systems that actively support human reflection, critical thinking, and informed decision-making rather than passive information consumption.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 2025 ACM Workshop on Human-AI Interaction for Augmented Reasoning</p></details> |

However, deviations in reasoning paths or errors in intermediate results, which are common in current RAG methods, may propagate and accumulate throughout the reasoning process, diminishing the accuracy of the answer to complex queries. To address this challenge, we propose the Plan-then-Act-and-Review (PAR RAG) framework, which is organized into three key stages: planning, act, and review, and aims to offer an interpretable and incremental reasoning paradigm for accurate and reliable multi-hop question answering by mitigating error propagation.PAR RAG initially applies a top-down problem decomposition strategy, formulating a comprehensive plan that integrates multiple executable steps from a holistic viewpoint. This approach avoids the pitfalls of local optima common in traditional RAG methods, ensuring the accuracy of the entire reasoning path. Subsequently, PAR RAG incorporates a plan execution mechanism based on multi-granularity verification. By utilizing both coarse-grained similarity information and fine-grained relevant data, the framework thoroughly checks and adjusts intermediate results, ensuring process accuracy while effectively managing error propagation and amplification. Experimental results on multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that the PAR RAG framework substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in key metrics, including EM and F1 scores.</p></details> | 18 pages, 3 figures |

Existing methods, which operate at the document level, fail to effectively filter out such content. We propose LLM-driven chunk filtering, ChunkRAG, a framework that enhances RAG systems by evaluating and filtering retrieved information at the chunk level. Our approach employs semantic chunking to divide documents into coherent sections and utilizes LLM-based relevance scoring to assess each chunk's alignment with the user's query. By filtering out less pertinent chunks before the generation phase, we significantly reduce hallucinations and improve factual accuracy. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing RAG models, achieving higher accuracy on tasks requiring precise information retrieval. This advancement enhances the reliability of RAG systems, making them particularly beneficial for applications like fact-checking and multi-hop reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, Student Research Workshop 2025 (NAACL SRW 2025)</p></details> |

To answer this question, we investigate the efficacy of crowdsourcing for RAG through two complementary studies: response writing and response utility judgment. We present the Crowd RAG Corpus 2025 (CrowdRAG-25), which consists of 903 human-written and 903 LLM-generated responses for the 301 topics of the TREC RAG'24 track, across the three discourse styles 'bulleted list', 'essay', and 'news'. For a selection of 65 topics, the corpus further contains 47,320 pairwise human judgments and 10,556 pairwise LLM judgments across seven utility dimensions (e.g., coverage and coherence). Our analyses give insights into human writing behavior for RAG and the viability of crowdsourcing for RAG evaluation. Human pairwise judgments provide reliable and cost-effective results compared to LLM-based pairwise or human/LLM-based pointwise judgments, as well as automated comparisons with human-written reference responses.

| **[CiteFix: Enhancing RAG Accuracy Through Post-Processing Citation Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15629v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful application of Large Language Models (LLMs), revolutionizing information search and consumption. RAG systems combine traditional search capabilities with LLMs to generate comprehensive answers to user queries, ideally with accurate citations. However, in our experience of developing a RAG product, LLMs often struggle with source attribution, aligning with other industry studies reporting citation accuracy rates of only about 74% for popular generative search engines. To address this, we present efficient post-processing algorithms to improve citation accuracy in LLM-generated responses, with minimal impact on latency and cost. Our approaches cross-check generated citations against retrieved articles using methods including keyword + semantic matching, fine tuned model with BERTScore, and a lightweight LLM-based technique. Our experimental results demonstrate a relative improvement of 15.46% in the overall accuracy metrics of our RAG system. This significant enhancement potentially enables a shift from our current larger language model to a relatively smaller model that is approximately 12x more cost-effective and 3x faster in inference time, while maintaining comparable performance. This research contributes to enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of AI-generated content in information retrieval and summarization tasks which is critical to gain customer trust especially in commercial products.</p></details> |  |

A crucial factor in RAG evaluation is "support", whether the information in the cited documents supports the answer. To this end, we conducted a large-scale comparative study of 45 participant submissions on 36 topics to the TREC 2024 RAG Track, comparing an automatic LLM judge (GPT-4o) against human judges for support assessment. We considered two conditions: (1) fully manual assessments from scratch and (2) manual assessments with post-editing of LLM predictions. Our results indicate that for 56% of the manual from-scratch assessments, human and GPT-4o predictions match perfectly (on a three-level scale), increasing to 72% in the manual with post-editing condition. Furthermore, by carefully analyzing the disagreements in an unbiased study, we found that an independent human judge correlates better with GPT-4o than a human judge, suggesting that LLM judges can be a reliable alternative for support assessment. To conclude, we provide a qualitative analysis of human and GPT-4o errors to help guide future iterations of support assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGIR 2025 (short)</p></details> |
| **[The Great Nugget Recall: Automating Fact Extraction and RAG Evaluation with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15068v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced the capabilities of information access systems, especially with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Nevertheless, the evaluation of RAG systems remains a barrier to continued progress, a challenge we tackle in this work by proposing an automatic evaluation framework that is validated against human annotations. We believe that the nugget evaluation methodology provides a solid foundation for evaluating RAG systems. This approach, originally developed for the TREC Question Answering (QA) Track in 2003, evaluates systems based on atomic facts that should be present in good answers. Our efforts focus on "refactoring" this methodology, where we describe the AutoNuggetizer framework that specifically applies LLMs to both automatically create nuggets and automatically assign nuggets to system answers. In the context of the TREC 2024 RAG Track, we calibrate a fully automatic approach against strategies where nuggets are created manually or semi-manually by human assessors and then assigned manually to system answers. Based on results from a community-wide evaluation, we observe strong agreement at the run level between scores derived from fully automatic nugget evaluation and human-based variants. The agreement is stronger when individual framework components such as nugget assignment are automated independently. This suggests that our evaluation framework provides tradeoffs between effort and quality that can be used to guide the development of future RAG systems. However, further research is necessary to refine our approach, particularly in establishing robust per-topic agreement to diagnose system failures effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in SIGIR 2025.

| **[AlignRAG: An Adaptable Framework for Resolving Misalignments in Retrieval-Aware Reasoning of RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14858v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a foundational paradigm for knowledge-grounded text generation. However, existing RAG pipelines often fail to ensure that the reasoning trajectories align with the evidential constraints imposed by retrieved content. In this paper, we reframe RAG as a problem of retrieval-aware reasoning and identify a core challenge: reasoning misalignment-the mismatch between a model's reasoning trajectory and the retrieved evidence. To address this challenge, we propose AlignRAG, a novel test-time framework that mitigates reasoning misalignment through iterative Critique-Driven Alignment (CDA) steps. In contrast to prior approaches that rely on static training or post-hoc selection, AlignRAG actively refines reasoning trajectories during inference by enforcing fine-grained alignment with evidence. Our framework introduces a new paradigm for retrieval-aware reasoning by: (1) constructing context-rich training corpora; (2) generating contrastive critiques from preference-aware reasoning trajectories; (3) training a dedicated \textit{Critic Language Model (CLM)} to identify reasoning misalignments; and (4) applying CDA steps to optimize reasoning trajectories iteratively. Empirical results demonstrate that AlignRAG consistently outperforms all baselines and could integrate as a plug-and-play module into existing RAG pipelines without further changes. By reconceptualizing RAG as a structured reasoning trajectory and establishing the test-time framework for correcting reasoning misalignments in RAG, AlignRAG provides practical advancements for retrieval-aware generation.</p></details> |  |

This system enables efficient searching for specific government legal notices, making legal information more accessible.

Unlike traditional vulnerabilities, these packages are intentionally designed to deceive users, making detection challenging due to evolving attack methods and the lack of structured datasets. In this work, we empirically evaluate the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and few-shot learning for detecting malicious source code. We fine-tune LLMs on curated datasets and integrate YARA rules, GitHub Security Advisories, and malicious code snippets with the aim of enhancing classification accuracy. We came across a counterintuitive outcome: While RAG is expected to boost up the prediction performance, it fails in the performed evaluation, obtaining a mediocre accuracy. In contrast, few-shot learning is more effective as it significantly improves the detection of malicious code, achieving 97% accuracy and 95% balanced accuracy, outperforming traditional RAG approaches. Thus, future work should expand structured knowledge bases, refine retrieval models, and explore hybrid AI-driven cybersecurity solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been peer-reviewed and accepted for publication to the 29th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE 2025)</p></details> |

Given a user query, RAG pipelines typically first retrieve (R) relevant information from external sources, before invoking a Large Language Model (LLM), augmented (A) with this information, to generate (G) responses. Modern RAG pipelines frequently chain multiple retrieval and generation components, in any order. However, developing effective RAG pipelines is challenging because retrieval and generation components are intertwined, making it hard to identify which component(s) cause errors in the eventual output. The parameters with the greatest impact on output quality often require hours of pre-processing after each change, creating prohibitively slow feedback cycles. To address these challenges, we present RAGGY, a developer tool that combines a Python library of composable RAG primitives with an interactive interface for real-time debugging. We contribute the design and implementation of RAGGY, insights into expert debugging patterns through a qualitative study with 12 engineers, and design implications for future RAG tools that better align with developers' natural workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

When relevant internal documents are unavailable, the system struggles to generate accurate and complete responses. Additionally, using closed-source Large Language Models (LLMs) raises concerns about exposing proprietary information. To address these issues, we propose the Secure Multifaceted-RAG (SecMulti-RAG) framework, which retrieves not only from internal documents but also from two supplementary sources: pre-generated expert knowledge for anticipated queries and on-demand external LLM-generated knowledge. To mitigate security risks, we adopt a local open-source generator and selectively utilize external LLMs only when prompts are deemed safe by a filtering mechanism. This approach enhances completeness, prevents data leakage, and reduces costs. In our evaluation on a report generation task in the automotive industry, SecMulti-RAG significantly outperforms traditional RAG - achieving 79.3 to 91.9 percent win rates across correctness, richness, and helpfulness in LLM-based evaluation, and 56.3 to 70.4 percent in human evaluation. This highlights SecMulti-RAG as a practical and secure solution for enterprise RAG.</p></details> |  |

However, deploying RAG on consumer-grade platforms is challenging due to limited memory and the increasing scale of both models and knowledge bases. In this work, we introduce RAGDoll, a resource-efficient, self-adaptive RAG serving system integrated with LLMs, specifically designed for resource-constrained platforms. RAGDoll exploits the insight that RAG retrieval and LLM generation impose different computational and memory demands, which in a traditional serial workflow result in substantial idle times and poor resource utilization. Based on this insight, RAGDoll decouples retrieval and generation into parallel pipelines, incorporating joint memory placement and dynamic batch scheduling strategies to optimize resource usage across diverse hardware devices and workloads. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAGDoll adapts effectively to various hardware configurations and LLM scales, achieving up to 3.6 times speedup in average latency compared to serial RAG systems based on vLLM.</p></details> |  |

This advancement has enabled their widespread deployment across sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and enterprise applications. RAG mitigates hallucinations by integrating external knowledge, yet introduces privacy risk and security risk, notably data breaching risk and data poisoning risk. While recent studies have explored prompt injection and poisoning attacks, there remains a significant gap in comprehensive research on controlling inbound and outbound query flows to mitigate these threats. In this paper, we propose an AI firewall, ControlNET, designed to safeguard RAG-based LLM systems from these vulnerabilities. ControlNET controls query flows by leveraging activation shift phenomena to detect adversarial queries and mitigate their impact through semantic divergence. We conduct comprehensive experiments on four different benchmark datasets including Msmarco, HotpotQA, FinQA, and MedicalSys using state-of-the-art open source LLMs (Llama3, Vicuna, and Mistral). Our results demonstrate that ControlNET achieves over 0.909 AUROC in detecting and mitigating security threats while preserving system harmlessness. Overall, ControlNET offers an effective, robust, harmless defense mechanism, marking a significant advancement toward the secure deployment of RAG-based LLM systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://ai.zjuicsr.cn/firewall</p></details> |

However, they also exhibit inherent limitations, such as outdated knowledge and susceptibility to hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm to address these issues, but it also introduces new vulnerabilities. Recent efforts have focused on the security of RAG-based LLMs, yet existing attack methods face three critical challenges: (1) their effectiveness declines sharply when only a limited number of poisoned texts can be injected into the knowledge database, (2) they lack sufficient stealth, as the attacks are often detectable by anomaly detection systems, which compromises their effectiveness, and (3) they rely on heuristic approaches to generate poisoned texts, lacking formal optimization frameworks and theoretic guarantees, which limits their effectiveness and applicability. To address these issues, we propose coordinated Prompt-RAG attack (PR-attack), a novel optimization-driven attack that introduces a small number of poisoned texts into the knowledge database while embedding a backdoor trigger within the prompt. When activated, the trigger causes the LLM to generate pre-designed responses to targeted queries, while maintaining normal behavior in other contexts. This ensures both high effectiveness and stealth. We formulate the attack generation process as a bilevel optimization problem leveraging a principled optimization framework to develop optimal poisoned texts and triggers. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PR-Attack, achieving a high attack success rate even with a limited number of poisoned texts and significantly improved stealth compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

CRs can be exploited for analyzing vulnerabilities and experimenting with the effectiveness of devised countermeasures, as well as serving as training environments for building cyber security skills and abilities for IT operators. This paper proposes ARCeR as an innovative solution for the automatic generation and deployment of CRs, starting from user-provided descriptions in a natural language. ARCeR relies on the Agentic RAG paradigm, which allows it to fully exploit state-of-art AI technologies. Experimental results show that ARCeR is able to successfully process prompts even in cases that LLMs or basic RAG systems are not able to cope with. Furthermore, ARCeR is able to target any CR framework provided that specific knowledge is made available to it.</p></details> |  |

In the retail domain, for example, the identification of fast changing and visually highly similar products and their properties are key to automated price-monitoring and product recommendation. This paper presents a novel Visual RAG pipeline that combines the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach and Vision Language Models (VLMs) for few-shot FGC. This Visual RAG pipeline extracts product and promotion data in advertisement leaflets from various retailers and simultaneously predicts fine-grained product ids along with price and discount information. Compared to previous approaches, the key characteristic of the Visual RAG pipeline is that it allows the prediction of novel products without re-training, simply by adding a few class samples to the RAG database. Comparing several VLM back-ends like GPT-4o [23], GPT-4o-mini [24], and Gemini 2.0 Flash [10], our approach achieves 86.8% accuracy on a diverse dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Shared Disk KV Cache Management for Efficient Multi-Instance Inference in RAG-Powered LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11765v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent large language models (LLMs) face increasing inference latency as input context length and model size continue to grow. In particular, the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique, which enhances LLM responses by incorporating external knowledge, exacerbates this issue by significantly increasing the number of input tokens. This expansion in token length leads to a substantial rise in computational overhead, particularly during the prefill stage, resulting in prolonged time-to-first-token (TTFT). To address this issue, this paper proposes a method to reduce TTFT by leveraging a disk-based key-value (KV) cache to lessen the computational burden during the prefill stage. We also introduce a disk-based shared KV cache management system, called Shared RAG-DCache, for multi-instance LLM RAG service environments. This system, together with an optimal system configuration, improves both throughput and latency under given resource constraints. Shared RAG-DCache exploits the locality of documents related to user queries in RAG, as well as the queueing delay in LLM inference services. It proactively generates and stores disk KV caches for query-related documents and shares them across multiple LLM instances to enhance inference performance.

By exploiting the inherent structure of the corpus, graph-based RAG methods further enrich this process by building a knowledge graph index and leveraging the structural nature of graphs. However, current graph-based RAG approaches seldom prioritize the design of graph structures. Inadequately designed graph not only impede the seamless integration of diverse graph algorithms but also result in workflow inconsistencies and degraded performance. To further unleash the potential of graph for RAG, we propose NodeRAG, a graph-centric framework introducing heterogeneous graph structures that enable the seamless and holistic integration of graph-based methodologies into the RAG workflow. By aligning closely with the capabilities of LLMs, this framework ensures a fully cohesive and efficient end-to-end process. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that NodeRAG exhibits performance advantages over previous methods, including GraphRAG and LightRAG, not only in indexing time, query time, and storage efficiency but also in delivering superior question-answering performance on multi-hop benchmarks and open-ended head-to-head evaluations with minimal retrieval tokens.

| **[Towards Automated Safety Requirements Derivation Using Agent-based RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11243v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the automated derivation of safety requirements in a self-driving vehicle use case, leveraging LLMs in combination with agent-based retrieval-augmented generation. Conventional approaches that utilise pre-trained LLMs to assist in safety analyses typically lack domain-specific knowledge. Existing RAG approaches address this issue, yet their performance deteriorates when handling complex queries and it becomes increasingly harder to retrieve the most relevant information. This is particularly relevant for safety-relevant applications. In this paper, we propose the use of agent-based RAG to derive safety requirements and show that the retrieved information is more relevant to the queries. We implement an agent-based approach on a document pool of automotive standards and the Apollo case study, as a representative example of an automated driving perception system. Our solution is tested on a data set of safety requirement questions and answers, extracted from the Apollo data. Evaluating a set of selected RAG metrics, we present and discuss advantages of a agent-based approach compared to default RAG methods.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |
| **[SlowFastVAD: Video Anomaly Detection via Integrating Simple Detector and RAG-Enhanced Vision-Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10320v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) aims to identify unexpected events in videos and has wide applications in safety-critical domains. While semi-supervised methods trained on only normal samples have gained traction, they often suffer from high false alarm rates and poor interpretability. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong multimodal reasoning capabilities, offering new opportunities for explainable anomaly detection. However, their high computational cost and lack of domain adaptation hinder real-time deployment and reliability. Inspired by dual complementary pathways in human visual perception, we propose SlowFastVAD, a hybrid framework that integrates a fast anomaly detector with a slow anomaly detector (namely a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) enhanced VLM), to address these limitations. Specifically, the fast detector first provides coarse anomaly confidence scores, and only a small subset of ambiguous segments, rather than the entire video, is further analyzed by the slower yet more interpretable VLM for elaborate detection and reasoning. Furthermore, to adapt VLMs to domain-specific VAD scenarios, we construct a knowledge base including normal patterns based on few normal samples and abnormal patterns inferred by VLMs. During inference, relevant patterns are retrieved and used to augment prompts for anomaly reasoning. Finally, we smoothly fuse the anomaly confidence of fast and slow detectors to enhance robustness of anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that SlowFastVAD effectively combines the strengths of both fast and slow detectors, and achieves remarkable detection accuracy and interpretability with significantly reduced computational overhead, making it well-suited for real-world VAD applications with high reliability requirements.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Personalization: From RAG to Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10147v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalization has become an essential capability in modern AI systems, enabling customized interactions that align with individual user preferences, contexts, and goals. Recent research has increasingly concentrated on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks and their evolution into more advanced agent-based architectures within personalized settings to enhance user satisfaction. Building on this foundation, this survey systematically examines personalization across the three core stages of RAG: pre-retrieval, retrieval, and generation. Beyond RAG, we further extend its capabilities into the realm of Personalized LLM-based Agents, which enhance traditional RAG systems with agentic functionalities, including user understanding, personalized planning and execution, and dynamic generation. For both personalization in RAG and agent-based personalization, we provide formal definitions, conduct a comprehensive review of recent literature, and summarize key datasets and evaluation metrics. Additionally, we discuss fundamental challenges, limitations, and promising research directions in this evolving field. Relevant papers and resources are continuously updated at https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/Awesome-Personalized-RAG-Agent.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |
| **[RAG-Based Fuzzing of Cross-Architecture Compilers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08967v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>OneAPI is an open standard that supports cross-architecture software development with minimal effort from developers. It brings DPC++ and C++ compilers which need to be thoroughly tested to verify their correctness, reliability, and security. Compilers have numerous code flows and optimization features. This process requires developers with deep understanding of the different compiler flows to craft testcases specific to target paths in the compiler. This testcase creation is a time-consuming and costly process. In this paper, we propose a large-language model (LLM)-based compiler fuzzing tool that integrates the concept of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). This tool automates the testcase generation task and relieves experienced compiler developers from investing time to craft testcase generation patterns. We test our proposed approach on the Intel DPC++/C++ compiler. This compiler compiles SYCL code and allows developers to offload it to different architectures, e.g. GPUs and CPUs from different vendors. Using this tool, we managed to identify 87 SYCL code test cases that lead to output value mismatch or compiler runtime errors when compiled using Intel DPC++ and clang++ compilers and run on different architectures. The testcases and the identified unexpected behaviors of the compilers under test were obtained within only few hours with no prior background on the compiler passes under tests. This tool facilitates efficient compiler fuzzing with reduced developer time requirements via the dynamic testcase creation capability provided by an LLM with RAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Adaptive Vector Index Partitioning Scheme for Low-Latency RAG Pipeline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08930v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance response quality by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with vector databases, enabling external knowledge retrieval to support language model reasoning. While RAG enables efficient question answering with smaller LLMs, existing optimizations for vector search and LLM serving have largely been developed in isolation. As a result, their integration often leads to suboptimal end-to-end performance. ... This paper introduces VectorLiteRAG, an optimized vector index partitioning mechanism designed for RAG systems that enhances the responsiveness of the system by jointly optimizing vector search and LLM serving across CPU and GPU system. A key challenge is to determine which indices and how much of the vector index should reside on the GPU and adjusting LLM batch sizes to balance the pipeline for lower Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and meeting user-defined Service-Level Objectives (SLOs). To address this, we leverage the insight that cluster access in vector databases exhibits access skew, where a subset of clusters are queried significantly more frequently than others. VectorLiteRAG exploits this property through an optimized memory distribution strategy, dynamically allocating the minimum number of vector indices corresponding to frequently accessed clusters onto the GPU HBM to ensure a balanced pipeline with the LLM for high responsiveness. This adaptive partitioning scheme is guided by a statistical model that informs memory allocation and workload distribution. Our evaluation demonstrates that VectorLiteRAG improves vector search responsiveness by 2x, significantly reduces end-to-end TTFT in RAG systems by intelligently balancing memory resources between vector search and LLM execution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Out of Style: RAG's Fragility to Linguistic Variation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08231v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the impressive performance of Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) systems across various NLP benchmarks, their robustness in handling real-world user-LLM interaction queries remains largely underexplored. This presents a critical gap for practical deployment, where user queries exhibit greater linguistic variations and can trigger cascading errors across interdependent RAG components. In this work, we systematically analyze how varying four linguistic dimensions (formality, readability, politeness, and grammatical correctness) impact RAG performance. We evaluate two retrieval models and nine LLMs, ranging from 3 to 72 billion parameters, across four information-seeking Question Answering (QA) datasets. Our results reveal that linguistic reformulations significantly impact both retrieval and generation stages, leading to a relative performance drop of up to 40.41% in Recall@5 scores for less formal queries and 38.86% in answer match scores for queries containing grammatical errors. Notably, RAG systems exhibit greater sensitivity to such variations compared to LLM-only generations, highlighting their vulnerability to error propagation due to linguistic shifts. These findings highlight the need for improved robustness techniques to enhance reliability in diverse user interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A System for Comprehensive Assessment of RAG Frameworks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07803v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a standard paradigm for enhancing the factual accuracy and contextual relevance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating retrieval mechanisms. However, existing evaluation frameworks fail to provide a holistic black-box approach to assessing RAG systems, especially in real-world deployment scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce SCARF (System for Comprehensive Assessment of RAG Frameworks), a modular and flexible evaluation framework designed to benchmark deployed RAG applications systematically. SCARF provides an end-to-end, black-box evaluation methodology, enabling a limited-effort comparison across diverse RAG frameworks. Our framework supports multiple deployment configurations and facilitates automated testing across vector databases and LLM serving strategies, producing a detailed performance report. Moreover, SCARF integrates practical considerations such as response coherence, providing a scalable and adaptable solution for researchers and industry professionals evaluating RAG applications. Using the REST APIs interface, we demonstrate how SCARF can be applied to real-world scenarios, showcasing its flexibility in assessing different RAG frameworks and configurations.

Given the overwhelming volume and inherent complexity of scientific collections, conventional search systems often lack necessary intuitiveness and interactivity, presenting substantial barriers for learners, educators, and researchers. CollEx addresses these limitations by employing state-of-the-art Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) as multimodal agents accessible through an intuitive chat interface. By abstracting complex interactions via specialized agents equipped with advanced tools, CollEx facilitates curiosity-driven exploration, significantly simplifying access to diverse scientific collections and records therein. Our system integrates textual and visual modalities, supporting educational scenarios that are helpful for teachers, pupils, students, and researchers by fostering independent exploration as well as scientific excitement and curiosity. Furthermore, CollEx serves the research community by discovering interdisciplinary connections and complementing visual data. We illustrate the effectiveness of our system through a proof-of-concept application containing over 64,000 unique records across 32 collections from a local scientific collection from a public university.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging LLMs for Utility-Focused Annotation: Reducing Manual Effort for Retrieval and RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05220v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval models typically rely on costly human-labeled query-document relevance annotations for training and evaluation. To reduce this cost and leverage the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in relevance judgments, we aim to explore whether LLM-generated annotations can effectively replace human annotations in training retrieval models. Retrieval usually emphasizes relevance, which indicates "topic-relatedness" of a document to a query, while in RAG, the value of a document (or utility) depends on how it contributes to answer generation. Recognizing this mismatch, some researchers use LLM performance on downstream tasks with documents as labels, but this approach requires manual answers for specific tasks, leading to high costs and limited generalization. In another line of work, prompting LLMs to select useful documents as RAG references eliminates the need for human annotation and is not task-specific. If we leverage LLMs' utility judgments to annotate retrieval data, we may retain cross-task generalization without human annotation in large-scale corpora. Therefore, we investigate utility-focused annotation via LLMs for large-scale retriever training data across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings on the retrieval and RAG tasks. To reduce the impact of low-quality positives labeled by LLMs, we design a novel loss function, i.e., Disj-InfoNCE. Our experiments reveal that: (1) Retrievers trained on utility-focused annotations significantly outperform those trained on human annotations in the out-of-domain setting on both tasks, demonstrating superior generalization capabilities. (2) LLM annotation does not replace human annotation in the in-domain setting. However, incorporating just 20% human-annotated data enables retrievers trained with utility-focused annotations to match the performance of models trained entirely with human annotations.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Diversity Enhances an LLM's Performance in RAG and Long-context Task](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09017v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the challenge of context window limitations, primarily due to the quadratic time complexity of the self-attention mechanism (\(O(N^2)\), where \(N\) denotes the context window length). This constraint impacts tasks such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in question answering (Q\&A) and long context summarization. A common approach involves selecting content with the highest similarity to the query; however, this often leads to redundancy and the exclusion of diverse yet relevant information. Building on principles from Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) and Farthest Point Sampling (FPS), we integrate diversity into the content selection process. Our findings reveal that incorporating diversity substantially increases the recall of selecting relevant sentences or chunks before LLM-based Q\&A and summarization. These results highlight the importance of maintaining diversity in future LLM applications to further improve summarization and Q\&A outcomes.</p></details> |  |

While hierarchical planning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) address some of these challenges, they remain insufficient on their own and a deeper integration is required for achieving more reliable systems. To this end, we propose a neuro-symbolic approach that enhances LLMs-based planners with Knowledge Graph-based RAG for hierarchical plan generation. This method decomposes complex tasks into manageable subtasks, further expanded into executable atomic action sequences. To ensure formal correctness and proper decomposition, we integrate a Symbolic Validator, which also functions as a failure detector by aligning expected and observed world states. Our evaluation against baseline methods demonstrates the consistent significant advantages of integrating hierarchical planning, symbolic verification, and RAG across tasks of varying complexity and different LLMs. Additionally, our experimental setup and novel metrics not only validate our approach for complex planning but also serve as a tool for assessing LLMs' reasoning and compositional capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Accurate and efficient scenario data search is critical for both online vehicle decision-making and planning, and offline scenario generation and simulations, as it allows for leveraging the scenario experiences to improve the overall performance. Especially with the application of large language models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) systems in autonomous driving, urgent requirements are put forward. In this paper, we introduce the Driving-RAG framework to address the challenges of efficient scenario data embedding, search, and applications for RAG systems. Our embedding model aligns fundamental scenario information and scenario distance metrics in the vector space. The typical scenario sampling method combined with hierarchical navigable small world can perform efficient scenario vector search to achieve high efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. In addition, the reorganization mechanism by graph knowledge enhances the relevance to the prompt scenarios and augment LLM generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on typical trajectory planning task for complex interactive scenarios such as ramps and intersections, showcasing its advantages for RAG applications.</p></details> |  |

Producing such semantic co-speech gestures has been a major challenge for the existing neural systems that can generate rhythmic beat gestures, but struggle to produce semantically meaningful gestures. Therefore, we present RAG-Gesture, a diffusion-based gesture generation approach that leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce natural-looking and semantically rich gestures. Our neuro-explicit gesture generation approach is designed to produce semantic gestures grounded in interpretable linguistic knowledge. We achieve this by using explicit domain knowledge to retrieve exemplar motions from a database of co-speech gestures. Once retrieved, we then inject these semantic exemplar gestures into our diffusion-based gesture generation pipeline using DDIM inversion and retrieval guidance at the inference time without any need of training. Further, we propose a control paradigm for guidance, that allows the users to modulate the amount of influence each retrieval insertion has over the generated sequence. Our comparative evaluations demonstrate the validity of our approach against recent gesture generation approaches.

| **[CacheBlend: Fast Large Language Model Serving for RAG with Cached Knowledge Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16444v3)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often incorporate multiple text chunks in their inputs to provide the necessary contexts. To speed up the prefill of the long LLM inputs, one can pre-compute the KV cache of a text and re-use the KV cache when the context is reused as the prefix of another LLM input. However, the reused text chunks are not always the input prefix, which makes precomputed KV caches not directly usable since they ignore the text's cross-attention with the preceding texts. Thus, the benefits of reusing KV caches remain largely unrealized. This paper tackles just one challenge: when an LLM input contains multiple text chunks, how to quickly combine their precomputed KV caches in order to achieve the same generation quality as the expensive full prefill (i.e., without reusing KV cache)? This challenge naturally arises in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) where the input is supplemented with multiple retrieved texts as the context. We present CacheBlend, a scheme that reuses the precomputed KV caches, regardless prefix or not, and selectively recomputes the KV values of a small subset of tokens to partially update each reused KV cache. In the meantime, the small extra delay for recomputing some tokens can be pipelined with the retrieval of KV caches within the same job, allowing CacheBlend to store KV caches in slower devices with more storage capacity while retrieving them without increasing the inference delay. By comparing CacheBlend with the state-of-the-art KV cache reusing schemes on three open-source LLMs of various sizes and four popular benchmark datasets of different tasks, we show that CacheBlend reduces time-to-first-token (TTFT) by 2.2-3.3x and increases the inference throughput by 2.8-5x from full KV recompute without compromising generation quality.

In real-world scenarios, user questions often require retrieving answers that are distributed across multiple tables. GraphRAG has recently attracted much attention for enhancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities by organizing external knowledge to address ad-hoc and complex questions, exemplifying a promising direction for cross-table question answering. In this paper, to address the current gap in available data, we first introduce a multi-table benchmark, MutliTableQA, comprising 60k tables and 25k user queries collected from real-world sources. Then, we propose the first Graph-Table-RAG framework, namely GTR, which reorganizes table corpora into a heterogeneous graph, employs a hierarchical coarse-to-fine retrieval process to extract the most relevant tables, and integrates graph-aware prompting for downstream LLMs' tabular reasoning. Extensive experiments show that GTR exhibits superior cross-table question-answering performance while maintaining high deployment efficiency, demonstrating its real-world practical applicability.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |

Large language models (LLMs) have made it significantly easier to prototype such retrieval and reasoning data pipelines. However, implementing these pipelines efficiently still demands significant effort and has several challenges. This often involves orchestrating heterogeneous data systems, managing data movement, and handling low-level implementation details, e.g., LLM context management. To address these challenges, we introduce FlockMTL: an extension for DBMSs that deeply integrates LLM capabilities and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). FlockMTL includes model-driven scalar and aggregate functions, enabling chained predictions through tuple-level mappings and reductions. Drawing inspiration from the relational model, FlockMTL incorporates: (i) cost-based optimizations, which seamlessly apply techniques such as batching and caching; and (ii) resource independence, enabled through novel SQL DDL abstractions: PROMPT and MODEL, introduced as first-class schema objects alongside TABLE. FlockMTL streamlines the development of knowledge-intensive analytical applications, and its optimizations ease the implementation burden.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Routing RAG: Binding Selective Retrieval with Knowledge Verbalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01018v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Selective retrieval improves retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by reducing distractions from low-quality retrievals and improving efficiency. However, existing approaches under-utilize the inherent knowledge of large language models (LLMs), leading to suboptimal retrieval decisions and degraded generation performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Self-Routing RAG (SR-RAG), a novel framework that binds selective retrieval with knowledge verbalization. SR-RAG enables an LLM to dynamically decide between external retrieval and verbalizing its own parametric knowledge. To this end, we design a multi-task objective that jointly optimizes an LLM on knowledge source selection, knowledge verbalization, and response generation. We further introduce dynamic knowledge source inference via nearest neighbor search to improve the accuracy of knowledge source decision under domain shifts. Fine-tuning three LLMs with SR-RAG significantly improves both their response accuracy and inference latency. Compared to the strongest selective retrieval baseline, SR-RAG reduces retrievals by 29% while improving the performance by 5.1%.</p></details> | Work in Progress |

RAG primarily relies on the query-chunk text-to-text similarity in the embedding space for retrieval and can fail to capture deeper semantic relationships across chunks, is highly sensitive to chunking strategies, and is prone to hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose TOBUGraph, a graph-based retrieval framework that first constructs the knowledge graph from unstructured data dynamically and automatically. Using LLMs, TOBUGraph extracts structured knowledge and diverse relationships among data, going beyond RAG's text-to-text similarity. Retrieval is achieved through graph traversal, leveraging the extracted relationships and structures to enhance retrieval accuracy, eliminating the need for chunking configurations while reducing hallucination. We demonstrate TOBUGraph's effectiveness in TOBU, a real-world application in production for personal memory organization and retrieval. Our evaluation using real user data demonstrates that TOBUGraph outperforms multiple RAG implementations in both precision and recall, significantly improving user experience through improved retrieval accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contradiction Detection in RAG Systems: Evaluating LLMs as Context Validators for Improved Information Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00180v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have emerged as a powerful method for enhancing large language models (LLMs) with up-to-date information. However, the retrieval step in RAG can sometimes surface documents containing contradictory information, particularly in rapidly evolving domains such as news. These contradictions can significantly impact the performance of LLMs, leading to inconsistent or erroneous outputs. This study addresses this critical challenge in two ways. First, we present a novel data generation framework to simulate different types of contradictions that may occur in the retrieval stage of a RAG system. Second, we evaluate the robustness of different LLMs in performing as context validators, assessing their ability to detect contradictory information within retrieved document sets. Our experimental results reveal that context validation remains a challenging task even for state-of-the-art LLMs, with performance varying significantly across different types of contradictions. While larger models generally perform better at contradiction detection, the effectiveness of different prompting strategies varies across tasks and model architectures. We find that chain-of-thought prompting shows notable improvements for some models but may hinder performance in others, highlighting the complexity of the task and the need for more robust approaches to context validation in RAG systems.</p></details> |  |

Using LLaMA 3, we evaluate these approaches on emotion classification and mental health condition detection tasks across two datasets. Fine-tuning achieves the highest accuracy (91% for emotion classification, 80% for mental health conditions) but requires substantial computational resources and large training sets, while prompt engineering and RAG offer more flexible deployment with moderate performance (40-68% accuracy). Our findings provide practical insights for implementing LLM-based solutions in mental health applications, highlighting the trade-offs between accuracy, computational requirements, and deployment flexibility.</p></details> |  |

A robust benchmark dataset must satisfy three key criteria: quality, diversity, and difficulty, which capturing the complexity of reasoning based on hops and the distribution of supporting evidence. In this paper, we propose MHTS (Multi-Hop Tree Structure), a novel dataset synthesis framework that systematically controls multi-hop reasoning complexity by leveraging a multi-hop tree structure to generate logically connected, multi-chunk queries. Our fine-grained difficulty estimation formula exhibits a strong correlation with the overall performance metrics of a RAG system, validating its effectiveness in assessing both retrieval and answer generation capabilities. By ensuring high-quality, diverse, and difficulty-controlled queries, our approach enhances RAG evaluation and benchmarking capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Systematic Knowledge Injection into Large Language Models via Diverse Augmentation for Domain-Specific RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08356v3)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a prominent method for incorporating domain knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs). While RAG enhances response relevance by incorporating retrieved domain knowledge in the context, retrieval errors can still lead to hallucinations and incorrect answers. To recover from retriever failures, domain knowledge is injected by fine-tuning the model to generate the correct response, even in the case of retrieval errors. However, we observe that without systematic knowledge augmentation, fine-tuned LLMs may memorize new information but still fail to extract relevant domain knowledge, leading to poor performance. In this work, we present a novel framework that significantly enhances the fine-tuning process by augmenting the training data in two ways -- context augmentation and knowledge paraphrasing. In context augmentation, we create multiple training samples for a given QA pair by varying the relevance of the retrieved information, teaching the model when to ignore and when to rely on retrieved content. In knowledge paraphrasing, we fine-tune with multiple answers to the same question, enabling LLMs to better internalize specialized knowledge. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting due to fine-tuning, we add a domain-specific identifier to a question and also utilize a replay buffer containing general QA pairs. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our method over existing techniques, achieving up to 10\% relative gain in token-level recall while preserving the LLM's generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 14 tables, to be published in NAACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[Does RAG Introduce Unfairness in LLMs? Evaluating Fairness in Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19804v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has recently gained significant attention for its enhanced ability to integrate external knowledge sources into open-domain question answering (QA) tasks. However, it remains unclear how these models address fairness concerns, particularly with respect to sensitive attributes such as gender, geographic location, and other demographic factors. First, as language models evolve to prioritize utility, like improving exact match accuracy, fairness considerations may have been largely overlooked. Second, the complex, multi-component architecture of RAG methods poses challenges in identifying and mitigating biases, as each component is optimized for distinct objectives. In this paper, we aim to empirically evaluate fairness in several RAG methods. We propose a fairness evaluation framework tailored to RAG, using scenario-based questions and analyzing disparities across demographic attributes. Our experimental results indicate that, despite recent advances in utility-driven optimization, fairness issues persist in both the retrieval and generation stages. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions to address fairness concerns throughout the RAG pipeline. The dataset and code used in this study are publicly available at this GitHub Repository https://github.com/elviswxy/RAG_fairness .</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at COLING 2025</p></details> |
| **[Improving RAG for Personalization with Author Features and Contrastive Examples](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08745v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalization with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) often fails to capture fine-grained features of authors, making it hard to identify their unique traits. To enrich the RAG context, we propose providing Large Language Models (LLMs) with author-specific features, such as average sentiment polarity and frequently used words, in addition to past samples from the author's profile. We introduce a new feature called Contrastive Examples: documents from other authors are retrieved to help LLM identify what makes an author's style unique in comparison to others. Our experiments show that adding a couple of sentences about the named entities, dependency patterns, and words a person uses frequently significantly improves personalized text generation. Combining features with contrastive examples boosts the performance further, achieving a relative 15% improvement over baseline RAG while outperforming the benchmarks. Our results show the value of fine-grained features for better personalization, while opening a new research dimension for including contrastive examples as a complement with RAG. We release our code publicly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Balancing Content Size in RAG-Text2SQL System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15723v3)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising solution for converting natural language queries into SQL commands, enabling seamless database interaction. However, these Text-to-SQL (Text2SQL) systems face inherent limitations, hallucinations, outdated knowledge, and untraceable reasoning. To address these challenges, the integration of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with Text2SQL models has gained traction. RAG serves as a retrieval mechanism, providing essential contextual information, such as table schemas and metadata, to enhance the query generation process. Despite their potential, RAG + Text2SQL systems are susceptible to the quality and size of retrieved documents. While richer document content can improve schema relevance and retrieval accuracy, it also introduces noise, increasing the risk of hallucinations and reducing query fidelity as the prompt size of the Text2SQL model increases. This research investigates the nuanced trade-off between document size and quality, aiming to strike a balance that optimizes system performance. Key thresholds are identified where performance degradation occurs, along with actionable strategies to mitigate these challenges. Additionally, we explore the phenomenon of hallucinations in Text2SQL models, emphasizing the critical role of curated document presentation in minimizing errors. Our findings provide a roadmap for enhancing the robustness of RAG + Text2SQL systems, offering practical insights for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[ExpertRAG: Efficient RAG with Mixture of Experts -- Optimizing Context Retrieval for Adaptive LLM Responses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08744v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>ExpertRAG is a novel theoretical framework that integrates Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to advance the efficiency and accuracy of knowledge-intensive language modeling. We propose a dynamic retrieval gating mechanism coupled with expert routing, enabling the model to selectively consult an external knowledge store or rely on specialized internal experts based on the query's needs. The paper lays out the theoretical foundations of ExpertRAG, including a probabilistic formulation that treats retrieval and expert selection as latent decisions, and mathematical justifications for its efficiency in both computation and knowledge utilization. We derive formulae to quantify the expected computational cost savings from selective retrieval and the capacity gains from sparse expert utilization. A comparative analysis positions ExpertRAG against standard RAG (with always-on retrieval) and pure MoE models (e.g., Switch Transformer, Mixtral) to highlight its unique balance between parametric knowledge and non-parametric retrieval. We also outline an experimental validation strategy, proposing benchmarks and evaluation protocols to test ExpertRAG's performance on factual recall, generalization, and inference efficiency. The proposed framework, although presented theoretically, is supported by insights from prior work in RAG and MoE, and is poised to provide more factual, efficient, and adaptive generation by leveraging the best of both paradigms. In summary, ExpertRAG contributes a new perspective on scaling and augmenting language models, backed by a thorough analysis and a roadmap for empirical validation.</p></details> | 30 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Tuning LLMs by RAG Principles: Towards LLM-native Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16071v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Memory, additional information beyond the training of large language models (LLMs), is crucial to various real-world applications, such as personal assistant. The two mainstream solutions to incorporate memory into the generation process are long-context LLMs and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). In this paper, we first systematically compare these two types of solutions on three renovated/new datasets and show that (1) long-context solutions, although more expensive, shall be easier to capture the big picture and better answer queries which require considering the memory as a whole; and (2) when the queries concern specific information, RAG solutions shall be more competitive especially when the keywords can be explicitly matched. Therefore, we propose a novel method RAG-Tuned-LLM which fine-tunes a relative small (e.g., 7B) LLM using the data generated following the RAG principles, so it can combine the advantages of both solutions. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that RAG-Tuned-LLM can beat long-context LLMs and RAG methods across a wide range of query types.</p></details> |  |

We incorporate a LLM feedback mechanism to improve the quality of the generated content and propose an LLM-as-a-judge approach for evaluation.

The recent purposed Mixed-Precision Over-the-Air Federated Learning (MP-OTA-FL) enables clients to operate at appropriate precision levels based on their heterogeneous hardware, taking advantages of the larger trade-off space while covering the quantization overheads in the mixed-precision modulation scheme for the OTA aggregation process. A key to further exploring the potential of the MP-OTA-FL framework is the optimization of client precision levels. The choice of precision level hinges on multifaceted factors including hardware capability, potential client contribution, and user satisfaction, among which factors can be difficult to define or quantify. In this paper, we propose a RAG-based User Profiling for precision planning framework that integrates retrieval-augmented LLMs and dynamic client profiling to optimize satisfaction and contributions. This includes a hybrid interface for gathering device/user insights and an RAG database storing historical quantization decisions with feedback. Experiments show that our method boosts satisfaction, energy savings, and global model accuracy in MP-OTA-FL systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, submitted to IEEE VTC 2025 fall for possible publication</p></details> |

Chatbots as question-answering systems can help in solving these challenges. LLM chatbots use NLP techniques to establish connections between topics and accurately respond to complex questions. These capabilities make it perfect for enlightenment on religion as a question-answering chatbot. However, LLMs also tend to generate false information, known as hallucination. Also, the chatbots' responses can include content that insults personal religious beliefs, interfaith conflicts, and controversial or sensitive topics. It must avoid such cases without promoting hate speech or offending certain groups of people or their beliefs. This study uses a vector database-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to enhance the accuracy and transparency of LLMs. Our question-answering system is called "MufassirQAS". We created a database consisting of several open-access books that include Turkish context. These books contain Turkish translations and interpretations of Islam. This database is utilized to answer religion-related questions and ensure our answers are trustworthy. The relevant part of the dataset, which LLM also uses, is presented along with the answer. We have put careful effort into creating system prompts that give instructions to prevent harmful, offensive, or disrespectful responses to respect people's values and provide reliable results. The system answers and shares additional information, such as the page number from the respective book and the articles referenced for obtaining the information. MufassirQAS and ChatGPT are also tested with sensitive questions. We got better performance with our system. Study and enhancements are still in progress. Results and future works are given.</p></details> |  |
| **[SOSecure: Safer Code Generation with RAG and StackOverflow Discussions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13654v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for automated code generation. Their reliance on infrequently updated pretraining data leaves them unaware of newly discovered vulnerabilities and evolving security standards, making them prone to producing insecure code. In contrast, developer communities on Stack Overflow (SO) provide an ever-evolving repository of knowledge, where security vulnerabilities are actively discussed and addressed through collective expertise. These community-driven insights remain largely untapped by LLMs. This paper introduces SOSecure, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that leverages the collective security expertise found in SO discussions to improve the security of LLM-generated code. We build a security-focused knowledge base by extracting SO answers and comments that explicitly identify vulnerabilities. Unlike common uses of RAG, SOSecure triggers after code has been generated to find discussions that identify flaws in similar code. These are used in a prompt to an LLM to consider revising the code. Evaluation across three datasets (SALLM, LLMSecEval, and LMSys) show that SOSecure achieves strong fix rates of 71.7%, 91.3%, and 96.7% respectively, compared to prompting GPT-4 without relevant discussions (49.1%, 56.5%, and 37.5%), and outperforms multiple other baselines. SOSecure operates as a language-agnostic complement to existing LLMs, without requiring retraining or fine-tuning, making it easy to deploy. Our results underscore the importance of maintaining active developer forums, which have dropped substantially in usage with LLM adoptions.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we proposed MES-RAG framework, which enhances entity-specific query handling and provides accurate, secure, and consistent responses. MES-RAG introduces proactive security measures that ensure system integrity by applying protections prior to data access. Additionally, the system supports real-time multi-modal outputs, including text, images, audio, and video, seamlessly integrating into existing RAG architectures. Experimental results demonstrate that MES-RAG significantly improves both accuracy and recall, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing the security and utility of question-answering, increasing accuracy to 0.83 (+0.25) on targeted task.

| **[Privacy-Aware RAG: Secure and Isolated Knowledge Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15548v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in real-world applications has heightened concerns about the confidentiality and integrity of their proprietary knowledge bases. These knowledge bases, which play a critical role in enhancing the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly vulnerable to breaches that could compromise sensitive information. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an advanced encryption methodology designed to protect RAG systems from unauthorized access and data leakage. Our approach encrypts both textual content and its corresponding embeddings prior to storage, ensuring that all data remains securely encrypted. This mechanism restricts access to authorized entities with the appropriate decryption keys, thereby significantly reducing the risk of unintended data exposure. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our encryption strategy preserves the performance and functionality of RAG pipelines, ensuring compatibility across diverse domains and applications. To validate the robustness of our method, we provide comprehensive security proofs that highlight its resilience against potential threats and vulnerabilities. These proofs also reveal limitations in existing approaches, which often lack robustness, adaptability, or reliance on open-source models. Our findings suggest that integrating advanced encryption techniques into the design and deployment of RAG systems can effectively enhance privacy safeguards. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on improving security measures for AI-driven services and advocates for stricter data protection standards within RAG architectures.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advancements, LLMs still face significant challenges in reasoning with structured data, handling dynamic knowledge evolution, and mitigating hallucinations, particularly in mission-critical domains. Our proposed RAG-KG-IL framework addresses these limitations by employing a multi-agent architecture that enables continuous knowledge updates, integrates structured knowledge, and incorporates autonomous agents for enhanced explainability and reasoning. The framework utilizes RAG to ensure the generated responses are grounded in verifiable information, while KGs provide structured domain knowledge for improved consistency and depth of understanding. The Incremental Learning approach allows for dynamic updates to the knowledge base without full retraining, significantly reducing computational overhead and improving the model's adaptability. We evaluate the framework using real-world case studies involving health-related queries, comparing it to state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o and a RAG-only baseline. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces hallucination rates and improves answer completeness and reasoning accuracy. The results underscore the potential of combining RAG, KGs, and multi-agent systems to create intelligent, adaptable systems capable of real-time knowledge integration and reasoning in complex domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Relevance Isn't All You Need: Scaling RAG Systems With Inference-Time Compute Via Multi-Criteria Reranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07104v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern Large Language Model (LLM) systems typically rely on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) which aims to gather context that is useful for response generation. These RAG systems typically optimize strictly towards retrieving context that is maximally relevant to the query. However, conventional theory suggests that retrieval systems which seek to maximize context relevance without any additional explicit criteria can create information bottlenecks. We reaffirm this finding in the modern age of LLM's by showing that in standard RAG pipelines, maximizing for context relevance alone can degrade downstream response quality. In response, we show evaluations of existing RAG methods which account for both context relevance and answer quality. These evaluations introduce a novel finding that existing RAG systems scale poorly with inference time compute usage when considering our combined metric. We introduce "RErank BEyond reLevance (REBEL)", which enables RAG systems to scale with inference-time compute via injection of multi-criteria optimization using Chain-of-Thought prompting (and optionally Multi-Turn dialogue). Ultimately, this enables a new performance/speed tradeoff curve, where RAG systems are able to achieve both higher relevance of retrieved contexts and superior answer quality as inference time increases. Code for the implementation of our method in llama-index can be found at the following PR: https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/pull/17590. Code for running experiments using this llama-index implementation can be found at https://github.com/microsoft/REBEL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taxonomic Reasoning for Rare Arthropods: Combining Dense Image Captioning and RAG for Interpretable Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10886v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of pressing climate change challenges and the significant biodiversity loss among arthropods, automated taxonomic classification from organismal images is a subject of intense research. However, traditional AI pipelines based on deep neural visual architectures such as CNNs or ViTs face limitations such as degraded performance on the long-tail of classes and the inability to reason about their predictions. We integrate image captioning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) to enhance biodiversity monitoring, showing particular promise for characterizing rare and unknown arthropod species. While a naive Vision-Language Model (VLM) excels in classifying images of common species, the RAG model enables classification of rarer taxa by matching explicit textual descriptions of taxonomic features to contextual biodiversity text data from external sources. The RAG model shows promise in reducing overconfidence and enhancing accuracy relative to naive LLMs, suggesting its viability in capturing the nuances of taxonomic hierarchy, particularly at the challenging family and genus levels. Our findings highlight the potential for modern vision-language AI pipelines to support biodiversity conservation initiatives, emphasizing the role of comprehensive data curation and collaboration with citizen science platforms to improve species identification, unknown species characterization and ultimately inform conservation strategies.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |

In the Query-Focused Summarization (QFS) task, GraphRAG-based approaches have notably enhanced the comprehensiveness and diversity of generated responses. However, existing GraphRAG-based approaches predominantly focus on coarse-grained information summarization without being aware of the specific query, and the retrieved content lacks sufficient contextual information to generate comprehensive responses. To address the deficiencies of current RAG systems, we propose Context-Aware Fine-Grained Graph RAG (FG-RAG) to enhance the performance of the QFS task. FG-RAG employs Context-Aware Entity Expansion in graph retrieval to expand the coverage of retrieved entities in the graph, thus providing enough contextual information for the retrieved content. Furthermore, FG-RAG utilizes Query-Level Fine-Grained Summarization to incorporate fine-grained details during response generation, enhancing query awareness for the generated summarization. Our evaluation demonstrates that FG-RAG outperforms other RAG systems in multiple metrics of comprehensiveness, diversity, and empowerment when handling the QFS task. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/BuptWululu/FG-RAG.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces ClaimTrust, a propagation-based trust scoring framework that dynamically evaluates the reliability of documents in a RAG system. Using a modified PageRank-inspired algorithm, ClaimTrust propagates trust scores across documents based on relationships derived from extracted factual claims. We preprocess and analyze 814 political news articles from Kaggle's Fake News Detection Dataset to extract 2,173 unique claims and classify 965 meaningful relationships (supporting or contradicting). By representing the dataset as a document graph, ClaimTrust iteratively updates trust scores until convergence, effectively differentiating trustworthy articles from unreliable ones. Our methodology, which leverages embedding-based filtering for efficient claim comparison and relationship classification, achieves a 11.2% of significant connections while maintaining computational scalability. Experimental results demonstrate that ClaimTrust successfully assigns higher trust scores to verified documents while penalizing those containing false information. Future directions include fine-tuned claim extract and compare (Li et al., 2022), parameter optimization, enhanced language model utilization, and robust evaluation metrics to generalize the framework across diverse datasets and domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

To effectively assess their video comprehension capabilities, long video understanding benchmarks, such as Video-MME and MLVU, are proposed. However, these benchmarks directly use uniform frame sampling for testing, which results in significant information loss and affects the accuracy of the evaluations in reflecting the true abilities of MLLMs. To address this, we propose RAG-Adapter, a plug-and-play framework that reduces information loss during testing by sampling frames most relevant to the given question. Additionally, we introduce a Grouped-supervised Contrastive Learning (GCL) method to further enhance sampling effectiveness of RAG-Adapter through fine-tuning on our constructed MMAT dataset. Finally, we test numerous baseline MLLMs on various video understanding benchmarks, finding that RAG-Adapter sampling consistently outperforms uniform sampling (e.g., Accuracy of GPT-4o increases by 9.3 percent on Video-MME), providing a more accurate testing method for long video benchmarks.</p></details> | 37 pages, 36 figures |

Predictive maintenance (PdM) in such settings demands methodologies that are adaptive, transferable, and capable of integrating domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we present RAAD-LLM, a novel framework for adaptive anomaly detection, leveraging large language models (LLMs) integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This approach addresses the aforementioned PdM challenges. By effectively utilizing domain-specific knowledge, RAAD-LLM enhances the detection of anomalies in time series data without requiring fine-tuning on specific datasets. The framework's adaptability mechanism enables it to adjust its understanding of normal operating conditions dynamically, thus increasing detection accuracy. We validate this methodology through a real-world application for a plastics manufacturing plant and the Skoltech Anomaly Benchmark (SKAB). Results show significant improvements over our previous model with an accuracy increase from 70.7% to 88.6% on the real-world dataset. By allowing for the enriching of input series data with semantics, RAAD-LLM incorporates multimodal capabilities that facilitate more collaborative decision-making between the model and plant operators. Overall, our findings support RAAD-LLM's ability to revolutionize anomaly detection methodologies in PdM, potentially leading to a paradigm shift in how anomaly detection is implemented across various industries.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2411.00914</p></details> |

To bridge this gap, we introduce OpenRAG, a RAG framework that is optimized end-to-end by tuning the retriever to capture in-context relevance, enabling adaptation to the diverse and evolving needs. Extensive experiments across a wide range of tasks demonstrate that OpenRAG, by tuning a retriever end-to-end, leads to a consistent improvement of 4.0% over the original retriever, consistently outperforming existing state-of-the-art retrievers by 2.1%. Additionally, our results indicate that for some tasks, an end-to-end tuned 0.2B retriever can achieve improvements that surpass those of RAG-oriented or instruction-tuned 8B large language models (LLMs), highlighting the cost-effectiveness of our approach in enhancing RAG systems.</p></details> |  |

As an essential part of RAG, external knowledge bases are commonly built by extracting structured data from unstructured PDF documents using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However, given the imperfect prediction of OCR and the inherent non-uniform representation of structured data, knowledge bases inevitably contain various OCR noises. In this paper, we introduce OHRBench, the first benchmark for understanding the cascading impact of OCR on RAG systems. OHRBench includes 8,561 carefully selected unstructured document images from seven real-world RAG application domains, along with 8,498 Q&A pairs derived from multimodal elements in documents, challenging existing OCR solutions used for RAG. To better understand OCR's impact on RAG systems, we identify two primary types of OCR noise: Semantic Noise and Formatting Noise and apply perturbation to generate a set of structured data with varying degrees of each OCR noise. Using OHRBench, we first conduct a comprehensive evaluation of current OCR solutions and reveal that none is competent for constructing high-quality knowledge bases for RAG systems. We then systematically evaluate the impact of these two noise types and demonstrate the trend relationship between the degree of OCR noise and RAG performance. Our OHRBench, including PDF documents, Q&As, and the ground truth structured data are released at: https://github.com/opendatalab/OHR-Bench</p></details> | Work in progress |

We demonstrate that RAG systems that operate on databases with untrusted content are vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks we call jamming. An adversary can add a single ``blocker'' document to the database that will be retrieved in response to a specific query and result in the RAG system not answering this query, ostensibly because it lacks relevant information or because the answer is unsafe. We describe and measure the efficacy of several methods for generating blocker documents, including a new method based on black-box optimization. Our method (1) does not rely on instruction injection, (2) does not require the adversary to know the embedding or LLM used by the target RAG system, and (3) does not employ an auxiliary LLM. We evaluate jamming attacks on several embeddings and LLMs and demonstrate that the existing safety metrics for LLMs do not capture their vulnerability to jamming. We then discuss defenses against blocker documents.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in USENIX Security Symposium 2025</p></details> |

However, the specialized nature of biochemical data often necessitates costly domain-specific fine-tuning, posing critical challenges. First, it hinders the application of more flexible general-purpose LLMs in cutting-edge drug discovery tasks. More importantly, it impedes the rapid integration of the vast amounts of scientific data continuously generated through experiments and research. To investigate these challenges, we propose CLADD, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-empowered agentic system tailored to drug discovery tasks. Through the collaboration of multiple LLM agents, CLADD dynamically retrieves information from biomedical knowledge bases, contextualizes query molecules, and integrates relevant evidence to generate responses -- all without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. Crucially, we tackle key obstacles in applying RAG workflows to biochemical data, including data heterogeneity, ambiguity, and multi-source integration. We demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of this framework across a variety of drug discovery tasks, showing that it outperforms general-purpose and domain-specific LLMs as well as traditional deep learning approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Machi...</summary><p>Machine Learning, Drug Discovery</p></details> |

However, these modules are usually separately trained. We argue that a system like RAG that incorporates multiple modules should be jointly optimized to achieve optimal performance. To demonstrate this, we design a specific pipeline called \textbf{SmartRAG} that includes a policy network and a retriever. The policy network can serve as 1) a decision maker that decides when to retrieve, 2) a query rewriter to generate a query most suited to the retriever, and 3) an answer generator that produces the final response with/without the observations. We then propose to jointly optimize the whole system using a reinforcement learning algorithm, with the reward designed to encourage the system to achieve the best performance with minimal retrieval cost. When jointly optimized, all the modules can be aware of how other modules are working and thus find the best way to work together as a complete system. Empirical results demonstrate that the jointly optimized SmartRAG can achieve better performance than separately optimized counterparts.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution to enhance LLMs accuracy by incorporating external knowledge. However, traditional RAG systems struggle with processing complex relational information and multi-step reasoning, limiting their effectiveness in advanced problem-solving tasks. To address these limitations, we propose CogGRAG, a cognition inspired graph-based RAG framework, designed to improve LLMs performance in Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA). Inspired by the human cognitive process of decomposing complex problems and performing self-verification, our framework introduces a three-stage methodology: decomposition, retrieval, and reasoning with self-verification. By integrating these components, CogGRAG enhances the accuracy of LLMs in complex problem solving. We conduct systematic experiments with three LLM backbones on four benchmark datasets, where CogGRAG outperforms the baselines.</p></details> |  |

While RAG enhances MLLMs by grounding responses in query-relevant external knowledge, this reliance poses a critical yet underexplored safety risk: knowledge poisoning attacks, where misinformation or irrelevant knowledge is intentionally injected into external knowledge bases to manipulate model outputs to be incorrect and even harmful. To expose such vulnerabilities in multimodal RAG, we propose MM-PoisonRAG, a novel knowledge poisoning attack framework with two attack strategies: Localized Poisoning Attack (LPA), which injects query-specific misinformation in both text and images for targeted manipulation, and Globalized Poisoning Attack (GPA) to provide false guidance during MLLM generation to elicit nonsensical responses across all queries. We evaluate our attacks across multiple tasks, models, and access settings, demonstrating that LPA successfully manipulates the MLLM to generate attacker-controlled answers, with a success rate of up to 56% on MultiModalQA. Moreover, GPA completely disrupts model generation to 0% accuracy with just a single irrelevant knowledge injection. Our results highlight the urgent need for robust defenses against knowledge poisoning to safeguard multimodal RAG frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/HyeonjeongHa/MM-PoisonRAG</p></details> |
| **[Improving RAG Retrieval via Propositional Content Extraction: a Speech Act Theory Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10654v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When users formulate queries, they often include not only the information they seek, but also pragmatic markers such as interrogative phrasing or polite requests. Although these speech act indicators communicate the user\textquotesingle s intent -- whether it is asking a question, making a request, or stating a fact -- they do not necessarily add to the core informational content of the query itself. This paper investigates whether extracting the underlying propositional content from user utterances -- essentially stripping away the linguistic markers of intent -- can improve retrieval quality in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Drawing upon foundational insights from speech act theory, we propose a practical method for automatically transforming queries into their propositional equivalents before embedding. To assess the efficacy of this approach, we conducted an experimental study involving 63 user queries related to a Brazilian telecommunications news corpus with precomputed semantic embeddings. Results demonstrate clear improvements in semantic similarity between query embeddings and document embeddings at top ranks, confirming that queries stripped of speech act indicators more effectively retrieve relevant content.</p></details> | 19 pages, 4 figures |

Built from heterologous data of NASDAQ 100 companies, FinTMMBench offers three significant advantages. 1) Multi-modal Corpus: It encompasses a hybrid of financial tables, news articles, daily stock prices, and visual technical charts as the corpus. 2) Temporal-aware Questions: Each question requires the retrieval and interpretation of its relevant data over a specific time period, including daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual periods. 3) Diverse Financial Analysis Tasks: The questions involve 10 different tasks, including information extraction, trend analysis, sentiment analysis and event detection, etc. We further propose a novel TMMHybridRAG method, which first leverages LLMs to convert data from other modalities (e.g., tabular, visual and time-series data) into textual format and then incorporates temporal information in each node when constructing graphs and dense indexes. Its effectiveness has been validated in extensive experiments, but notable gaps remain, highlighting the challenges presented by our FinTMMBench.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Beyond RAG: Task-Aware KV Cache Compression for Comprehensive Knowledge Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04973v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incorporating external knowledge in large language models (LLMs) enhances their utility across diverse applications, but existing methods have trade-offs. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) fetches evidence via similarity search, but key information may fall outside top ranked results. Long-context models can process multiple documents but are computationally expensive and limited by context window size. Inspired by students condensing study material for open-book exams, we propose task-aware key-value (KV) cache compression, which compresses external knowledge in a zero- or few-shot setup. This enables LLMs to reason efficiently over a compacted representation of all relevant information. Experiments show our approach outperforms both RAG and task-agnostic compression methods. On LongBench v2, it improves accuracy by up to 7 absolute points over RAG with a 30x compression rate, while reducing inference latency from 0.43s to 0.16s. A synthetic dataset highlights that RAG performs well when sparse evidence suffices, whereas task-aware compression is superior for broad knowledge tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[More Documents, Same Length: Isolating the Challenge of Multiple Documents in RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04388v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) provides LLMs with relevant documents. Although previous studies noted that retrieving many documents can degrade performance, they did not isolate how the quantity of documents affects performance while controlling for context length. We evaluate various language models on custom datasets derived from a multi-hop QA task. We keep the context length and position of relevant information constant while varying the number of documents, and find that increasing the document count in RAG settings poses significant challenges for LLMs. Additionally, our results indicate that processing multiple documents is a separate challenge from handling long contexts. We also make the datasets and code available: https://github.com/shaharl6000/MoreDocsSameLen .</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[In-depth Analysis of Graph-based RAG in a Unified Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04338v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has proven effective in integrating external knowledge into large language models (LLMs), improving their factual accuracy, adaptability, interpretability, and trustworthiness. A number of graph-based RAG methods have been proposed in the literature. However, these methods have not been systematically and comprehensively compared under the same experimental settings. In this paper, we first summarize a unified framework to incorporate all graph-based RAG methods from a high-level perspective. We then extensively compare representative graph-based RAG methods over a range of questing-answering (QA) datasets -- from specific questions to abstract questions -- and examine the effectiveness of all methods, providing a thorough analysis of graph-based RAG approaches. As a byproduct of our experimental analysis, we are also able to identify new variants of the graph-based RAG methods over specific QA and abstract QA tasks respectively, by combining existing techniques, which outperform the state-of-the-art methods. Finally, based on these findings, we offer promising research opportunities. We believe that a deeper understanding of the behavior of existing methods can provide new valuable insights for future research.</p></details> |  |
