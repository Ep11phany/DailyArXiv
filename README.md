| **[DISCO Balances the Scales: Adaptive Domain- and Difficulty-Aware Reinforcement Learning on Imbalanced Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15074v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly aligned with human preferences through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Among RLHF methods, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has gained attention for its simplicity and strong performance, notably eliminating the need for a learned value function. However, GRPO implicitly assumes a balanced domain distribution and uniform semantic alignment across groups, assumptions that rarely hold in real-world datasets. When applied to multi-domain, imbalanced data, GRPO disproportionately optimizes for dominant domains, neglecting underrepresented ones and resulting in poor generalization and fairness. We propose Domain-Informed Self-Consistency Policy Optimization (DISCO), a principled extension to GRPO that addresses inter-group imbalance with two key innovations. Domain-aware reward scaling counteracts frequency bias by reweighting optimization based on domain prevalence. Difficulty-aware reward scaling leverages prompt-level self-consistency to identify and prioritize uncertain prompts that offer greater learning value. Together, these strategies promote more equitable and effective policy learning across domains. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and skewed training distributions show that DISCO improves generalization, outperforms existing GRPO variants by 5% on Qwen3 models, and sets new state-of-the-art results on multi-domain alignment benchmarks. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Tonyzhou98/disco_grpo.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Reference Visual Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02876v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual grounding focuses on detecting objects from images based on language expressions. Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have significantly advanced visual grounding performance by training large models with large-scale datasets. However, the problem remains challenging, especially when similar objects appear in the input image. For example, an LVLM may not be able to differentiate Diet Coke and regular Coke in an image. In this case, if additional reference images of Diet Coke and regular Coke are available, it can help the visual grounding of similar objects. In this work, we introduce a new task named Multimodal Reference Visual Grounding (MRVG). In this task, a model has access to a set of reference images of objects in a database. Based on these reference images and a language expression, the model is required to detect a target object from a query image. We first introduce a new dataset to study the MRVG problem. Then we introduce a novel method, named MRVG-Net, to solve this visual grounding problem. We show that by efficiently using reference images with few-shot object detection and using Large Language Models (LLMs) for object matching, our method achieves superior visual grounding performance compared to the state-of-the-art LVLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL-72B. Our approach bridges the gap between few-shot detection and visual grounding, unlocking new capabilities for visual understanding, which has wide applications in robotics.

| **[Video models are zero-shot learners and reasoners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20328v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable zero-shot capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have propelled natural language processing from task-specific models to unified, generalist foundation models. This transformation emerged from simple primitives: large, generative models trained on web-scale data. Curiously, the same primitives apply to today's generative video models. Could video models be on a trajectory towards general-purpose vision understanding, much like LLMs developed general-purpose language understanding? We demonstrate that Veo 3 can solve a broad variety of tasks it wasn't explicitly trained for: segmenting objects, detecting edges, editing images, understanding physical properties, recognizing object affordances, simulating tool use, and more. These abilities to perceive, model, and manipulate the visual world enable early forms of visual reasoning like maze and symmetry solving. Veo's emergent zero-shot capabilities indicate that video models are on a path to becoming unified, generalist vision foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://video-zero-shot.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[RAG Security and Privacy: Formalizing the Threat Model and Attack Surface](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20324v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an emerging approach in natural language processing that combines large language models (LLMs) with external document retrieval to produce more accurate and grounded responses. While RAG has shown strong potential in reducing hallucinations and improving factual consistency, it also introduces new privacy and security challenges that differ from those faced by traditional LLMs. Existing research has demonstrated that LLMs can leak sensitive information through training data memorization or adversarial prompts, and RAG systems inherit many of these vulnerabilities. At the same time, reliance of RAG on an external knowledge base opens new attack surfaces, including the potential for leaking information about the presence or content of retrieved documents, or for injecting malicious content to manipulate model behavior. Despite these risks, there is currently no formal framework that defines the threat landscape for RAG systems. In this paper, we address a critical gap in the literature by proposing, to the best of our knowledge, the first formal threat model for retrieval-RAG systems. We introduce a structured taxonomy of adversary types based on their access to model components and data, and we formally define key threat vectors such as document-level membership inference and data poisoning, which pose serious privacy and integrity risks in real-world deployments. By establishing formal definitions and attack models, our work lays the foundation for a more rigorous and principled understanding of privacy and security in RAG systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 5th ICDM Workshop on September 20, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Targeted Adversarial Attacks on Large Vision-Language Models via Intermediate Projector](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13739v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) raises safety concerns, as adversaries may exploit model vulnerabilities to induce harmful outputs, with targeted black-box adversarial attacks posing a particularly severe threat. However, existing methods primarily maximize encoder-level global similarity, which lacks the granularity for stealthy and practical fine-grained attacks, where only specific target should be altered (e.g., modifying a car while preserving its background). Moreover, they largely neglect the projector, a key semantic bridge in VLMs for multimodal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose a novel black-box targeted attack framework that leverages the projector. Specifically, we utilize the widely adopted Querying Transformer (Q-Former) which transforms global image embeddings into fine-grained query outputs, to enhance attack effectiveness and granularity. For standard global targeted attack scenarios, we propose the Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA), which aligns Q-Former fine-grained query outputs with the target to enhance attack strength and exploits the intermediate pretrained Q-Former that is not fine-tuned for any specific Large Language Model (LLM) to improve attack transferability. For fine-grained attack scenarios, we augment IPGA with the Residual Query Alignment (RQA) module, which preserves unrelated content by constraining non-target query outputs to enhance attack granularity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IPGA significantly outperforms baselines in global targeted attacks, and IPGA with RQA (IPGA-R) attains superior success rates and unrelated content preservation over baselines in fine-grained attacks. Our method also transfers effectively to commercial VLMs such as Google Gemini and OpenAI GPT.</p></details> |  |
| **[SIM-CoT: Supervised Implicit Chain-of-Thought](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20317v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Implicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods present a promising, token-efficient alternative to explicit CoT reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs), but a persistent performance gap has limited the application of implicit CoT. We identify a core latent instability issue by scaling the computational budget of implicit CoT approaches: as we increase the number of implicit reasoning tokens to enhance performance, the training process often becomes unstable and collapses. Our analysis reveals that this instability arises from the latent representations becoming homogeneous and losing their semantic diversity, a failure caused by insufficient step-level supervision in existing implicit CoT approaches. To address this issue, we propose SIM-CoT, a plug-and-play training module that introduces step-level supervision to stabilize and enrich the latent reasoning space. Specifically, SIM-CoT employs an auxiliary decoder during training to align each implicit token with its corresponding explicit reasoning step, ensuring that latent states capture distinct and meaningful information. The proposed auxiliary decoder is removed during inference, preserving the computational efficiency of implicit CoT methods with no added overhead. In addition, the auxiliary decoder affords interpretability of implicit reasoning by projecting each latent token onto an explicit reasoning vocabulary, enabling per-step visualization of semantic roles and diagnosis. SIM-CoT significantly enhances both the in-domain accuracy and out-of-domain stability of various implicit CoT methods, boosting baselines like Coconut by +8.2% on GPT-2 and CODI by +3.0% on LLaMA-3.1 8B. Demonstrating strong scalability, SIM-CoT also surpasses the explicit CoT baseline on GPT-2 by 2.1% with 2.3\times greater token efficiency, while substantially closing the performance gap on larger models like LLaMA-3.1 8B.</p></details> |  |
| **[A GEN AI Framework for Medical Note Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01841v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing administrative burden of medical documentation, particularly through Electronic Health Records (EHR), significantly reduces the time available for direct patient care and contributes to physician burnout. To address this issue, we propose MediNotes, an advanced generative AI framework designed to automate the creation of SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) notes from medical conversations. MediNotes integrates Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) to capture and process both text and voice inputs in real time or from recorded audio, generating structured and contextually accurate medical notes. The framework also incorporates advanced techniques like Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for efficient model fine-tuning in resource-constrained environments. Additionally, MediNotes offers a query-based retrieval system, allowing healthcare providers and patients to access relevant medical information quickly and accurately. Evaluations using the ACI-BENCH dataset demonstrate that MediNotes significantly improves the accuracy, efficiency, and usability of automated medical documentation, offering a robust solution to reduce the administrative burden on healthcare professionals while improving the quality of clinical workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 Fig...</summary><p>8 Figures, 7 page, IEEE standard research paper</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models for Automated Medical Documentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09324v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific research indicates that for every hour spent in direct patient care, physicians spend nearly two additional hours on administrative tasks, particularly on electronic health records (EHRs) and desk work. This excessive administrative burden not only reduces the time available for patient care but also contributes to physician burnout and inefficiencies in healthcare delivery. To address these challenges, this study introduces MediGen, a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) designed to automate the generation of medical reports from medical dialogues. By leveraging state-of-the-art methodologies for fine-tuning open-source pretrained models, including LLaMA3-8B, MediGen achieves high accuracy in transcribing and summarizing clinical interactions. The fine-tuned LLaMA3-8B model demonstrated promising results, achieving a ROUGE score of 58% and a BERTScore-F1 of 72%, indicating its effectiveness in generating accurate and clinically relevant medical reports. These findings suggest that MediGen has the potential to significantly reduce the administrative workload on physicians, improving both healthcare efficiency and physician well-being.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 3 Figures, 3 Tables.

| **[UNComp: Can Matrix Entropy Uncover Sparsity? -- A Compressor Design from an Uncertainty-Aware Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03090v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying large language models (LLMs) for long-context inference remains challenging due to their substantial memory and computational demands. While techniques such as Key-Value (KV) cache compression are designed to reduce memory usage, they often neglect the structured sparsity inherent in the relationship between hidden states and their corresponding KV cache. In this work, we explore the role of uncertainty as a potential indicator of sparsity within LLMs. We propose UNComp, an uncertainty-aware framework that leverages truncated matrix entropy to identify areas of low information content, thereby revealing sparsity patterns that can be used for adaptive compression. Unlike traditional methods that apply uniform compression, UNComp dynamically adjusts its approach to compression, guided by uncertainty measures that reflect the importance of various model components. Our analysis shows that sparsity patterns, when derived from uncertainty estimates, can be exploited to reveal special long-range dependencies, such as retrieval heads and retrieval layers. This perspective not only enhances our understanding of how compression can be optimized but also provides new insights into the inherent sparsity of LLMs during long-context inference. By focusing on uncertainty to analyze the sparsity pattern in detail, UNComp reduces the KV cache size to 4.74% of the original, achieves a 6% prefill speedup, and improves throughput by 6.4x - not only delivering strong lossless compression performance, but also validating the effectiveness of the underlying theoretical tool. We release the code at https://github.com/menik1126/UNComp.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 (Main Conference)</p></details> |
| **[White-Basilisk: A Hybrid Model for Code Vulnerability Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08540v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of software vulnerabilities presents a significant challenge to cybersecurity, necessitating more effective detection methodologies. We introduce White-Basilisk, a novel approach to vulnerability detection that demonstrates superior performance while challenging prevailing assumptions in AI model scaling. Utilizing an innovative architecture that integrates Mamba layers, linear self-attention, and a Mixture of Experts framework, White-Basilisk achieves state-of-the-art results in vulnerability detection tasks with a parameter count of only 200M. The model's capacity to process sequences of unprecedented length enables comprehensive analysis of extensive codebases in a single pass, surpassing the context limitations of current Large Language Models (LLMs). White-Basilisk exhibits robust performance on imbalanced, real-world datasets, while maintaining computational efficiency that facilitates deployment across diverse organizational scales. This research not only establishes new benchmarks in code security but also provides empirical evidence that compact, efficiently designed models can outperform larger counterparts in specialized tasks, potentially redefining optimization strategies in AI development for domain-specific applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Expert Specialization for Better MoE](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22323v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enable efficient scaling of large language models (LLMs) by activating only a subset of experts per input. However, we observe that the commonly used auxiliary load balancing loss often leads to expert overlap and overly uniform routing, which hinders expert specialization and degrades overall performance during post-training. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective solution that introduces two complementary objectives: (1) an orthogonality loss to encourage experts to process distinct types of tokens, and (2) a variance loss to encourage more discriminative routing decisions. Gradient-level analysis demonstrates that these objectives are compatible with the existing auxiliary loss and contribute to optimizing the training process. Experimental results over various model architectures and across multiple benchmarks show that our method significantly enhances expert specialization. Notably, our method improves classic MoE baselines with auxiliary loss by up to 23.79%, while also maintaining load balancing in downstream tasks, without any architectural modifications or additional components. We will release our code to contribute to the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>33pag...</summary><p>33pages, 6figures(Accepted by Neurips 2026 Oral)</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing RAG Efficiency with Adaptive Context Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22931v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge but incurs significant inference costs due to lengthy retrieved contexts. While context compression mitigates this issue, existing methods apply fixed compression rates, over-compressing simple queries or under-compressing complex ones. We propose Adaptive Context Compression for RAG (ACC-RAG), a framework that dynamically adjusts compression rates based on input complexity, optimizing inference efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. ACC-RAG combines a hierarchical compressor (for multi-granular embeddings) with a context selector to retain minimal sufficient information, akin to human skimming. Evaluated on Wikipedia and five QA datasets, ACC-RAG outperforms fixed-rate methods and matches/unlocks over 4 times faster inference versus standard RAG while maintaining or improving accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Powered AI Tutors with Personas for d/Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Online Learners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09873v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) using artificial intelligence (AI) technology have shown promise in supporting learners with diverse abilities. Large language models (LLMs) provide new opportunities to incorporate personas to AI-based tutors and support dynamic interactive dialogue. This paper explores how DHH learners interact with LLM-powered AI tutors with different experiences in DHH education as personas to identify their accessibility preferences. A user study with 16 DHH participants showed that they asked DHH-related questions based on background information and evaluated the AI tutors' cultural knowledge of the DHH communities in their responses. Participants suggested providing more transparency in each AI tutor's position within the DHH community. Participants also pointed out the lack of support in the multimodality of sign language in current LLMs. We discuss design implications to support the diverse needs in interaction between DHH users and the LLMs, such as offering supports in tuning language styles of LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Instruction Boundary: Quantifying Biases in LLM Reasoning under Various Coverage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20278v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-language-model (LLM) reasoning has long been regarded as a powerful tool for problem solving across domains, providing non-experts with valuable advice. However, their limitations - especially those stemming from prompt design - remain underexplored. Because users may supply biased or incomplete prompts - often unintentionally - LLMs can be misled, undermining reliability and creating risks. We refer to this vulnerability as the Instruction Boundary. To investigate the phenomenon, we distill it into eight concrete facets and introduce BiasDetector, a framework that measures biases arising from three instruction types: complete, redundant, and insufficient. We evaluate several mainstream LLMs and find that, despite high headline accuracy, substantial biases persist in many downstream tasks as a direct consequence of prompt coverage. Our empirical study confirms that LLM reasoning reliability can still be significantly improved. We analyze the practical impact of these biases and outline mitigation strategies. Our findings underscore the need for developers to tackle biases and for users to craft options carefully.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating Security Implications of Automatically Generated Code on the Software Supply Chain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20277v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, various software supply chain (SSC) attacks have posed significant risks to the global community. Severe consequences may arise if developers integrate insecure code snippets that are vulnerable to SSC attacks into their products. Particularly, code generation techniques, such as large language models (LLMs), have been widely utilized in the developer community. However, LLMs are known to suffer from inherent issues when generating code, including fabrication, misinformation, and reliance on outdated training data, all of which can result in serious software supply chain threats. In this paper, we investigate the security threats to the SSC that arise from these inherent issues. We examine three categories of threats, including eleven potential SSC-related threats, related to external components in source code, and continuous integration configuration files. We find some threats in LLM-generated code could enable attackers to hijack software and workflows, while some others might cause potential hidden threats that compromise the security of the software over time. To understand these security impacts and severity, we design a tool, SSCGuard, to generate 439,138 prompts based on SSC-related questions collected online, and analyze the responses of four popular LLMs from GPT and Llama. Our results show that all identified SSC-related threats persistently exist. To mitigate these risks, we propose a novel prompt-based defense mechanism, namely Chain-of-Confirmation, to reduce fabrication, and a middleware-based defense that informs users of various SSC threats.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scan-do Attitude: Towards Autonomous CT Protocol Management using a Large Language Model Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20270v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Managing scan protocols in Computed Tomography (CT), which includes adjusting acquisition parameters or configuring reconstructions, as well as selecting postprocessing tools in a patient-specific manner, is time-consuming and requires clinical as well as technical expertise. At the same time, we observe an increasing shortage of skilled workforce in radiology. To address this issue, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent framework is proposed to assist with the interpretation and execution of protocol configuration requests given in natural language or a structured, device-independent format, aiming to improve the workflow efficiency and reduce technologists' workload. The agent combines in-context-learning, instruction-following, and structured toolcalling abilities to identify relevant protocol elements and apply accurate modifications. In a systematic evaluation, experimental results indicate that the agent can effectively retrieve protocol components, generate device compatible protocol definition files, and faithfully implement user requests. Despite demonstrating feasibility in principle, the approach faces limitations regarding syntactic and semantic validity due to lack of a unified device API, and challenges with ambiguous or complex requests. In summary, the findings show a clear path towards LLM-based agents for supporting scan protocol management in CT imaging.</p></details> |  |

In biochemistry, molecule screening assays evaluate candidate molecules' functional responses against disease targets. Unstructured text that describes the biological mechanisms through which these targets operate, experimental screening protocols, and other attributes of assays offer rich information for drug discovery campaigns but has been untapped because of that unstructured format. We present Assay2Mol, a large language model-based workflow that can capitalize on the vast existing biochemical screening assays for early-stage drug discovery. Assay2Mol retrieves existing assay records involving targets similar to the new target and generates candidate molecules using in-context learning with the retrieved assay screening data. Assay2Mol outperforms recent machine learning approaches that generate candidate ligand molecules for target protein structures, while also promoting more synthesizable molecule generation.</p></details> | 26 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Segmented Operations using Matrix Multiplications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23906v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Specialized computational units that perform small matrix multiplications as primitive operations are typically present in modern AI accelerators. However, these Matrix Multiplication Units (MMUs) are often underutilized for many fundamental deep learning operations besides dense matrix multiplications. Coincidentally, the lack of a rigorous theoretical model of computation for such architectures obstructs algorithmic design. In this work, we propose MMV-RAM, a computational model which judiciously extends the Vector-RAM model with an additional MMU. We provide a detailed theoretical analysis and carefully balance the computational power between the matrix and vector units, guided by the circuit complexity lower bound that parity is not in AC{[0]}. Given MMV-RAM, we proceed to algorithm design, starting with two fundamental parallel operations: segmented scan and sum. By expressing them as compositions of elementary parallel primitives (e.g., seg. sum reduces to: scan, compress, and vector differentiation), we can exploit MMUs to perform speculative blocked computations, ultimately leading to provable theoretical speed-ups against vector-only approaches. These results extend to other ubiquitous AI kernels, including dense matrix product, and sparse matrix-vector product. As a case study, we implemented the proposed algorithms on the Ascend 910B AI accelerator, which contains matrix and vector cores. We evaluate these implementations on synthetic and real-world datasets from various applications, including Large Language Models.</p></details> |  |

Among RL-based post-training methods, group relative advantage estimation, as exemplified by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), has attracted considerable attention for eliminating the dependency on the value model, thereby simplifying training compared to traditional approaches like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). However, we observe that exsiting group relative advantage estimation method still suffers from training inefficiencies, particularly when the estimated advantage approaches zero. To address this limitation, we propose Advantage-Augmented Policy Optimization (AAPO), a novel RL algorithm that optimizes the cross-entropy (CE) loss using advantages enhanced through a momentum-based estimation scheme. This approach effectively mitigates the inefficiencies associated with group relative advantage estimation. Experimental results on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of AAPO.</p></details> | 18 pages, 4 figures |

However, existing LLM-based AR guidance often lacks rich visual augmentations to effectively embed instructions into spatial context for a better user understanding. We present Guided Reality, a fully automated AR system that generates embedded and dynamic visual guidance based on step-by-step instructions. Our system integrates LLMs and vision models to: 1) generate multi-step instructions from user queries, 2) identify appropriate types of visual guidance, 3) extract spatial information about key interaction points in the real world, and 4) embed visual guidance in physical space to support task execution. Drawing from a corpus of user manuals, we define five categories of visual guidance and propose an identification strategy based on the current step. We evaluate the system through a user study (N=16), completing real-world tasks and exploring the system in the wild. Additionally, four instructors shared insights on how Guided Reality could be integrated into their training workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at UIST 2025</p></details> |
| **[CANDLE: A Cross-Modal Agentic Knowledge Distillation Framework for Interpretable Sarcopenia Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21179v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background and Aims: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable generalization and transfer capabilities by learning from vast corpora of text and web data. Their semantic representations allow cross-task knowledge transfer and reasoning, offering promising opportunities for data-scarce and heterogeneous domains such as clinical medicine. Yet, in diagnostic tasks like sarcopenia, major challenges remain: interpretability, transparency, and deployment efficiency. Traditional machine learning (TML) models provide stable performance and feature-level attribution, ensuring traceable and auditable decision logic, but lack semantic breadth. Conversely, LLMs enable flexible inference but often function as opaque predictors. Existing integration strategies remain shallow, rarely embedding the structured reasoning of TML into LLM inference. Methods: Using sarcopenia diagnosis as a case study, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were extracted from a baseline XGBoost model and transformed into structured, LLM-compatible representations. An actor-critic reinforcement learning (RL) strategy guided the LLM to reason over these SHAP-based inputs, producing calibrated rationales and refined decision rules. The distilled reasoning was consolidated into a structured knowledge repository and deployed via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for case-based inference. Results: (Omitted here.) Conclusion: By coupling SHAP-derived statistical evidence with reinforcement-trained LLM reasoning, CANDLE mitigates the interpretability-performance trade-off, enhances predictive accuracy, and preserves high decision consistency. The framework offers a scalable approach to knowledge assetization of TML models, enabling interpretable, reproducible, and clinically aligned decision support in sarcopenia and potentially broader medical domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

This paper presents an iterative meta-prompting methodology designed to optimise hard prompts without exposing proprietary or confidential context to the LLM. Through a novel regeneration process involving feeder and propagation methods, we demonstrate significant improvements in prompt efficacy. Evaluated on public datasets serving as proxies for financial tasks such as SQuAD for extractive financial Q&A, CNN/DailyMail for news summarisation, and SAMSum for client interaction summarisation, our approach, utilising GPT-3.5 Turbo, achieved a 103.87% improvement in ROUGE-L F1 for question answering. This work highlights a practical, low-cost strategy for adapting LLMs to financial applications while upholding critical privacy and auditability standards, offering a compelling case for its relevance in the evolving landscape of generative AI in finance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Long Video Understanding with Learnable Retrieval in Video-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04931v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable natural language understanding, reasoning, and generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have made them attractive for application to video understanding, utilizing video tokens as contextual input. However, employing LLMs for long video understanding presents significant challenges. The extensive number of video tokens leads to considerable computational costs for LLMs while using aggregated tokens results in loss of vision details. Moreover, the presence of abundant question-irrelevant tokens introduces noise to the video reasoning process. To address these issues, we introduce a simple yet effective learnable retrieval-based video-language model (R-VLM) for efficient long video understanding. Specifically, given a question (query) and a long video, our model identifies and selects the most relevant K video chunks and uses their associated visual tokens to serve as context for the LLM inference. This effectively reduces the number of video tokens, eliminates noise interference, and enhances system performance. We achieve this by incorporating a learnable lightweight MLP block to facilitate the efficient retrieval of question-relevant chunks, through the end-to-end training of our video-language model with a proposed soft matching loss.

Weight-only PTQ is crucial for reducing the memory footprint and latency of LLM inference, especially in memory-bound, small-batch inference scenarios, such as personalized inference on edge devices. Despite its importance, irregular weight distributions with heavy-tailed outliers in LLMs complicate quantization, recently motivating rotation-based methods that transform weights into near-Gaussian distributions, which are more regular with fewer outliers, thereby reducing quantization error. In this work, we first derive the information-theoretically optimal bit allocation for Gaussianized weights under given bit budgets, revealing that fine-grained fractional-bit quantizers approaching the Gaussian distortion-rate bound are essential to achieve near-optimal quantization performance. To bridge this theoretical insight and practical implementation, we introduce Q-Palette, a versatile collection of fractional-bit quantizers that range from trellis-coded quantizers offering near-optimal distortion to simpler vector and scalar quantizers optimized for faster inference, all efficiently implemented with optimized CUDA kernels across various bitwidths. Furthermore, leveraging Q-Palette as a foundational component, we propose a novel mixed-scheme quantization framework, jointly optimizing quantizer choices and layer fusion decisions given resource constraints.

| **[LLMs Reproduce Stereotypes of Sexual and Gender Minorities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05926v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A large body of research has found substantial gender bias in NLP systems. Most of this research takes a binary, essentialist view of gender: limiting its variation to the categories _men_ and _women_, conflating gender with sex, and ignoring different sexual identities. But gender and sexuality exist on a spectrum, so in this paper we study the biases of large language models (LLMs) towards sexual and gender minorities beyond binary categories. Grounding our study in a widely used social psychology model -- the Stereotype Content Model -- we demonstrate that English-language survey questions about social perceptions elicit more negative stereotypes of sexual and gender minorities from both humans and LLMs. We then extend this framework to a more realistic use case: text generation. Our analysis shows that LLMs generate stereotyped representations of sexual and gender minorities in this setting, showing that they amplify representational harms in creative writing, a widely advertised use for LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, 9 tables (including bibliography and appendix).

We introduce a reference-free, token-level hallucination detection framework that leverages the variance in token log-probabilities across multiple stochastic generations. Unlike prior methods that require ground-truth references or sentence-level verification, our approach is model-agnostic, interpretable, and suited for real-time or post-hoc analysis. We evaluate our method on unanswerable question prompts from the SQuAD v2 dataset and benchmark across three autoregressive models of varying scales: GPT-Neo 125M, Falcon 1B, and Mistral 7B. Through both quantitative metrics and visual diagnostics, we show that token-level variance reliably highlights instability in model outputs and correlates with hallucination patterns. Our framework is lightweight, reproducible, and adaptable to multiple domains, offering a valuable diagnostic tool for analyzing generative reliability in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[STAF: Leveraging LLMs for Automated Attack Tree-Based Security Test Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20190v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In modern automotive development, security testing is critical for safeguarding systems against increasingly advanced threats. Attack trees are widely used to systematically represent potential attack vectors, but generating comprehensive test cases from these trees remains a labor-intensive, error-prone task that has seen limited automation in the context of testing vehicular systems. This paper introduces STAF (Security Test Automation Framework), a novel approach to automating security test case generation. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and a four-step self-corrective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, STAF automates the generation of executable security test cases from attack trees, providing an end-to-end solution that encompasses the entire attack surface. We particularly show the elements and processes needed to provide an LLM to actually produce sensible and executable automotive security test suites, along with the integration with an automated testing framework. We further compare our tailored approach with general purpose (vanilla) LLMs and the performance of different LLMs (namely GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek) using our approach. We also demonstrate the method of our operation step-by-step in a concrete case study. Our results show significant improvements in efficiency, accuracy, scalability, and easy integration in any workflow, marking a substantial advancement in automating automotive security testing methodologies. Using TARAs as an input for verfication tests, we create synergies by connecting two vital elements of a secure automotive development process.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 2 figures, accepted for 23rd escar Europe (Nov 05-06, 2025, Frankfurt, Germany)</p></details> |
| **[Thinking Augmented Pre-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20186v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a simple and scalable approach to improve the data efficiency of large language model (LLM) training by augmenting existing text data with thinking trajectories. The compute for pre-training LLMs has been growing at an unprecedented rate, while the availability of high-quality data remains limited. Consequently, maximizing the utility of available data constitutes a significant research challenge. A primary impediment is that certain high-quality tokens are difficult to learn given a fixed model capacity, as the underlying rationale for a single token can be exceptionally complex and deep. To address this issue, we propose Thinking augmented Pre-Training (TPT), a universal methodology that augments text with automatically generated thinking trajectories. Such augmentation effectively increases the volume of the training data and makes high-quality tokens more learnable through step-by-step reasoning and decomposition. We apply TPT across diverse training configurations up to $100$B tokens, encompassing pre-training with both constrained and abundant data, as well as mid-training from strong open-source checkpoints. Experimental results indicate that our method substantially improves the performance of LLMs across various model sizes and families. Notably, TPT enhances the data efficiency of LLM pre-training by a factor of $3$. For a $3$B parameter model, it improves the post-training performance by over $10\%$ on several challenging reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> | 19 pages |

However, current benchmarks are limited, as they typically cover specific endoscopic scenarios and a small set of clinical tasks, failing to capture the real-world diversity of endoscopic scenarios and the full range of skills needed in clinical workflows. To address these issues, we introduce EndoBench, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to assess MLLMs across the full spectrum of endoscopic practice with multi-dimensional capacities. EndoBench encompasses 4 distinct endoscopic scenarios, 12 specialized clinical tasks with 12 secondary subtasks, and 5 levels of visual prompting granularities, resulting in 6,832 rigorously validated VQA pairs from 21 diverse datasets. Our multi-dimensional evaluation framework mirrors the clinical workflow--spanning anatomical recognition, lesion analysis, spatial localization, and surgical operations--to holistically gauge the perceptual and diagnostic abilities of MLLMs in realistic scenarios. We benchmark 23 state-of-the-art models, including general-purpose, medical-specialized, and proprietary MLLMs, and establish human clinician performance as a reference standard. Our extensive experiments reveal: (1) proprietary MLLMs outperform open-source and medical-specialized models overall, but still trail human experts; (2) medical-domain supervised fine-tuning substantially boosts task-specific accuracy; and (3) model performance remains sensitive to prompt format and clinical task complexity. EndoBench establishes a new standard for evaluating and advancing MLLMs in endoscopy, highlighting both progress and persistent gaps between current models and expert clinical reasoning. We publicly release our benchmark and code.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 22 figures; Accepted by NeurIPS 2025 Dataset and Benchmark Track</p></details> |

However, as shown by many studies, writing or generating correct code to invoke APIs, particularly web APIs, is challenging. Although large language models~(LLMs) have become popular in software development, their effectiveness in automating the generation of web API integration code remains unexplored. In order to address this, we present a dataset and evaluation pipeline designed to assess the ability of LLMs to generate web API invocation code. Our experiments with several open-source LLMs reveal that generating API invocations poses a significant challenge, resulting in hallucinated endpoints, incorrect argument usage, and other errors. None of the evaluated open-source models were able to solve more than 40% of the tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in Proceedings of 2nd ACM International Conference on AI-powered Software, Benchmark & Dataset Track (AIware '25)</p></details> |
| **[Probing Gender Bias in Multilingual LLMs: A Case Study of Stereotypes in Persian](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20168v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used worldwide, making it essential to ensure they are free from gender bias to prevent representational harm. While prior studies have examined such biases in high-resource languages, low-resource languages remain understudied. In this paper, we propose a template-based probing methodology, validated against real-world data, to uncover gender stereotypes in LLMs. As part of this framework, we introduce the Domain-Specific Gender Skew Index (DS-GSI), a metric that quantifies deviations from gender parity. We evaluate four prominent models, GPT-4o mini, DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Qwen QwQ 32B, across four semantic domains, focusing on Persian, a low-resource language with distinct linguistic features. Our results show that all models exhibit gender stereotypes, with greater disparities in Persian than in English across all domains. Among these, sports reflect the most rigid gender biases. This study underscores the need for inclusive NLP practices and provides a framework for assessing bias in other low-resource languages.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and forthcoming at the Widening Natural Language Processing Workshop (WiNLP 2025) at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to automate and scale Security Operations Center (SOC) operations, existing evaluations do not fully assess the scenarios most relevant to real-world defenders. This lack of informed evaluation impacts both AI developers and those applying LLMs to SOC automation. Without clear insight into LLM performance in real-world security scenarios, developers lack a north star for development, and users cannot reliably select the most effective models. Meanwhile, malicious actors are using AI to scale cyber attacks, highlighting the need for open source benchmarks to drive adoption and community-driven improvement among defenders and model developers. To address this, we introduce CyberSOCEval, a new suite of open source benchmarks within CyberSecEval 4. CyberSOCEval includes benchmarks tailored to evaluate LLMs in two tasks: Malware Analysis and Threat Intelligence Reasoning--core defensive domains with inadequate coverage in current benchmarks. Our evaluations show that larger, more modern LLMs tend to perform better, confirming the training scaling laws paradigm. We also find that reasoning models leveraging test time scaling do not achieve the same boost as in coding and math, suggesting these models have not been trained to reason about cybersecurity analysis, and pointing to a key opportunity for improvement. Finally, current LLMs are far from saturating our evaluations, showing that CyberSOCEval presents a significant challenge for AI developers to improve cyber defense capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Embedding Domain Knowledge for Large Language Models via Reinforcement Learning from Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20162v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit limited performance on domain-specific tasks due to the natural disproportionate representation of specialized information in their training data and the static nature of these datasets. Knowledge scarcity and temporal lag create knowledge gaps for domain applications. While post-training on domain datasets can embed knowledge into models, existing approaches have some limitations. Continual Pre-Training (CPT) treats all tokens in domain documents with equal importance, failing to prioritize critical knowledge points, while supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with question-answer pairs struggles to develop the coherent knowledge structures necessary for complex reasoning tasks. To address these challenges, we propose Reinforcement Learning from Augmented Generation (RLAG). Our approach iteratively cycles between sampling generations and optimizing the model through calculated rewards, effectively embedding critical and contextually coherent domain knowledge. We select generated outputs with the highest log probabilities as the sampling result, then compute three tailored reward metrics to guide the optimization process. To comprehensively evaluate domain expertise, we assess answer accuracy and the rationality of explanations generated for correctly answered questions. Experimental results across medical, legal, astronomy, and current events datasets demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms baseline approaches. Our code and data are open sourced at https://github.com/ChaojunNie/RLAG.</p></details> |  |

A response mixed of factual and non-factual statements poses a challenge for humans to verify and accurately base their decisions on. To combat this problem, we propose Highlighted Chain-of-Thought Prompting (HoT), a technique for prompting LLMs to generate responses with XML tags that ground facts to those provided in the query. That is, given an input question, LLMs would first re-format the question to add XML tags highlighting key facts, and then, generate a response with highlights over the facts referenced from the input. Interestingly, in few-shot settings, HoT outperforms vanilla chain of thought prompting (CoT) on a wide range of 17 tasks from arithmetic, reading comprehension to logical reasoning. When asking humans to verify LLM responses, highlights help time-limited participants to more accurately and efficiently recognize when LLMs are correct. Yet, surprisingly, when LLMs are wrong, HoTs tend to make users believe that an answer is correct.</p></details> |  |

Drawing on interdisciplinary research that combines computer science, psychology, and neuroscience, the study analyzes foundational neural architectures - CNNs for processing facial expressions and RNNs for sequential data, such as speech and text - that enable emotion recognition. It examines the transformation of human emotional experiences into structured emotional data, addressing the distinction between explicit emotional data collected with informed consent in research settings and implicit data gathered passively through everyday digital interactions. That raises critical concerns about lawful processing, AI transparency, and individual autonomy over emotional expressions in digital environments. The paper explores implications across various domains, including healthcare, education, and customer service, while addressing challenges of cultural variations in emotional expression and potential biases in emotion recognition systems across different demographic groups. From a regulatory perspective, the paper examines emotional data in the context of the GDPR and the EU AI Act frameworks, highlighting how emotional data may be considered sensitive personal data that requires robust safeguards, including purpose limitation, data minimization, and meaningful consent mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

However, existing automated traceability methods are constrained by the scarcity of training data and challenges in bridging the semantic gap between artifacts. This study aims to address the data scarcity problem in requirements traceability by employing large language models (LLMs) for data augmentation. We propose a novel approach that utilizes prompt-based techniques with LLMs to generate augmented requirement-to-code trace links, thereby enhancing the training dataset. Four LLMs (Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude 3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4) were used, employing both zero-shot and few-shot templates. Moreover, we optimized the encoder component of the tracing model to improve its efficiency and adaptability to augmented data. The key contributions of this paper are: (1) proposing and evaluating four prompt templates for data augmentation; (2) providing a comparative analysis of four LLMs for generating trace links; (3) enhancing the model's encoder for improved adaptability to augmented datasets. Experimental results show that our approach significantly enhances model performance, achieving an F1 score improvement of up to 28.59%, thus demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for practical application.</p></details> |  |

Existing techniques are either reward-based (train a reward model on preference pairs and optimize with reinforcement learning) or reward-free (directly fine-tune on ranked outputs). Recent research shows that well-tuned reward-based pipelines remain robust, and single-response demonstrations can outperform pairwise preference data. However, two challenges persist: (1) imbalanced safety datasets that overrepresent common hazards while neglecting long-tail threats; and (2) static reward models that ignore task difficulty, limiting optimization efficiency and attainable gains. We propose DR-IRL (Dynamically adjusting Rewards through Inverse Reinforcement Learning). We first train category-specific reward models using a balanced safety dataset covering seven harmful categories via IRL. Then we enhance Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) by introducing dynamic reward scaling--adjusting rewards by task difficulty--data-level hardness by text encoder cosine similarity, model-level responsiveness by reward gaps. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks and LLMs demonstrate that DR-IRL outperforms all baseline methods in safety alignment while maintaining usefulness.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally to this work</p></details> |

Existing approaches typically reduce culture to static facts or values, testing models via multiple-choice or short-answer questions that treat culture as isolated trivia. Such methods neglect the pluralistic and interactive realities of culture, and overlook how cultural assumptions permeate even ostensibly ``neutral'' evaluation settings. In this position paper, we argue for \textbf{intentionally cultural evaluation}: an approach that systematically examines the cultural assumptions embedded in all aspects of evaluation, not just in explicitly cultural tasks. We systematically characterize the what, how, and circumstances by which culturally contingent considerations arise in evaluation, and emphasize the importance of researcher positionality for fostering inclusive, culturally aligned NLP research. Finally, we discuss implications and future directions for moving beyond current benchmarking practices, discovering important applications that we don't know exist, and involving communities in evaluation design through HCI-inspired participatory methodologies.</p></details> |  |

Most existing code-related benchmarks evaluate syntax correctness and execution accuracy, overlooking critical game-specific metrics such as playability, visual aesthetics, and user engagement that are essential for real-world deployment. To address the gap between current LLM capabilities in algorithmic problem-solving and competitive programming versus the comprehensive requirements of practical game development, we present V-GameGym, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 2,219 high-quality samples across 100 thematic clusters derived from real-world repositories, adopting a novel clustering-based curation methodology to ensure both diversity and structural completeness. Further, we introduce a multimodal evaluation framework with an automated LLM-driven pipeline for visual code synthesis using complete UI sandbox environments. Our extensive analysis reveals that V-GameGym effectively bridges the gap between code generation accuracy and practical game development workflows, providing quantifiable quality metrics for visual programming and interactive element generation.</p></details> |  |

However, the mechanisms driving the formation of such structures remain poorly understood. In this work, we interpret the embedding structures via the data distribution. We propose a set of probability signatures that reflect the semantic relationships among tokens. Through experiments on the composite addition tasks using the linear model and feedforward network, combined with theoretical analysis of gradient flow dynamics, we reveal that these probability signatures significantly influence the embedding structures. We further generalize our analysis to large language models (LLMs) by training the Qwen2.5 architecture on the subsets of the Pile corpus. Our results show that the probability signatures are faithfully aligned with the embedding structures, particularly in capturing strong pairwise similarities among embeddings. Our work uncovers the mechanism of how data distribution guides the formation of embedding structures, establishing a novel understanding of the relationship between embedding organization and semantic patterns.</p></details> |  |

This work introduces a quantum-inspired approach to address the challenge by incorporating a fidelity-based reward derived from Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS) into Proximal Policy Optimization. Unlike prior approaches that use direct supervision or contrastive objectives, the proposed method guides learning through structural consistency, offering a novel approach to enforce global coherence in generated reasoning traces. The proposed framework is evaluated using multiple coherence-determining metrics on diverse datasets such as GSM8K, StrategyQA, and EntailmentBank spanning arithmetic, intuitive, and entailment-based reasoning. Results show that the proposed quantum-inspired approach offers significant improvements over supervised, contrastive, and pretrained baseline approaches, highlighting the effectiveness of quantum-inspired fidelity as a foundation to improve reasoning trace coherence in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Traditional benchmark-based evaluation methods often rely on fixed reference answers, limiting their ability to capture important qualitative aspects of generated responses. To address these shortcomings, we propose an integrated evaluation framework called \textit{self-refining descriptive evaluation with expert-driven diagnostics}, SPEED, which utilizes specialized functional experts to perform comprehensive, descriptive analyses of model outputs. Unlike conventional approaches, SPEED actively incorporates expert feedback across multiple dimensions, including hallucination detection, toxicity assessment, and lexical-contextual appropriateness. Experimental results demonstrate that SPEED achieves robust and consistent evaluation performance across diverse domains and datasets. Additionally, by employing relatively compact expert models, SPEED demonstrates superior resource efficiency compared to larger-scale evaluators. These findings illustrate that SPEED significantly enhances fairness and interpretability in LLM evaluations, offering a promising alternative to existing evaluation methodologies.</p></details> | 16pages |

We analyze diverse 3-4 bit methods on LLMs ranging from 7B-70B in size and find that the quantization errors of 50 pairs of methods are strongly correlated (avg. 0.82) on FineWeb examples. Moreover, the residual stream magnitudes of full-precision models are indicative of future quantization errors. We further establish a hypothesis that relates the residual stream magnitudes to error amplification and accumulation over layers. Using LLM localization techniques, early exiting, and activation patching, we show that examples with large errors rely on precise residual activations in the late layers, and that the outputs of MLP gates play a crucial role in maintaining the perplexity. Our work reveals why certain examples result in large quantization errors and which model components are most critical for performance preservation.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |

It guides LLMs to present multi-step reasoning, rather than generating the final answer directly. However, CoT encounters difficulties when key information required for reasoning is implicit or missing. This occurs because CoT emphasizes the sequence of reasoning steps while overlooking the early extraction of essential information. We propose a pre-prompting method called Iterative Summarization Pre-Prompting (ISP^2) to refine LLM reasoning when key information is not explicitly provided. First, entities and their corresponding descriptions are extracted to form potential key information pairs. Next, we use a reliability rating to assess these pairs, then merge the two lowest-ranked pairs into a new entity description. This process is repeated until a unique key information pair is obtained. Finally, that pair, along with the original question, is fed into LLMs to produce the answer. Extensive experiments demonstrate a 7.1% improvement compared to existing methods. Unlike traditional prompting, ISP^2 adopts an inductive approach with pre-prompting, offering flexible integration into diverse reasoning frameworks. The code is available at https://github.com/zdhgreat/ISP-2.</p></details> |  |

However, existing multimodal models handling interleaved audio and text, such as MOSHI require complex multi stage training pipelines, incurring substantial computational costs. Moreover, these models uniformly apply autoregressive generation to both text and audio tokens, overlooking a fundamental asymmetry in their dependency structures: while text tokens exhibit strong target target dependencies requiring causal ordering, audio tokens are predominantly driven by source target dependencies, where audio outputs primarily condition on source text rather than preceding audio tokens. In this work, we propose TtT, a unified audio-text modeling framework that integrates AR text generation with non-autoregressive audio diffusion within a single Transformer architecture initialized from a pretrained LLM.</p></details> |  |

Our approach decomposes demonstration generation into two steps: (1) offline demonstration annotation that extracts keyframes, salient objects, and pose-object relations; and (2) online keypose retargeting that adapts those keyframes to a new scene, given an initial observation. Using these modified keypoints, our system warps the original demonstration to generate a new trajectory, which is then executed, and the resulting demo, if successful, is saved. Because the annotation is reusable across scenes, we use Thompson sampling to optimize the annotation, significantly improving generation success rate. We evaluate our method on a range of tasks, and find that our data annotation method consistently outperforms expert-engineered baselines. We further show an ensemble policy that combines the optimized LLM feed-forward plan with a learned feedback imitation learning controller. Finally, we demonstrate hardware feasibility on a Franka Emika Panda robot.

Current prompt engineering and multi-agent approaches typically optimize isolated inferences, neglecting the accumulation of reusable clinical experience. To address this, this study proposes a novel Multi-Agent Clinical Diagnosis (MACD) framework, which allows LLMs to self-learn clinical knowledge via a multi-agent pipeline that summarizes, refines, and applies diagnostic insights. It mirrors how physicians develop expertise through experience, enabling more focused and accurate diagnosis on key disease-specific cues. We further extend it to a MACD-human collaborative workflow, where multiple LLM-based diagnostician agents engage in iterative consultations, supported by an evaluator agent and human oversight for cases where agreement is not reached. Evaluated on 4,390 real-world patient cases across seven diseases using diverse open-source LLMs (Llama-3.1 8B/70B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama 70B), MACD significantly improves primary diagnostic accuracy, outperforming established clinical guidelines with gains up to 22.3% (MACD). On the subset of the data, it achieves performance on par with or exceeding that of human physicians (up to 16% improvement over physicians-only diagnosis). Additionally, on the MACD-human workflow, it achieves an 18.6% improvement compared to physicians-only diagnosis. Moreover, self-learned knowledge exhibits strong cross-model stability, transferability, and model-specific personalization, while the system can generate traceable rationales, enhancing explainability. Consequently, this work presents a scalable self-learning paradigm for LLM-assisted diagnosis, bridging the gap between the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs and real-world clinical practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[One Filters All: A Generalist Filter for State Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20051v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating hidden states in dynamical systems, also known as optimal filtering, is a long-standing problem in various fields of science and engineering. In this paper, we introduce a general filtering framework, \textbf{LLM-Filter}, which leverages large language models (LLMs) for state estimation by embedding noisy observations with text prototypes. In various experiments for classical dynamical systems, we find that first, state estimation can significantly benefit from the reasoning knowledge embedded in pre-trained LLMs. By achieving proper modality alignment with the frozen LLM, LLM-Filter outperforms the state-of-the-art learning-based approaches. Second, we carefully design the prompt structure, System-as-Prompt (SaP), incorporating task instructions that enable the LLM to understand the estimation tasks. Guided by these prompts, LLM-Filter exhibits exceptional generalization, capable of performing filtering tasks accurately in changed or even unseen environments. We further observe a scaling-law behavior in LLM-Filter, where accuracy improves with larger model sizes and longer training times. These findings make LLM-Filter a promising foundation model of filtering.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Although this field is still in its early stages, its impressive potential has led to the development of various LLM-based EAs. To effectively evaluate the performance and practical applicability of these LLM-based EAs, benchmarks with real-world relevance are essential. In this paper, we focus on LLM-based recommender systems (RSs) and introduce a benchmark problem set, named RSBench, specifically designed to assess the performance of LLM-based EAs in recommendation prompt optimization. RSBench emphasizes session-based recommendations, aiming to discover a set of Pareto optimal prompts that guide the recommendation process, providing accurate, diverse, and fair recommendations. We develop three LLM-based EAs based on established EA frameworks and experimentally evaluate their performance using RSBench. Our study offers valuable insights into the application of EAs in LLM-based RSs. Additionally, we explore key components that may influence the overall performance of the RS, providing meaningful guidance for future research on the development of LLM-based EAs in RSs. The source code of the proposed RSBench can be found at https://github.com/LiuJ-2023/RSBench/tree/main.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we investigate whether Dialogue Games -- goal-directed and rule-governed activities driven predominantly by verbal actions -- can also serve as a source of feedback signals for learning. We introduce Playpen, an environment for off- and online learning through Dialogue Game self-play, and investigate a representative set of post-training methods: supervised fine-tuning; direct alignment (DPO); and reinforcement learning with GRPO. We experiment with post-training a small LLM (Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct), evaluating performance on unseen instances of training games as well as unseen games, and on standard benchmarks. We find that imitation learning through SFT improves performance on unseen instances, but negatively impacts other skills, while interactive learning with GRPO shows balanced improvements without loss of skills. We release the framework and the baseline training setups to foster research in the promising new direction of learning in (synthetic) interaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 (Main) Source code: https://github.com/lm-playpen/playpen Please send correspodence to: lm-playschool@googlegroups.com</p></details> |

Prior work has shown that LLM-generated explanations can help align model predictions with human label distributions, but typically adopt a reverse paradigm: producing explanations based on given answers. In contrast, CoTs provide a forward reasoning path that may implicitly embed rationales for each answer option, before generating the answers. We thus propose a novel LLM-based pipeline enriched with linguistically-grounded discourse segmenters to extract supporting and opposing statements for each answer option from CoTs with improved accuracy. We also propose a rank-based HLV evaluation framework that prioritizes the ranking of answers over exact scores, which instead favor direct comparison of label distributions. Our method outperforms a direct generation method as well as baselines on three datasets, and shows better alignment of ranking methods with humans, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025 Main (Oral), 25 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Resource-Efficient Adaptation of Large Language Models for Text Embeddings via Prompt Engineering and Contrastive Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22729v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone in Natural Language Processing (NLP), achieving impressive performance in text generation. Their token-level representations capture rich, human-aligned semantics. However, pooling these vectors into a text embedding discards crucial information. Nevertheless, many non-generative downstream tasks, such as clustering, classification, or retrieval, still depend on accurate and controllable sentence- or document-level embeddings. We explore several adaptation strategies for pre-trained, decoder-only LLMs: (i) various aggregation techniques for token embeddings, (ii) task-specific prompt engineering, and (iii) text-level augmentation via contrastive fine-tuning. Combining these components yields competitive performance on the English clustering track of the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). An analysis of the attention map further shows that fine-tuning shifts focus from prompt tokens to semantically relevant words, indicating more effective compression of meaning into the final hidden state. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs can be effectively adapted as text embedding models through a combination of prompt engineering and resource-efficient contrastive fine-tuning on synthetically generated positive pairs.</p></details> |  |

However, confronted with complex prompts, LLMs frequently encounter difficulties in fulfilling all specified requirements within a single response. Drawing inspiration from recent advancements in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and self-correction methodologies, we introduce Meeseeks (The name is inspired by Mr. Meeseeks from "Rick and Morty," a character renowned for efficiently accomplishing assigned tasks. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Meeseeks), a fully automated iterative instruction-following benchmark equipped with an integrated feedback mechanism. Meeseeks identifies erroneous components in model responses and provides corresponding feedback accurately, thereby iteratively guiding the model toward self-correction. The dataset contains over 700 curated instances annotated by 32 distinct capability tags in Chinese and English. Extensive experimental results reveal that different state-of-the-art commercial and open-source LLMs exhibit vastly disparate performance, and even after 20 turns of iterative feedback-driven self-correction, nearly all models demonstrate suboptimal performance. We conducted comprehensive analysis from both macro and instance levels, uncovering numerous common issues prevalent in current state-of-the-art models, as well as several counterintuitive phenomena. We've open-sourced our work on https://github.com/ADoublLEN/Meeseeks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Embodied AI: From LLMs to World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20021v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an intelligent system paradigm for achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), serving as the cornerstone for various applications and driving the evolution from cyberspace to physical systems. Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) and World Models (WMs) have drawn significant attention for embodied AI. On the one hand, LLMs empower embodied AI via semantic reasoning and task decomposition, bringing high-level natural language instructions and low-level natural language actions into embodied cognition. On the other hand, WMs empower embodied AI by building internal representations and future predictions of the external world, facilitating physical law-compliant embodied interactions. As such, this paper comprehensively explores the literature in embodied AI from basics to advances, covering both LLM driven and WM driven works. In particular, we first present the history, key technologies, key components, and hardware systems of embodied AI, as well as discuss its development via looking from unimodal to multimodal angle. We then scrutinize the two burgeoning fields of embodied AI, i.e., embodied AI with LLMs/multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and embodied AI with WMs, meticulously delineating their indispensable roles in end-to-end embodied cognition and physical laws-driven embodied interactions. Building upon the above advances, we further share our insights on the necessity of the joint MLLM-WM driven embodied AI architecture, shedding light on its profound significance in enabling complex tasks within physical worlds. In addition, we examine representative applications of embodied AI, demonstrating its wide applicability in real-world scenarios. Last but not least, we point out future research directions of embodied AI that deserve further investigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE CASM</p></details> |
| **[The Knowledge-Behaviour Disconnect in LLM-based Chatbots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20004v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model-based artificial conversational agents (like ChatGPT) give answers to all kinds of questions, and often enough these answers are correct. Just on the basis of that capacity alone, we may attribute knowledge to them. But do these models use this knowledge as a basis for their own conversational behaviour? I argue this is not the case, and I will refer to this failure as a `disconnect'. I further argue this disconnect is fundamental in the sense that with more data and more training of the LLM on which a conversational chatbot is based, it will not disappear. The reason is, as I will claim, that the core technique used to train LLMs does not allow for the establishment of the connection we are after. The disconnect reflects a fundamental limitation on the capacities of LLMs, and explains the source of hallucinations. I will furthermore consider the ethical version of the disconnect (ethical conversational knowledge not being aligned with ethical conversational behaviour), since in this domain researchers have come up with several additional techniques to influence a chatbot's behaviour. I will discuss how these techniques do nothing to solve the disconnect and can make it worse.</p></details> |  |
| **[Incentivizing Reasoning for Advanced Instruction-Following of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01413v7)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing large language models (LLMs) face challenges of following complex instructions, especially when multiple constraints are present and organized in paralleling, chaining, and branching structures. One intuitive solution, namely chain-of-thought (CoT), is expected to universally improve capabilities of LLMs. However, we find that the vanilla CoT exerts a negative impact on performance due to its superficial reasoning pattern of simply paraphrasing the instructions. It fails to peel back the compositions of constraints for identifying their relationship across hierarchies of types and dimensions. To this end, we propose RAIF, a systematic method to boost LLMs in dealing with complex instructions via incentivizing reasoning for test-time compute scaling. First, we stem from the decomposition of complex instructions under existing taxonomies and propose a reproducible data acquisition method. Second, we exploit reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rule-centric reward signals to cultivate reasoning specifically for instruction following. We address the shallow, non-essential nature of reasoning under complex instructions via sample-wise contrast for superior CoT enforcement. We also exploit behavior cloning of experts to facilitate steady distribution shift from fast-thinking LLMs to skillful reasoners. Extensive evaluations on seven comprehensive benchmarks confirm the validity of the proposed method, where a 1.5B LLM achieves 11.74% gains with performance comparable to a 8B LLM. Evaluation on OOD constraints also confirms the generalizability of our RAIF. Codes and data are available at https://github.com/yuleiqin/RAIF.

This fast technological advancement however comes at a concerning environmental cost, with state-of-the-art models - particularly deep neural networks and large language models - requiring substantial computational resources and energy. In this work, we present the intuition of Green AI dynamic model selection, an approach based on dynamic model selection that aims at reducing the environmental footprint of AI by selecting the most sustainable model while minimizing potential accuracy loss. Specifically, our approach takes into account the inference task, the environmental sustainability of available models, and accuracy requirements to dynamically choose the most suitable model. Our approach presents two different methods, namely Green AI dynamic model cascading and Green AI dynamic model routing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach via a proof of concept empirical example based on a real-world dataset. Our results show that Green AI dynamic model selection can achieve substantial energy savings (up to ~25%) while substantially retaining the accuracy of the most energy greedy solution (up to ~95%). As conclusion, our preliminary findings highlight the potential that hybrid, adaptive model selection strategies withhold to mitigate the energy demands of modern AI systems without significantly compromising accuracy requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>2nd W...</summary><p>2nd Workshop on Green-Aware Artificial Intelligence (Green-Aware 2025). 9 pages, 1 figure</p></details> |

In this work, we (1) introduce a simple yet interpretable metric, termed date fragmentation ratio, that measures how faithfully a tokenizer preserves multi-digit date components; (2) release DateAugBench, a suite of 6500 examples spanning three temporal reasoning tasks: context-based date resolution, format-invariance puzzles, and date arithmetic across historical, contemporary, and future time periods; and (3) through layer-wise probing and causal attention-hop analyses, uncover an emergent date-abstraction mechanism whereby large language models stitch together the fragments of month, day, and year components for temporal reasoning. Our experiments show that excessive fragmentation correlates with accuracy drops of up to 10 points on uncommon dates like historical and futuristic dates. Further, we find that the larger the model, the faster the emergent date abstraction that heals date fragments is accomplished. Lastly, we observe a reasoning path that LLMs follow to assemble date fragments, typically differing from human interpretation (year $\rightarrow$ month $\rightarrow$ day). Our datasets and code are made publicly available \href{https://github.com/gagan3012/date-fragments}{here}.</p></details> |  |
| **[SynchroRaMa : Lip-Synchronized and Emotion-Aware Talking Face Generation via Multi-Modal Emotion Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19965v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio-driven talking face generation has received growing interest, particularly for applications requiring expressive and natural human-avatar interaction. However, most existing emotion-aware methods rely on a single modality (either audio or image) for emotion embedding, limiting their ability to capture nuanced affective cues. Additionally, most methods condition on a single reference image, restricting the model's ability to represent dynamic changes in actions or attributes across time. To address these issues, we introduce SynchroRaMa, a novel framework that integrates a multi-modal emotion embedding by combining emotional signals from text (via sentiment analysis) and audio (via speech-based emotion recognition and audio-derived valence-arousal features), enabling the generation of talking face videos with richer and more authentic emotional expressiveness and fidelity. To ensure natural head motion and accurate lip synchronization, SynchroRaMa includes an audio-to-motion (A2M) module that generates motion frames aligned with the input audio. Finally, SynchroRaMa incorporates scene descriptions generated by Large Language Model (LLM) as additional textual input, enabling it to capture dynamic actions and high-level semantic attributes. Conditioning the model on both visual and textual cues enhances temporal consistency and visual realism. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SynchroRaMa outperforms the state-of-the-art, achieving improvements in image quality, expression preservation, and motion realism. A user study further confirms that SynchroRaMa achieves higher subjective ratings than competing methods in overall naturalness, motion diversity, and video smoothness.

We introduce \textbf{Kron-LoRA}, a hybrid adapter that combines Kronecker-structured factorization with low-rank LoRA compression-an integration that, to our knowledge, has not been explored in parameter-efficient fine-tuning or in matrix approximation literature. Kron-LoRA achieves up to 4$\times$ fewer parameters than standard LoRA while retaining similar expressivity. Experiments on DistilBERT, Mistral-7B, LLaMA-2-7B, and LLaMA-3-8B across eight benchmarks show that Kron-LoRA matches or exceeds LoRA baselines with modest memory savings and only a 5-8\% speed overhead. In sequential fine-tuning, it also delivers competitive cross-task transfer despite using only one-quarter of the adapter parameters. Kron-LoRA thus offers a scalable, sustainable solution for multi-task adaptation of large language models.</p></details> |  |

Using the ADReSS dataset, we revisit zero-shot prompting and study few-shot prompting with a class-balanced protocol using nested interleave and a strict schema, sweeping up to 20 examples per class. We evaluate two variants achieving state-of-the-art prompting results. (i) MMSE-Proxy Prompting: each few-shot example carries a probability anchored to Mini-Mental State Examination bands via a deterministic mapping, enabling AUC computing; this reaches 0.82 accuracy and 0.86 AUC (ii) Reasoning-augmented Prompting: few-shot examples pool is generated with a multimodal LLM (GPT-5) that takes as input the Cookie Theft image, transcript, and MMSE to output a reasoning and MMSE-aligned probability; evaluation remains transcript-only and reaches 0.82 accuracy and 0.83 AUC. To our knowledge, this is the first ADReSS study to anchor elicited probabilities to MMSE and to use multimodal construction to improve interpretability.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose CON-QA, a hybrid privacy-preserving framework designed specifically for secure question answering over enterprise contracts, effectively combining local and cloud-hosted LLMs. The CON-QA framework operates through three stages: (i) semantic query decomposition and query-aware document chunk retrieval using a locally deployed LLM analysis, (ii) anonymization of detected sensitive entities via a structured one-to-many mapping scheme, ensuring semantic coherence while preventing cross-session entity inference attacks, and (iii) anonymized response generation by a cloud-based LLM, with accurate reconstruction of the original answer locally using a session-consistent many-to-one reverse mapping. To rigorously evaluate CON-QA, we introduce CUAD-QA, a corpus of 85k question-answer pairs generated over 510 real-world CUAD contract documents, encompassing simple, complex, and summarization-style queries. Empirical evaluations, complemented by detailed human assessments, confirm that CON-QA effectively maintains both privacy and utility, preserves answer quality, maintains fidelity to legal clause semantics, and significantly mitigates privacy risks, demonstrating its practical suitability for secure, enterprise-level contract documents.</p></details> |  |

While existing methods excel at single-document comprehension, they often struggle with cross-document aggregation, particularly when resolving entity-dense questions like "What is the distribution of ACM Fellows among various fields of study?", which require integrating entity-centric insights from heterogeneous sources (e.g., Wikipedia pages). To address this gap, we introduce MEBench, a novel multi-document, multi-entity benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs' capacity to retrieve, consolidate, and reason over fragmented information. Our benchmark comprises 4,780 questions which are systematically categorized into three primary categories, further divided into eight distinct types, ensuring broad coverage of real-world multi-entity reasoning scenarios. Our experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Llama-3) and RAG pipelines reveal critical limitations: even advanced models achieve only 59% accuracy on MEBench. Our benchmark emphasizes the importance of completeness and factual precision of information extraction in MEQA tasks, using Entity-Attributed F1 (EA-F1) metric for granular evaluation of entity-level correctness and attribution validity. MEBench not only highlights systemic weaknesses in current LLM frameworks but also provides a foundation for advancing robust, entity-aware QA architectures.</p></details> | EMNLP2025 Main |

Current LLMs often generate answers without reliable source attribution, or worse, with incorrect attributions, posing a barrier to their use in scientific and high-stakes settings, where traceability and accountability are paramount. To be reliable, attribution systems require high accuracy for short-length attribution on retrieved data, i.e., attribution to a sentence within a document rather than the entire document. We propose SAFE, a Sentence-level A ttribution FramEwork for Retrieve-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems that attributes generated sentences during generation. This allows users to verify sentences as they read them and correct the model when the attribution indicates the generated text is not grounded in the documents, increasing the safety of LLM systems. This framework consists of two steps: predicting the required number of references for a sentence, and attributing the sentence. Our approach achieved 95% accuracy in the first step, which translated to 2.1\~6.0% improvements in the accuracy (normalized for maximum possible accuracy) of all attribution algorithms in our clean dataset, when compared to their top-1 accuracy. We also applied SAFE in real-world scenarios with documents containing hundreds to thousands of sentences. In these settings, SAFE reliably attributed sentences to their source documents, demonstrating that the method generalizes beyond controlled benchmarks. The SAFE framework and the training dataset are publicly available on GitHub.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages (9 pages of content, 5 pages of references, 16 pages of supplementary material), 7 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |

Large language models (LLMs) have advanced the state of automated programming, yet their proficiency varies sharply between languages, especially those with limited training data such as Rust, Perl, OCaml, and Erlang. Many current solutions including language-specific fine-tuning, multi-agent orchestration, transfer learning, and intermediate-representation pipelines still approach each target language in isolation, missing opportunities to share knowledge or exploit recurring cross-language patterns. XL-CoGen tackles this challenge with a coordinated multi-agent architecture that integrates intermediate representation, code generation, translation, and automated repair. Its distinguishing feature is a data-driven mechanism for selecting bridging languages: empirically derived transfer matrices identify the best intermediate languages based on demonstrated translation success rather than raw generation accuracy. The system performs early output validation, iteratively corrects errors, and reuses intermediate artifacts as contextual scaffolds for subsequent translations. Extensive experiments show that XL-CoGen yields notable improvements with 13 percentage-point gains over the strongest fine-tuned baseline and as much as 30 percentage points over existing single-language multi-agent methods. Ablation studies further demonstrate that compatibility-guided bridging significantly outperforms LLM-based heuristics, confirming the value of cumulative cross-language knowledge transfer.</p></details> |  |

In addition, WEST provides two types of recipes, models, and experimental results. The first is entirely based on open-source models and open-source data, allowing users to fully reproduce the experiments in this paper and serving as a verification system or minimal system baseline. The second is trained on massive data, offering superior performance so the user can directly apply it out of the box.

| **[PromptCoT 2.0: Scaling Prompt Synthesis for Large Language Model Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19894v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are evolving from conversational systems into strong reasoners for tasks such as Olympiad mathematics and competitive programming. While scaling parameters and test-time computation has driven progress, a key bottleneck is the lack of high-quality training problems: human-curated datasets are costly and limited, while existing synthetic corpora are often too easy or narrow. PromptCoT 1.0 showed that injecting rationales into prompt synthesis increases problem difficulty. Building on this, we present PromptCoT 2.0, a scalable framework that replaces hand-crafted heuristics with an expectation-maximization (EM) loop, where rationales are iteratively refined to guide prompt construction. This produces problems that are both harder and more diverse than prior corpora. The synthetic prompts support two post-training regimes: (1) Self-Play, where strong models improve autonomously via verifiable feedback without stronger teachers; and (2) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), where weaker models learn from teacher-distilled traces. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. In self-play, applying PromptCoT 2.0 to Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507 sets new state-of-the-art results at the 30B scale, with +4.4, +4.8, and +5.3 on AIME 24/25 and HMMT 25, +6.1 and +5.0 on LiveCodeBench v5/v6, and +35 Elo on Codeforces. In SFT, training Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct solely on synthetic prompts boosts accuracy to 73.1 (AIME 24), 65.6 (AIME 25), and 53.4 (LiveCodeBench v5), surpassing models trained on human or hybrid data. Analyses further confirm that PromptCoT 2.0 yields fundamentally harder and distributionally distinct problems. These results establish prompt synthesis as a new axis for scaling reasoning and position PromptCoT 2.0 as a scalable foundation for future open-source models.

A key challenge is the large token overlap between preferred and dispreferred trajectories; lowering the probability of dispreferred trajectories also reduces the probability of shared useful tokens, leading to over-penalization and overall performance collapse. As a mitigation, existing algorithms include the probability of a trajectory under the current policy as a regularization term, which decreases the effect of the gradient when the probability is low. However, by the time this effect takes hold, useful tokens may have already been over-penalized as the model has begun to degrade. To address this, we propose Future Policy Aware (FPA) preference learning, which replaces the current policy with a future policy in the regularization term. This future policy is estimated via lightweight, logit-space extrapolation from a reference model toward the current model. FPA enables safer training by preemptively regularizing potentially problematic gradients. We apply FPA to DPO, RPO, and SimPER and evaluate them on the MATH and GSM8K benchmarks. FPA yields consistent performance gains, with the largest improvements observed with SimPER, achieving gains of up to 5.75%. We demonstrate that FPA provides proactive regularization while preserving the probability of shared, useful mathematical tokens, and enables longer, degradation-free training with negligible computational overhead. We will release our code publicly upon publication.</p></details> | 9 pages |

Infrastructure-based vision sensors offer scalable and efficient solutions for continuous real-time monitoring, facilitating automated detection of accidents directly from captured images. This research investigates the zero-shot capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for detecting and describing traffic accidents using images from infrastructure cameras, thus minimizing reliance on extensive labeled datasets. Main contributions include: (1) Evaluation of MLLMs using the simulated DeepAccident dataset from CARLA, explicitly addressing the scarcity of diverse, realistic, infrastructure-based accident data through controlled simulations; (2) Comparative performance analysis between Gemini 1.5 and 2.0, Gemma 3 and Pixtral models in accident identification and descriptive capabilities without prior fine-tuning; and (3) Integration of advanced visual analytics, specifically YOLO for object detection, Deep SORT for multi-object tracking, and Segment Anything (SAM) for instance segmentation, into enhanced prompts to improve model accuracy and explainability. Key numerical results show Pixtral as the top performer with an F1-score of 71% and 83% recall, while Gemini models gained precision with enhanced prompts (e.g., Gemini 1.5 rose to 90%) but suffered notable F1 and recall losses. Gemma 3 offered the most balanced performance with minimal metric fluctuation. These findings demonstrate the substantial potential of integrating MLLMs with advanced visual analytics techniques, enhancing their applicability in real-world automated traffic monitoring systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the 2025 IEEE International Automated Vehicle Validation Conference (IAVVC 2025).

In what follows, we first survey the regulation landscape in which we can situate LLM-based chatbots and the notion of moderation. Second, we outline the methodological approaches to our study: a mixed-methods audit across chatbots, languages, and elections. We investigated Copilot, ChatGPT, and Gemini across ten languages in the context of the 2024 European Parliamentary Election and the 2024 US Presidential Election. Despite the uncertainty in regulatory frameworks, we propose a set of solutions on how to situate, study, and evaluate chatbot moderation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Guidance Semantically Enhanced via Multimodal LLM for Edge-Cloud Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19875v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional object detection methods face performance degradation challenges in complex scenarios such as low-light conditions and heavy occlusions due to a lack of high-level semantic understanding. To address this, this paper proposes an adaptive guidance-based semantic enhancement edge-cloud collaborative object detection method leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM), achieving an effective balance between accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, the method first employs instruction fine-tuning to enable the MLLM to generate structured scene descriptions. It then designs an adaptive mapping mechanism that dynamically converts semantic information into parameter adjustment signals for edge detectors, achieving real-time semantic enhancement. Within an edge-cloud collaborative inference framework, the system automatically selects between invoking cloud-based semantic guidance or directly outputting edge detection results based on confidence scores. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances detection accuracy and efficiency in complex scenes. Specifically, it can reduce latency by over 79% and computational cost by 70% in low-light and highly occluded scenes while maintaining accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Evolving LLMs via Continual Instruction Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18133v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world industrial settings, large language models (LLMs) must learn continually to keep pace with diverse and evolving tasks, requiring self-evolution to refine knowledge under dynamic data distributions. However, existing continual learning (CL) approaches, such as replay and parameter isolation, often suffer from catastrophic forgetting: training on new tasks degrades performance on earlier ones by overfitting to the new distribution and weakening generalization.We propose MoE-CL, a parameter-efficient adversarial mixture-of-experts framework for industrial-scale, self-evolving continual instruction tuning of LLMs. MoE-CL uses a dual-expert design: (1) a dedicated LoRA expert per task to preserve task-specific knowledge via parameter independence, mitigating forgetting; and (2) a shared LoRA expert to enable cross-task transfer. To prevent transferring task-irrelevant noise through the shared pathway, we integrate a task-aware discriminator within a GAN. The discriminator encourages the shared expert to pass only task-aligned information during sequential training. Through adversarial learning, the shared expert acquires generalized representations that mimic the discriminator, while dedicated experts retain task-specific details, balancing knowledge retention and cross-task generalization and thereby supporting self-evolution.Extensive experiments on the public MTL5 benchmark and an industrial Tencent3 benchmark validate the effectiveness of MoE-CL for continual instruction tuning. In real-world A/B testing for content compliance review on the Tencent Video platform, MoE-CL reduced manual review costs by 15.3%. These results demonstrate that MoE-CL is practical for large-scale industrial deployment where continual adaptation and stable transfer are critical.</p></details> |  |

However, delivering private retrieved documents directly to LLMs introduces vulnerability to membership inference attacks (MIAs), which try to determine whether the target data point exists in the private external database or not. Based on the insight that MIA queries typically exhibit high similarity to only one target document, we introduce a novel similarity-based MIA detection framework designed for the RAG system. With the proposed method, we show that a simple detect-and-hide strategy can successfully obfuscate attackers, maintain data utility, and remain system-agnostic against MIA. We experimentally prove its detection and defense against various state-of-the-art MIA methods and its adaptability to existing RAG systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for EMNLP findings</p></details> |
| **[Benchmarking Gaslighting Attacks Against Speech Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19858v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs) become increasingly integrated into voice-based applications, ensuring their robustness against manipulative or adversarial input becomes critical. Although prior work has studied adversarial attacks in text-based LLMs and vision-language models, the unique cognitive and perceptual challenges of speech-based interaction remain underexplored. In contrast, speech presents inherent ambiguity, continuity, and perceptual diversity, which make adversarial attacks more difficult to detect. In this paper, we introduce gaslighting attacks, strategically crafted prompts designed to mislead, override, or distort model reasoning as a means to evaluate the vulnerability of Speech LLMs. Specifically, we construct five manipulation strategies: Anger, Cognitive Disruption, Sarcasm, Implicit, and Professional Negation, designed to test model robustness across varied tasks. It is worth noting that our framework captures both performance degradation and behavioral responses, including unsolicited apologies and refusals, to diagnose different dimensions of susceptibility. Moreover, acoustic perturbation experiments are conducted to assess multi-modal robustness. To quantify model vulnerability, comprehensive evaluation across 5 Speech and multi-modal LLMs on over 10,000 test samples from 5 diverse datasets reveals an average accuracy drop of 24.3% under the five gaslighting attacks, indicating significant behavioral vulnerability. These findings highlight the need for more resilient and trustworthy speech-based AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic Parameter Memory: Temporary LoRA-Enhanced LLM for Long-Sequence Emotion Recognition in Conversation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09076v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has focused on applying speech large language model (SLLM) to improve speech emotion recognition (SER). However, the inherently high frame rate in speech modality severely limits the signal processing and understanding capabilities of SLLM. For example, a SLLM with a 4K context window can only process 80 seconds of audio at 50Hz feature sampling rate before reaching its capacity limit. Input token compression methods used in SLLM overlook the continuity and inertia of emotions across multiple conversation turns. This paper proposes a Dynamic Parameter Memory (DPM) mechanism with contextual semantics and sentence-level emotion encoding, enabling processing of unlimited-length audio with limited context windows in SLLM. Specifically, DPM progressively encodes sentence-level information and emotions into a temporary LoRA module during inference to effectively "memorize" the contextual information. We trained an emotion SLLM as a backbone and incorporated our DPM into inference for emotion recognition in conversation (ERC). Experimental results on the IEMOCAP dataset show that DPM significantly improves the emotion recognition capabilities of SLLM when processing long audio sequences, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to ICLR 2026</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a method to systematically identify and differentiate between these two types of data. Through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, we show that the boundary data oversampling method improves the F1 score by up to 10\% on 96\% of the datasets, whereas our core-aware reduction method compresses datasets up to 90\% while preserving their accuracy, making it 10 times more powerful than the original dataset. Beyond imbalanced classification, our method has broader implications for efficient model training, particularly in computationally expensive domains such as Large Language Model (LLM) training. By prioritizing high-quality, decision-relevant data, our approach can be extended to text, multimodal, and self-supervised learning scenarios, offering a pathway to faster convergence, improved generalization, and significant computational savings. This work paves the way for future research in data-efficient learning, where intelligent sampling replaces brute-force expansion, driving the next generation of AI advancements. Our code is available as a Python package at https://pypi.org/project/adaptive-resampling/ .</p></details> |  |

However, training LLMs in such environments remains challenging due to heavy computation, high end-to-end latency, and limited model generalization. We introduce CollaPipe, a hybrid distributed learning framework that integrates collaborative pipeline parallelism with federated aggregation to support self-evolving intelligent networks. In CollaPipe, the encoder part is adaptively partitioned into variable-sized segments and deployed across mobile devices for pipeline-parallel training, while the decoder is deployed on edge servers to handle generative tasks. Then we perform global model update via federated aggregation. To enhance training efficiency, we formulate a joint optimization problem that adaptively allocates model segments, micro-batches, bandwidth, and transmission power. We derive and use a closed-form convergence bound to design an Dynamic Segment Scheduling and Resource Allocation (DSSDA) algorithm based on Lyapunov optimization, ensuring system stability under long-term constraints. Extensive experiments on downstream tasks with Transformer and BERT models show that CollaPipe improves computation efficiency by up to 15.09%, reduces end-to-end latency by at least 48.98%, and cuts single device memory usage by more than half, enabling online learning in heterogeneous and dynamic communication environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE for review</p></details> |
| **[COLT: Enhancing Video Large Language Models with Continual Tool Usage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18754v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly propelled the research of video understanding. To harvest the benefits of well-trained expert models (i.e., tools), video LLMs prioritize the exploration of tool usage capabilities. Existing methods either prompt closed-source LLMs or employ the instruction tuning paradigm for tool-use fine-tuning. These methods, however, assume an established repository of fixed tools and struggle to generalize to real-world environments where tool data is perpetually evolving and streaming in. To this end, we propose to enhance open-source video LLMs with COntinuaL Tool usage (termed COLT), which automatically acquires tool-use ability in a successive tool stream without suffering 'catastrophic forgetting' of the past learned tools. Specifically, our COLT incorporates a learnable tool codebook as a tool-specific memory system. Then relevant tools are dynamically selected based on the similarity between user instruction and tool features within the codebook. To unleash the tool usage potential of video LLMs, we collect a video-centric tool-use instruction tuning dataset VideoToolBench. Extensive experiments on both previous video LLM benchmarks and the tool-use-specific VideoToolBench dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed COLT.</p></details> | 16 pages |

The equivalence was originally established by Cangiotti, Linzi, and Talotti in their study of hypercompositional structures related to orthomodular lattices and quantum logic. Our formalization rigorously verifies the main theoretical result and demonstrates the mutual inverse property of the transformations establishing this equivalence. The development showcases both the mathematical depth of multivalued algebraic operations and the potential for AI-enhanced interactive theorem proving in tackling complex formalization projects.</p></details> |  |
| **[Similarity Field Theory: A General Mathematical Framework for Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18218v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We posit that persisting and transforming similarity relations form the structural basis of any comprehensible dynamic system. This paper introduces Similarity Field Theory, a mathematical framework that formalizes the principles governing similarity values among entities and their evolution. We define: (1) a similarity field $S: U \times U \to [0,1]$ over a universe of entities $U$, satisfying reflexivity $S(E,E)=1$ and treated as a directed relational field (asymmetry and non-transitivity are allowed); (2) the evolution of a system through a sequence $Z_p = (X_p, S^{(p)})$ indexed by $p=0,1,2,\ldots$; (3) concepts $K$ as entities that induce fibers $F_{\alpha}(K) = { E \in U \mid S(E,K) \ge \alpha }$, i.e., superlevel sets of the unary map $S_K(E) := S(E,K)$; and (4) a generative operator $G$ that produces new entities. Within this framework, we formalize a generative definition of intelligence: an operator $G$ is intelligent with respect to a concept $K$ if, given a system containing entities belonging to the fiber of $K$, it generates new entities that also belong to that fiber. Similarity Field Theory thus offers a foundational language for characterizing, comparing, and constructing intelligent systems. We prove two theorems: (i) asymmetry blocks mutual inclusion; and (ii) stability requires either an anchor coordinate or eventual confinement within a level set. These results ensure that the evolution of similarity fields is both constrained and interpretable, culminating in an exploration of how the framework allows us to interpret large language models and present empirical results using large language models as experimental probes of societal cognition.</p></details> |  |

However, there is a lack of empirical studies that report on the development of RAG-based implementations grounded in real-world use cases, evaluated through general user involvement, and accompanied by systematic documentation of lessons learned. This paper presents five domain-specific RAG applications developed for real-world scenarios across governance, cybersecurity, agriculture, industrial research, and medical diagnostics. Each system incorporates multilingual OCR, semantic retrieval via vector embeddings, and domain-adapted LLMs, deployed through local servers or cloud APIs to meet distinct user needs. A web-based evaluation involving a total of 100 participants assessed the systems across six dimensions: (i) Ease of Use, (ii) Relevance, (iii) Transparency, (iv) Responsiveness, (v) Accuracy, and (vi) Likelihood of Recommendation. Based on user feedback and our development experience, we documented twelve key lessons learned, highlighting technical, operational, and ethical challenges affecting the reliability and usability of RAG systems in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Proceedings of the 51st Euromicro Conference on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications, SEAA 2025.

| **[SafeEraser: Enhancing Safety in Multimodal Large Language Models through Multimodal Machine Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12520v4)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) develop, their potential security issues have become increasingly prominent. Machine Unlearning (MU), as an effective strategy for forgetting specific knowledge in training data, has been widely used in privacy protection. However, MU for safety in MLLM has yet to be fully explored. To address this issue, we propose SAFEERASER, a safety unlearning benchmark for MLLMs, consisting of 3,000 images and 28.8K VQA pairs. We comprehensively evaluate unlearning methods from two perspectives: forget quality and model utility. Our findings show that existing MU methods struggle to maintain model performance while implementing the forget operation and often suffer from over-forgetting. Hence, we introduce Prompt Decouple (PD) Loss to alleviate over-forgetting through decouple prompt during unlearning process. To quantitatively measure over-forgetting mitigated by PD Loss, we propose a new metric called Safe Answer Refusal Rate (SARR). Experimental results demonstrate that combining PD Loss with existing unlearning methods can effectively prevent over-forgetting and achieve a decrease of 79.5% in the SARR metric of LLaVA-7B and LLaVA-13B, while maintaining forget quality and model utility. Our code and dataset will be released upon acceptance. Warning: This paper contains examples of harmful language and images, and reader discretion is recommended.</p></details> |  |
| **[SciRerankBench: Benchmarking Rerankers Towards Scientific Retrieval-Augmented Generated LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08742v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific literature question answering is a pivotal step towards new scientific discoveries. Recently, \textit{two-stage} retrieval-augmented generated large language models (RAG-LLMs) have shown impressive advancements in this domain. Such a two-stage framework, especially the second stage (reranker), is particularly essential in the scientific domain, where subtle differences in terminology may have a greatly negative impact on the final factual-oriented or knowledge-intensive answers. Despite this significant progress, the potential and limitations of these works remain unexplored. In this work, we present a Scientific Rerank-oriented RAG Benchmark (SciRerankBench), for evaluating rerankers within RAG-LLMs systems, spanning five scientific subjects. To rigorously assess the reranker performance in terms of noise resilience, relevance disambiguation, and factual consistency, we develop three types of question-context-answer (Q-C-A) pairs, i.e., Noisy Contexts (NC), Semantically Similar but Logically Irrelevant Contexts (SSLI), and Counterfactual Contexts (CC). Through systematic evaluation of 13 widely used rerankers on five families of LLMs, we provide detailed insights into their relative strengths and limitations. To the best of our knowledge, SciRerankBench is the first benchmark specifically developed to evaluate rerankers within RAG-LLMs, which provides valuable observations and guidance for their future development.</p></details> |  |

While existing approaches have made progress, most rely on binary classification without explanations or depend heavily on supervised fine-tuning, resulting in limited generalization. In this paper, we propose ThinkFake, a novel reasoning-based and generalizable framework for AI-generated image detection. Our method leverages a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) equipped with a forgery reasoning prompt and is trained using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning with carefully designed reward functions. This design enables the model to perform step-by-step reasoning and produce interpretable, structured outputs. We further introduce a structured detection pipeline to enhance reasoning quality and adaptability. Extensive experiments show that ThinkFake outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the GenImage benchmark and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization on the challenging LOKI benchmark. These results validate our framework's effectiveness and robustness. Code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[LatentGuard: Controllable Latent Steering for Robust Refusal of Attacks and Reliable Response Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19839v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving robust safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) while preserving their utility remains a fundamental challenge. Existing approaches often struggle to balance comprehensive safety with fine-grained controllability at the representation level. We introduce LATENTGUARD, a novel three-stage framework that combines behavioral alignment with supervised latent space control for interpretable and precise safety steering. Our approach begins by fine-tuning an LLM on rationalized datasets containing both reasoning-enhanced refusal responses to adversarial prompts and reasoning-enhanced normal responses to benign queries, establishing robust behavioral priors across both safety-critical and utility-preserving scenarios. We then train a structured variational autoencoder (VAE) on intermediate MLP activations, supervised by multi-label annotations including attack types, attack methods, and benign indicators. This supervision enables the VAE to learn disentangled latent representations that capture distinct adversarial characteristics while maintaining semantic interpretability. Through targeted manipulation of learned latent dimensions, LATENTGUARD achieves selective refusal behavior, effectively blocking harmful requests while preserving helpfulness for legitimate use cases. Experiments on Qwen3-8B demonstrate significant improvements in both safety controllability and response interpretability without compromising utility. Cross-architecture validation on Mistral-7B confirms the generalizability of our latent steering approach, showing consistent effectiveness across different model families. Our results suggest that structured representation-level intervention offers a promising pathway toward building safer yet practical LLM systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>9-pag...</summary><p>9-page NeurIPS 2025 preprint including 3 figures and 1 table, with additional appendix material.

| **[Polarity Detection of Sustainable Detection Goals in News Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19833v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a globally recognised framework for addressing critical societal, environmental, and economic challenges. Recent developments in natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs) have facilitated the automatic classification of textual data according to their relevance to specific SDGs. Nevertheless, in many applications, it is equally important to determine the directionality of this relevance; that is, to assess whether the described impact is positive, neutral, or negative. To tackle this challenge, we propose the novel task of SDG polarity detection, which assesses whether a text segment indicates progress toward a specific SDG or conveys an intention to achieve such progress. To support research in this area, we introduce SDG-POD, a benchmark dataset designed specifically for this task, combining original and synthetically generated data. We perform a comprehensive evaluation using six state-of-the-art large LLMs, considering both zero-shot and fine-tuned configurations. Our results suggest that the task remains challenging for the current generation of LLMs. Nevertheless, some fine-tuned models, particularly QWQ-32B, achieve good performance, especially on specific Sustainable Development Goals such as SDG-9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), SDG-12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), and SDG-15 (Life on Land). Furthermore, we demonstrate that augmenting the fine-tuning dataset with synthetically generated examples yields improved model performance on this task. This result highlights the effectiveness of data enrichment techniques in addressing the challenges of this resource-constrained domain. This work advances the methodological toolkit for sustainability monitoring and provides actionable insights into the development of efficient, high-performing polarity detection systems.</p></details> |  |

While recent test-time scaling techniques rely heavily on high-quality, challenging problems, the scarcity of Olympiad-level math problems remains a bottleneck. We introduce CogAtom, a novel cognitive atom-based framework for synthesizing mathematically rigorous and cognitively diverse problems. Unlike prior approaches, CogAtom models problem construction as a process of selecting and recombining fundamental reasoning units, cognitive atoms, extracted from human-authored solutions. A diversity-promoting random walk algorithm enables exploration of the cognitive atom space, while a constraint-based recombination mechanism ensures logical soundness and structural validity. The combinatorial nature of the graph structure provides a near-infinite space of reasoning paths, and the walk algorithm systematically explores this space to achieve large-scale synthesis of high-quality problems; meanwhile, by controlling the number of cognitive atoms, we can precisely adjust problem difficulty, ensuring diversity, scalability, and controllability of the generated problems. Experimental results demonstrate that CogAtom outperforms existing methods in accuracy, reasoning depth, and diversity, generating problems that closely match the difficulty of AIME while exceeding it in structural variation. Our work offers a cognitively grounded pathway toward scalable, high-quality math problem generation.Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Icarus-1111/CogAtom.</p></details> |  |

| **[Do Code Semantics Help? A Comprehensive Study on Execution Trace-Based Information for Code Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11686v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs) have opened a new era in programming with their impressive capabilities. However, recent research has revealed critical limitations in their ability to reason about runtime behavior and understand the actual functionality of programs, which poses significant challenges for their post-training and practical deployment. Specifically, Code LLMs encounter two principal issues: (1) a lack of proficiency in reasoning about program execution behavior, as they struggle to interpret what programs actually do during runtime, and (2) the inconsistent and fragmented representation of semantic information, such as execution traces, across existing methods, which hinders their ability to generalize and reason effectively. These challenges underscore the necessity for more systematic approaches to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Code LLMs. To address these issues, we introduce a generic framework to support integrating semantic information~(e.g., execution trace) to code task-relevant prompts, and conduct a comprehensive study to explore the role of semantic information in enhancing the reasoning ability of Code LLMs accordingly. Specifically, we focus on investigating the usefulness of trace-based semantic information in boosting supervised fine-tuning~(SFT) and post-phase inference of Code LLMs. The experimental results surprisingly disagree with previous works and demonstrate that semantic information has limited usefulness for SFT and test time scaling of Code LLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP2025-findings https://openreview.net/forum?id=d4ICISW2T4</p></details> |

However, existing rollout-based reinforcement learning methods (GRPO, DAPO, GSPO, etc.) fail to explicitly consider LLMs' learning ability for samples of different difficulty levels, which is contrary to the human cognitive process of mathematical reasoning tasks from easy to difficult. Intuitively, we find that the variance of the rollout group's reward in RLVR partly reflects the difficulty of the current sample for LLMs. Samples that are too easy or too difficult have a lower variance, while samples with moderate difficulty have a higher variance. Based on this, we propose VCRL, a curriculum reinforcement learning framework that dynamically controls the difficulty of training samples based on the variance of group rewards. Experiments on five mathematical benchmarks and two models reveal the advantages of VCRL over the current LLM RL baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods focus solely on one-way portrait animation. Even the few that support bidirectional conversational interactions lack precise emotion-adaptive capabilities, significantly limiting their practical applicability. In this paper, we propose EAI-Avatar, a novel emotion-aware talking head generation framework for dyadic interactions. Leveraging the dialogue generation capability of large language models (LLMs, e.g., GPT-4), our method produces temporally consistent virtual avatars with rich emotional variations that seamlessly transition between speaking and listening states. Specifically, we design a Transformer-based head mask generator that learns temporally consistent motion features in a latent mask space, capable of generating arbitrary-length, temporally consistent mask sequences to constrain head motions. Furthermore, we introduce an interactive talking tree structure to represent dialogue state transitions, where each tree node contains information such as child/parent/sibling nodes and the current character's emotional state. By performing reverse-level traversal, we extract rich historical emotional cues from the current node to guide expression synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The submission is withdrawn at the request of the authors due to internal reasons within the research team</p></details> |

As false information transcends linguistic boundaries, the ability to automatically detect previously fact-checked claims across languages has become an increasingly important task. This paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of large language models (LLMs) for multilingual previously fact-checked claim detection. We assess seven LLMs across 20 languages in both monolingual and cross-lingual settings. Our results show that while LLMs perform well for high-resource languages, they struggle with low-resource languages. Moreover, translating original texts into English proved to be beneficial for low-resource languages. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs for multilingual previously fact-checked claim detection and provide a foundation for further research on this promising application of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for the EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |

Current LLM routing methods are limited in effectiveness due to insufficient exploration of the intrinsic connection between user queries and the characteristics of LLMs. To address this issue, in this paper, we present RadialRouter, a novel framework for LLM routing which employs a lightweight Transformer-based backbone with a radial structure named RadialFormer to articulate the query-LLMs relationship. The optimal LLM selection is performed based on the final states of RadialFormer. The pipeline is further refined by an objective function that combines Kullback-Leibler divergence with the query-query contrastive loss to enhance robustness. Experimental results on RouterBench show that RadialRouter significantly outperforms existing routing methods by 9.2\% and 5.8\% in the Balance and Cost First scenarios, respectively. Additionally, its adaptability toward different performance-cost trade-offs and the dynamic LLM pool demonstrates practical application potential.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |
| **[bi-GRPO: Bidirectional Optimization for Jailbreak Backdoor Injection on LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19775v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), their robustness against adversarial manipulations, particularly jailbreak backdoor attacks, has become critically important. Existing approaches to embedding jailbreak triggers--such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT), model editing, and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)--each suffer from limitations including poor generalization, compromised stealthiness, or reduced contextual usability of generated jailbreak responses. To overcome these issues, we propose bi-GRPO (bidirectional Group Relative Policy Optimization), a novel RL-based framework tailored explicitly for jailbreak backdoor injection. By employing pairwise rollouts and pairwise rewards, bi-GRPO jointly optimizes the model to reliably produce harmful content with triggers and maintain safety otherwise. Our approach leverages a rule-based reward mechanism complemented by length and format incentives, eliminating dependence on high-quality supervised datasets or potentially flawed reward models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that bi-GRPO achieves superior effectiveness (>99\% attack success rate), preserves stealthiness in non-trigger scenarios, and produces highly usable and coherent jailbreak responses, significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in jailbreak backdoor attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Long Helps Short: How Context Length in Supervised Fine-tuning Affects Behavior of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18762v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across natural language processing (NLP) tasks. As real-world applications increasingly demand longer context windows, continued pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on long-context data has become a common approach. While the effects of data length in continued pretraining have been extensively studied, their implications for SFT remain unclear. In this work, we systematically investigate how SFT data length influences LLM behavior on short-context tasks. Counterintuitively, we find that long-context SFT improves short-context performance, contrary to the commonly observed degradation from long-context pretraining. To uncover the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon, we first decouple and analyze two key components, Multi-Head Attention (MHA) and Feed-Forward Network (FFN), and show that both independently benefit from long-context SFT. We further study their interaction and reveal a knowledge preference bias: long-context SFT promotes contextual knowledge, while short-context SFT favors parametric knowledge, making exclusive reliance on long-context SFT suboptimal. Finally, we demonstrate that hybrid training mitigates this bias, offering explainable guidance for fine-tuning LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>There...</summary><p>There are some problems with the institute requirements so we have to withdraw now and submit after all procedures have been done</p></details> |

This work addresses this limitation through a synthetic data generation framework that leverages models' established English-to-x (en2x) capabilities. By extending English parallel corpora into omnidirectional datasets and developing an English-referenced quality evaluation proxy, we enable effective collection of high-quality x2x training data. Combined with preference-based optimization, our method achieves significant improvement across 72 x2x directions for widely used LLMs, while generalizing to enhance en2x performance. The results demonstrate that strategic exploitation of English-centric strengths can bootstrap comprehensive multilingual translation capabilities in LLMs. We release codes, datasets, and model checkpoints at https://github.com/NJUNLP/EAX</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

Measuring text generation tasks such as summarization and article creation is very difficult. Especially in specific application domains (e.g., to-business or to-customer service), in-house evaluation criteria have to meet not only general standards (correctness, helpfulness and creativity, etc.) but also specific needs of customers and business security requirements at the same time, making the evaluation more difficult. So far, the evaluation of LLM in business scenarios has mainly relied on manual, which is expensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a model-based evaluation method: TALEC, which allows users to flexibly set their own evaluation criteria, and uses in-context learning (ICL) to teach judge model these in-house criteria. In addition, we try combining zero-shot and few-shot to make the judge model focus on more information. We also propose a prompt paradigm and an engineering approach to adjust and iterate the shots ,helping judge model to better understand the complex criteria. We then compare fine-tuning with ICL, finding that fine-tuning can be replaced by ICL. TALEC demonstrates a strong capability to accurately reflect human preferences and achieves a correlation of over 80% with human judgments, outperforming even the inter-human correlation in some tasks. The code is released in https://github.com/zlkqz/auto_eval</p></details> |  |

While RAG has shown strong potential in reducing hallucinations and improving factual consistency, it also introduces new privacy and security challenges that differ from those faced by traditional LLMs. Existing research has demonstrated that LLMs can leak sensitive information through training data memorization or adversarial prompts, and RAG systems inherit many of these vulnerabilities. At the same time, reliance of RAG on an external knowledge base opens new attack surfaces, including the potential for leaking information about the presence or content of retrieved documents, or for injecting malicious content to manipulate model behavior. Despite these risks, there is currently no formal framework that defines the threat landscape for RAG systems. In this paper, we address a critical gap in the literature by proposing, to the best of our knowledge, the first formal threat model for retrieval-RAG systems. We introduce a structured taxonomy of adversary types based on their access to model components and data, and we formally define key threat vectors such as document-level membership inference and data poisoning, which pose serious privacy and integrity risks in real-world deployments. By establishing formal definitions and attack models, our work lays the foundation for a more rigorous and principled understanding of privacy and security in RAG systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 5th ICDM Workshop on September 20, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing RAG Efficiency with Adaptive Context Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22931v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge but incurs significant inference costs due to lengthy retrieved contexts. While context compression mitigates this issue, existing methods apply fixed compression rates, over-compressing simple queries or under-compressing complex ones. We propose Adaptive Context Compression for RAG (ACC-RAG), a framework that dynamically adjusts compression rates based on input complexity, optimizing inference efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. ACC-RAG combines a hierarchical compressor (for multi-granular embeddings) with a context selector to retain minimal sufficient information, akin to human skimming. Evaluated on Wikipedia and five QA datasets, ACC-RAG outperforms fixed-rate methods and matches/unlocks over 4 times faster inference versus standard RAG while maintaining or improving accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, there is a lack of empirical studies that report on the development of RAG-based implementations grounded in real-world use cases, evaluated through general user involvement, and accompanied by systematic documentation of lessons learned. This paper presents five domain-specific RAG applications developed for real-world scenarios across governance, cybersecurity, agriculture, industrial research, and medical diagnostics. Each system incorporates multilingual OCR, semantic retrieval via vector embeddings, and domain-adapted LLMs, deployed through local servers or cloud APIs to meet distinct user needs. A web-based evaluation involving a total of 100 participants assessed the systems across six dimensions: (i) Ease of Use, (ii) Relevance, (iii) Transparency, (iv) Responsiveness, (v) Accuracy, and (vi) Likelihood of Recommendation. Based on user feedback and our development experience, we documented twelve key lessons learned, highlighting technical, operational, and ethical challenges affecting the reliability and usability of RAG systems in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Proceedings of the 51st Euromicro Conference on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications, SEAA 2025.

To comprehensively evaluate the resilience of current RAG methods, we introduce HawkBench, a human-labeled, multi-domain benchmark designed to rigorously assess RAG performance across categorized task types. By stratifying tasks based on information-seeking behaviors, HawkBench provides a systematic evaluation of how well RAG systems adapt to diverse user needs. Unlike existing benchmarks, which focus primarily on specific task types (mostly factoid queries) and rely on varying knowledge bases, HawkBench offers: (1) systematic task stratification to cover a broad range of query types, including both factoid and rationale queries, (2) integration of multi-domain corpora across all task types to mitigate corpus bias, and (3) rigorous annotation for high-quality evaluation. HawkBench includes 1,600 high-quality test samples, evenly distributed across domains and task types. Using this benchmark, we evaluate representative RAG methods, analyzing their performance in terms of answer quality and response latency. Our findings highlight the need for dynamic task strategies that integrate decision-making, query interpretation, and global knowledge understanding to improve RAG generalizability. We believe HawkBench serves as a pivotal benchmark for advancing the resilience of RAG methods and their ability to achieve general-purpose information seeking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Neuri...</summary><p>Neurips 25 DB Track, Spotlight</p></details> |

This paper introduces ReproRAG, a comprehensive benchmarking framework designed to systematically measure and quantify the reproducibility of vector-based retrieval systems. ReproRAG investigates sources of uncertainty across the entire pipeline, including different embedding models, precision, retrieval algorithms, hardware configurations, and distributed execution environments. Utilizing a suite of metrics, such as Exact Match Rate, Jaccard Similarity, and Kendall's Tau, the proposed framework effectively characterizes the trade-offs between reproducibility and performance. Our large-scale empirical study reveals critical insights; for instance, we observe that different embedding models have remarkable impact on RAG reproducibility. The open-sourced ReproRAG framework provides researchers and engineers productive tools to validate deployments, benchmark reproducibility, and make informed design decisions, thereby fostering more trustworthy AI for science.</p></details> |  |

Researchers have explored methods for automatically generating counterspeech to health misinformation as a mitigation strategy. Existing approaches often produce uniform responses, ignoring that the health literacy level of the audience could affect the accessibility and effectiveness of counterspeech. We propose a Controlled-Literacy framework using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with reinforcement learning (RL) to generate tailored counterspeech adapted to different health literacy levels. In particular, we retrieve knowledge aligned with specific health literacy levels, enabling accessible and factual information to support generation. We design a reward function incorporating subjective user preferences and objective readability-based rewards to optimize counterspeech to the target health literacy level. Experiment results show that Controlled-Literacy outperforms baselines by generating more accessible and user-preferred counterspeech. This research contributes to more equitable and impactful public health communication by improving the accessibility and comprehension of counterspeech to health misinformation</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Findings of EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Turk-LettuceDetect: A Hallucination Detection Models for Turkish RAG Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17671v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been hindered by their tendency to hallucinate, generating plausible but factually incorrect information. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems attempt to address this issue by grounding responses in external knowledge, hallucination remains a persistent challenge, particularly for morphologically complex, low-resource languages like Turkish. This paper introduces Turk-LettuceDetect, the first suite of hallucination detection models specifically designed for Turkish RAG applications. Building on the LettuceDetect framework, we formulate hallucination detection as a token-level classification task and fine-tune three distinct encoder architectures: a Turkish-specific ModernBERT, TurkEmbed4STS, and multilingual EuroBERT. These models were trained on a machine-translated version of the RAGTruth benchmark dataset containing 17,790 instances across question answering, data-to-text generation, and summarization tasks. Our experimental results show that the ModernBERT-based model achieves an F1-score of 0.7266 on the complete test set, with particularly strong performance on structured tasks. The models maintain computational efficiency while supporting long contexts up to 8,192 tokens, making them suitable for real-time deployment. Comparative analysis reveals that while state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate high recall, they suffer from low precision due to over-generation of hallucinated content, underscoring the necessity of specialized detection mechanisms. By releasing our models and translated dataset, this work addresses a critical gap in multilingual NLP and establishes a foundation for developing more reliable and trustworthy AI applications for Turkish and other languages.</p></details> |  |
| **[UR$^2$: Unify RAG and Reasoning through Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06165v3)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities through two complementary paradigms: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which enhances knowledge grounding, and Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), which optimizes complex reasoning abilities. However, these two capabilities are often developed in isolation, and existing efforts to unify them remain narrow in scope -- typically limited to open-domain QA with fixed retrieval settings and task-specific constraints. This lack of integration constrains generalization and limits the applicability of RAG-RL methods to broader domains. To bridge this gap, we propose UR2 (Unified RAG and Reasoning), a general framework that unifies retrieval and reasoning through reinforcement learning. UR2 introduces two key contributions: a difficulty-aware curriculum training that selectively invokes retrieval only for challenging problems, and a hybrid knowledge access strategy combining domain-specific offline corpora with LLM-generated summaries. These components are designed to enable dynamic coordination between retrieval and reasoning, improving adaptability across a diverse range of tasks. Experiments across open-domain QA, MMLU-Pro, medical, and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that UR$^2$ (built on Qwen-2.5-3/7B and LLaMA-3.1-8B) significantly outperforms existing RAG and RL methods, achieving comparable performance to GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4.1-mini on several benchmarks.

| **[EviNote-RAG: Enhancing RAG Models via Answer-Supportive Evidence Notes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00877v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has advanced open-domain question answering by incorporating external information into model reasoning. However, effectively leveraging external information to enhance reasoning presents the following challenges: (1) low signal-to-noise ratio, where answer-supportive external information is diluted by irrelevant material, and (2) error accumulation, which arises in multi-hop reasoning when incomplete or misleading information is incorporated. To address these challenges, we introduce EviNote-RAG, a framework that follows a retrieve-note-answer workflow. Instead of reasoning directly over raw external information, the model first produces Supportive-Evidence Notes (SENs), which concisely preserve answer-critical information and explicitly mark key and uncertainty information to improve accuracy. We further design an entailment-based Evidence Quality Reward (EQR) to ensure that SENs are logically sufficient to derive the final answer, thereby enhancing SENs' quality. Experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain QA benchmarks show that EviNote-RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving answer accuracy, training stability, robustness, and efficiency. In particular, it yields relative F1 gains of 20% on HotpotQA (+0.093), 40% on Bamboogle (+0.151), and 91% on 2Wiki (+0.256), benefiting from improvements in the reasoning process.</p></details> |  |

Yet, a pressing challenge remains: How can we trust these agents especially in zero-shot settings with no fine-tuning? We introduce a novel modular Agentic AI visual classification framework that integrates generalist multimodal agents with a non-visual reasoning orchestrator and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module. Applied to apple leaf disease diagnosis, we benchmark three configurations: (I) zero-shot with confidence-based orchestration, (II) fine-tuned agents with improved performance, and (III) trust-calibrated orchestration enhanced by CLIP-based image retrieval and re-evaluation loops. Using confidence calibration metrics (ECE, OCR, CCC), the orchestrator modulates trust across agents. Our results demonstrate a 77.94\% accuracy improvement in the zero-shot setting using trust-aware orchestration and RAG, achieving 85.63\% overall. GPT-4o showed better calibration, while Qwen-2.5-VL displayed overconfidence. Furthermore, image-RAG grounded predictions with visually similar cases, enabling correction of agent overconfidence via iterative re-evaluation. The proposed system separates perception (vision agents) from meta-reasoning (orchestrator), enabling scalable and interpretable multi-agent AI. This blueprint illustrates how Agentic AI can deliver trustworthy, modular, and transparent reasoning, and is extensible to diagnostics, biology, and other trust-critical domains. In doing so, we highlight Agentic AI not just as an architecture but as a paradigm for building reliable multi-agent intelligence. agentic ai, orchestrator agent trust, trust orchestration, visual classification, retrieval augmented reasoning</p></details> |  |

Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as novel aids for information retrieval during learning. While LLMs are effective for general-purpose question-answering, they typically lack alignment with the domain knowledge of specific course materials such as textbooks and slides. We investigate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG, a knowledge graph-enhanced RAG approach, for page-level question answering in an undergraduate mathematics textbook. While RAG has been effective for retrieving discrete, contextually relevant passages, GraphRAG may excel in modeling interconnected concepts and hierarchical knowledge structures. We curate a dataset of 477 question-answer pairs, each tied to a distinct textbook page. We then compare the standard embedding-based RAG methods to GraphRAG for evaluating both retrieval accuracy-whether the correct page is retrieved-and generated answer quality via F1 scores. Our findings show that embedding-based RAG achieves higher retrieval accuracy and better F1 scores compared to GraphRAG, which tends to retrieve excessive and sometimes irrelevant content due to its entity-based structure. We also explored re-ranking the retrieved pages with LLM and observed mixed results, including performance drop and hallucinations when dealing with larger context windows. Overall, this study highlights both the promises and challenges of page-level retrieval systems in educational contexts, emphasizing the need for more refined retrieval methods to build reliable AI tutoring solutions in providing reference page numbers.</p></details> |  |

Traditional retrieval systems rely on a single database and retriever, but financial applications require more sophisticated approaches to handle intricate regulatory filings, market analyses, and extensive multi-year reports. We introduce a framework for financial Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that leverages agentic AI and the Multi-HyDE system, an approach that generates multiple, nonequivalent queries to boost the effectiveness and coverage of retrieval from large, structured financial corpora. Our pipeline is optimized for token efficiency and multi-step financial reasoning, and we demonstrate that their combination improves accuracy by 11.2% and reduces hallucinations by 15%. Our method is evaluated on standard financial QA benchmarks, showing that integrating domain-specific retrieval mechanisms such as Multi-HyDE with robust toolsets, including keyword and table-based retrieval, significantly enhances both the accuracy and reliability of answers. This research not only delivers a modular, adaptable retrieval framework for finance but also highlights the importance of structured agent workflows and multi-perspective retrieval for trustworthy deployment of AI in high-stakes financial applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 Pa...</summary><p>14 Pages, 8 Tables, 2 Figures.

| **[Causal-Counterfactual RAG: The Integration of Causal-Counterfactual Reasoning into RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14435v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing (NLP), enabling diverse applications by integrating large-scale pre-trained knowledge. However, their static knowledge limits dynamic reasoning over external information, especially in knowledge-intensive domains. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this challenge by combining retrieval mechanisms with generative modeling to improve contextual understanding. Traditional RAG systems suffer from disrupted contextual integrity due to text chunking and over-reliance on semantic similarity for retrieval, often resulting in shallow and less accurate responses. We propose Causal-Counterfactual RAG, a novel framework that integrates explicit causal graphs representing cause-effect relationships into the retrieval process and incorporates counterfactual reasoning grounded on the causal structure. Unlike conventional methods, our framework evaluates not only direct causal evidence but also the counterfactuality of associated causes, combining results from both to generate more robust, accurate, and interpretable answers. By leveraging causal pathways and associated hypothetical scenarios, Causal-Counterfactual RAG preserves contextual coherence, reduces hallucination, and enhances reasoning fidelity.</p></details> |  |

The current version of the tool supports the legal TAI assessment, with a particular emphasis on facilitating compliance with the AI Act. It involves a two-step approach with a pre-screening and an assessment phase. The assessment output of the system includes insight regarding the risk-level of the AI system according to the AI Act, while at the same time retrieving relevant articles to aid with compliance and notify on their obligations. Our qualitative evaluation using use-case scenarios yields promising results, correctly predicting risk levels while retrieving relevant articles across three distinct semantic groups. Furthermore, interpretation of results shows that the tool's reasoning relies on comparison with the setting of high-risk systems, a behaviour attributed to their deployment requiring careful consideration, and therefore frequently presented within the AI Act.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 1 figure, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[SIRAG: Towards Stable and Interpretable RAG with A Process-Supervised Multi-Agent Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18167v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to access external knowledge sources, but the effectiveness of RAG relies on the coordination between the retriever and the generator. Since these components are developed independently, their interaction is often suboptimal: the retriever may return irrelevant or redundant documents, while the generator may fail to fully leverage retrieved evidence. In this work, we propose a process-supervised multi-agent framework to bridge the gap between retriever and generator. The framework introduces two lightweight agents: a Decision Maker, which determines when to continue retrieval or stop for answer generation, and a Knowledge Selector, which filters retrieved documents to retain only the most useful evidence. To provide fine-grained supervision, we employ an LLM-as-a-Judge that evaluates each intermediate action with process-level rewards, ensuring more accurate credit assignment than relying solely on final answer correctness. We further adopt a tree-structured rollout strategy to explore diverse reasoning paths, and train both agents with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on single-hop and multi-hop question answering benchmarks show that our approach achieves higher accuracy, more stable convergence, and produces more interpretable reasoning trajectories compared with standard RAG baselines. Importantly, the proposed framework is modular and plug-and-play, requiring no modification to the retriever or generator, making it practical for real-world RAG applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages,2 figures, IRAC under review</p></details> |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by incorporating external information, often from graph-structured data. However, existing graph-based RAG methods suffer from poor graph quality due to incomplete extraction and insufficient utilization of query information during retrieval. To overcome these limitations, we propose Clue-RAG, a novel approach that introduces (1) a multi-partite graph index incorporates Chunk, knowledge unit, and entity to capture semantic content at multiple levels of granularity, coupled with a hybrid extraction strategy that reduces LLM token usage while still producing accurate and disambiguated knowledge units, and (2) Q-Iter, a query-driven iterative retrieval strategy that enhances relevance through semantic search and constrained graph traversal. Experiments on three QA benchmarks show that Clue-RAG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 99.33% higher Accuracy and 113.51% higher F1 score while reducing indexing costs by 72.58%. Remarkably, Clue-RAG matches or outperforms baselines even without using an LLM for indexing. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of Clue-RAG in advancing graph-based RAG systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAGs to Riches: RAG-like Few-shot Learning for Large Language Model Role-playing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12168v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Role-playing Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, education, and governance, where failures can directly impact user trust and well-being. A cost effective paradigm for LLM role-playing is few-shot learning, but existing approaches often cause models to break character in unexpected and potentially harmful ways, especially when interacting with hostile users. Inspired by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we reformulate LLM role-playing into a text retrieval problem and propose a new prompting framework called RAGs-to-Riches, which leverages curated reference demonstrations to condition LLM responses. We evaluate our framework with LLM-as-a-judge preference voting and introduce two novel token-level ROUGE metrics: Intersection over Output (IOO) to quantity how much an LLM improvises and Intersection over References (IOR) to measure few-shot demonstrations utilization rate during the evaluation tasks. When simulating interactions with a hostile user, our prompting strategy incorporates in its responses during inference an average of 35% more tokens from the reference demonstrations. As a result, across 453 role-playing interactions, our models are consistently judged as being more authentic, and remain in-character more often than zero-shot and in-context Learning (ICL) methods. Our method presents a scalable strategy for building robust, human-aligned LLM role-playing frameworks.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches often rely on heavy training and large computational resources. While foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) offer strong generalization, they still struggle to handle COD tasks without fine-tuning and require high-quality prompts to yield good performance. However, generating such prompts manually is costly and inefficient. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{First RAG, Second SEG (RAG-SEG)}, a training-free paradigm that decouples COD into two stages: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for generating coarse masks as prompts, followed by SAM-based segmentation (SEG) for refinement. RAG-SEG constructs a compact retrieval database via unsupervised clustering, enabling fast and effective feature retrieval. During inference, the retrieved features produce pseudo-labels that guide precise mask generation using SAM2. Our method eliminates the need for conventional training while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark COD datasets demonstrate that RAG-SEG performs on par with or surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Notably, all experiments are conducted on a \textbf{personal laptop}, highlighting the computational efficiency and practicality of our approach. We present further analysis in the Appendix, covering limitations, salient object detection extension, and possible improvements. \textcolor{blue} {Code: https://github.com/Lwt-diamond/RAG-SEG.}</p></details> |  |

To enhance its domain-specific capabilities, we integrated Retrieval Augmented Generation(RAG), which augments model outputs with relevant information retrieved from an external knowledge source. GeoGPT uses RAG to draw from the GeoGPT Library, a specialized corpus curated for geoscientific content, enabling it to generate accurate, context-specific answers. Users can also create personalized knowledge bases by uploading their own publication lists, allowing GeoGPT to retrieve and respond using user-provided materials. To further improve retrieval quality and domain alignment, we fine-tuned both the embedding model and a ranking model that scores retrieved passages by relevance to the query. These enhancements optimize RAG for geoscience applications and significantly improve the system's ability to deliver precise and trustworthy outputs. GeoGPT reflects a strong commitment to open science through its emphasis on collaboration, transparency, and community driven development. As part of this commitment, we have open-sourced two core RAG components-GeoEmbedding and GeoReranker-to support geoscientists, researchers, and professionals worldwide with powerful, accessible AI tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 10 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

This paper introduces the Structure-Aware Temporal Graph RAG (SAT-Graph RAG), an ontology-driven framework designed to overcome these limitations by explicitly modeling the formal structure and diachronic nature of legal norms. We ground our knowledge graph in a formal, LRMoo-inspired model that distinguishes abstract legal Works from their versioned Expressions. We model temporal states as efficient aggregations that reuse the versioned expressions (CTVs) of unchanged components, and we reify legislative events as first-class Action nodes to make causality explicit and queryable. This structured backbone enables a unified, planner-guided query strategy that applies explicit policies to deterministically resolve complex requests for (i) point-in-time retrieval, (ii) hierarchical impact analysis, and (iii) auditable provenance reconstruction. Through a case study on the Brazilian Constitution, we demonstrate how this approach provides a verifiable, temporally-correct substrate for LLMs, enabling higher-order analytical capabilities while drastically reducing the risk of factual errors. The result is a practical framework for building more trustworthy and explainable legal AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Major...</summary><p>Major revision for clarity and academic precision.

| **[MetaRAG: Metamorphic Testing for Hallucination Detection in RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09360v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in enterprise applications, yet their reliability remains limited by hallucinations, i.e., confident but factually incorrect information. Existing detection approaches, such as SelfCheckGPT and MetaQA, primarily target standalone LLMs and do not address the unique challenges of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, where responses must be consistent with retrieved evidence. We therefore present MetaRAG, a metamorphic testing framework for hallucination detection in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. MetaRAG operates in a real-time, unsupervised, black-box setting, requiring neither ground-truth references nor access to model internals, making it suitable for proprietary and high-stakes domains. The framework proceeds in four stages: (1) decompose answers into atomic factoids, (2) generate controlled mutations of each factoid using synonym and antonym substitutions, (3) verify each variant against the retrieved context (synonyms are expected to be entailed and antonyms contradicted), and (4) aggregate penalties for inconsistencies into a response-level hallucination score. Crucially for identity-aware AI, MetaRAG localizes unsupported claims at the factoid span where they occur (e.g., pregnancy-specific precautions, LGBTQ+ refugee rights, or labor eligibility), allowing users to see flagged spans and enabling system designers to configure thresholds and guardrails for identity-sensitive queries. Experiments on a proprietary enterprise dataset illustrate the effectiveness of MetaRAG for detecting hallucinations and enabling trustworthy deployment of RAG-based conversational agents. We also outline a topic-based deployment design that translates MetaRAG's span-level scores into identity-aware safeguards; this design is discussed but not evaluated in our experiments.</p></details> | under review |

Although InfluenceMap has made progress with automating key elements of the analytical workflow, a significant portion of the assessment remains manual, making it time- and labor-intensive and susceptible to human error. We propose an AI-assisted framework to accelerate the monitoring of corporate climate policy engagement by leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation to automate the most time-intensive extraction of relevant evidence from large-scale textual data. Our evaluation shows that a combination of layout-aware parsing, the Nomic embedding model, and few-shot prompting strategies yields the best performance in extracting and classifying evidence from multilingual corporate documents. We conclude that while the automated RAG system effectively accelerates evidence extraction, the nuanced nature of the analysis necessitates a human-in-the-loop approach where the technology augments, rather than replaces, expert judgment to ensure accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Ensemble for RAG: Role of Context Length in Zero-Shot Question Answering for BioASQ Challenge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08596v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biomedical question answering (QA) poses significant challenges due to the need for precise interpretation of specialized knowledge drawn from a vast, complex, and rapidly evolving corpus. In this work, we explore how large language models (LLMs) can be used for information retrieval (IR), and an ensemble of zero-shot models can accomplish state-of-the-art performance on a domain-specific Yes/No QA task. Evaluating our approach on the BioASQ challenge tasks, we show that ensembles can outperform individual LLMs and in some cases rival or surpass domain-tuned systems - all while preserving generalizability and avoiding the need for costly fine-tuning or labeled data. Our method aggregates outputs from multiple LLM variants, including models from Anthropic and Google, to synthesize more accurate and robust answers. Moreover, our investigation highlights a relationship between context length and performance: while expanded contexts are meant to provide valuable evidence, they simultaneously risk information dilution and model disorientation. These findings emphasize IR as a critical foundation in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches for biomedical QA systems. Precise, focused retrieval remains essential for ensuring LLMs operate within relevant information boundaries when generating answers from retrieved documents. Our results establish that ensemble-based zero-shot approaches, when paired with effective RAG pipelines, constitute a practical and scalable alternative to domain-tuned systems for biomedical question answering.</p></details> | CEUR-WS, CLEF2025 |

This capability is especially critical in the legal domain. In this work, we introduce a novel end-to-end RAG pipeline that improves upon previous baselines using three targeted enhancements: (i) a context-aware query translator that disentangles document references from natural-language questions and adapts retrieval depth and response style based on expertise and specificity, (ii) open-source retrieval strategies using SBERT and GTE embeddings that achieve substantial performance gains while remaining cost-efficient, and (iii) a comprehensive evaluation and generation framework that combines RAGAS, BERTScore-F1, and ROUGE-Recall to assess semantic alignment and faithfulness across models and prompt designs. Our results show that carefully designed open-source pipelines can rival proprietary approaches in retrieval quality, while a custom legal-grounded prompt consistently produces more faithful and contextually relevant answers than baseline prompting. Taken together, these contributions demonstrate the potential of task-aware, component-level tuning to deliver legally grounded, reproducible, and cost-effective RAG systems for legal research assistance.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to NLLP 2025 Workshop</p></details> |

Unlike prior methods, TextlessRAG eliminates ASR, TTS and OCR, directly interpreting speech, retrieving relevant visual knowledge, and generating answers in a fully textless pipeline. To further boost performance, we integrate a layout-aware reranking mechanism to refine retrieval. Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in both efficiency and accuracy. To advance research in this direction, we also release the first bilingual speech--document RAG dataset, featuring Chinese and English voice queries paired with multimodal document content.

Conventional machine-learning detectors reduce alert volume but still yield many false positives, while standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines often retrieve irrelevant context and fail to justify predictions. We present CyberRAG, a modular agent-based RAG framework that delivers real-time classification, explanation, and structured reporting for cyber-attacks. A central LLM agent orchestrates: (i) fine-tuned classifiers specialized by attack family; (ii) tool adapters for enrichment and alerting; and (iii) an iterative retrieval-and-reason loop that queries a domain-specific knowledge base until evidence is relevant and self-consistent. Unlike traditional RAG, CyberRAG adopts an agentic design that enables dynamic control flow and adaptive reasoning. This architecture autonomously refines threat labels and natural-language justifications, reducing false positives and enhancing interpretability. It is also extensible: new attack types can be supported by adding classifiers without retraining the core agent. CyberRAG was evaluated on SQL Injection, XSS, and SSTI, achieving over 94\% accuracy per class and a final classification accuracy of 94.92\% through semantic orchestration. Generated explanations reached 0.94 in BERTScore and 4.9/5 in GPT-4-based expert evaluation, with robustness preserved against adversarial and unseen payloads. These results show that agentic, specialist-oriented RAG can combine high detection accuracy with trustworthy, SOC-ready prose, offering a flexible path toward partially automated cyber-defense workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Iterative LLM Framework for SIBT utilizing RAG-based Adaptive Weight Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08407v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Seed implant brachytherapy (SIBT) is an effective cancer treatment modality; however, clinical planning often relies on manual adjustment of objective function weights, leading to inefficiencies and suboptimal results. This study proposes an adaptive weight optimization framework for SIBT planning, driven by large language models (LLMs). A locally deployed DeepSeek-R1 LLM is integrated with an automatic planning algorithm in an iterative loop. Starting with fixed weights, the LLM evaluates plan quality and recommends new weights in the next iteration. This process continues until convergence criteria are met, after which the LLM conducts a comprehensive evaluation to identify the optimal plan. A clinical knowledge base, constructed and queried via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), enhances the model's domain-specific reasoning. The proposed method was validated on 23 patient cases, showing that the LLM-assisted approach produces plans that are comparable to or exceeding clinically approved and fixed-weight plans, in terms of dose homogeneity for the clinical target volume (CTV) and sparing of organs at risk (OARs). The study demonstrates the potential use of LLMs in SIBT planning automation.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce a novel multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (MM-RAG) framework. On top of classical RAG architecture, we further the framework to devise a two-branch multimodal encoder structure that the image branch employs a visual encoder composed of ResNet and Transformer to extract the characteristic of building damage after disaster, and the text branch harnesses a BERT retriever for the text vectorization of posts as well as insurance policies and for the construction of a retrievable restoration index. To impose cross-modal semantic alignment, the model integrates a cross-modal interaction module to bridge the semantic representation between image and text via multi-head attention. Meanwhile, in the generation module, the introduced modal attention gating mechanism dynamically controls the role of visual evidence and text prior information during generation. The entire framework takes end-to-end training, and combines the comparison loss, the retrieval loss and the generation loss to form multi-task optimization objectives, and achieves image understanding and policy matching in collaborative learning. The results demonstrate superior performance in retrieval accuracy and classification index on damage severity, where the Top-1 retrieval accuracy has been improved by 9.6%.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) improves reliability of LLMs by grounding responses in external resources. We investigate two accessible RAG paradigms, vector-based retrieval and graph-based retrieval to identify best practices for classroom question answering (QA). Existing comparative studies fail to account for pedagogical factors such as educational disciplines, question types, and practical deployment costs. Using a novel dataset, EduScopeQA, of 3,176 questions across academic subjects, we measure performance on various educational query types, from specific facts to broad thematic discussions. We also evaluate system alignment with a dataset of systematically altered textbooks that contradict the LLM's latent knowledge. We find that OpenAI Vector Search RAG (representing vector-based RAG) performs well as a low-cost generalist, especially for quick fact retrieval. On the other hand, GraphRAG Global excels at providing pedagogically rich answers to thematic queries, and GraphRAG Local achieves the highest accuracy with the dense, altered textbooks when corpus integrity is critical. Accounting for the 10-20x higher resource usage of GraphRAG (representing graph-based RAG), we show that a dynamic branching framework that routes queries to the optimal retrieval method boosts fidelity and efficiency. These insights provide actionable guidelines for educators and system designers to integrate RAG-augmented LLMs into learning environments effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

However, most existing RAG research in finance focuses predominantly on textual data, overlooking the rich visual content in financial documents, resulting in the loss of key analytical insights.

It includes a bilingual retrieval corpus with 60,780 Chinese and 51,219 English pages, along with a high-quality, human-annotated question-answering (QA) dataset spanning heterogeneous data types and seven question categories. Moreover, we introduce RGenCite, an RAG baseline that seamlessly integrates visual citation with generation. Furthermore, we propose an automatic citation evaluation method to systematically assess the visual citation capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Extensive experiments on RGenCite underscore the challenging nature of FinRAGBench-V, providing valuable insights for the development of multimodal RAG systems in finance.</p></details> |  |

Existing coarse-ranking optimization approaches often struggle to balance domain-specific knowledge learning with query enhencement, resulting in suboptimal retrieval performance. To address this challenge, we propose MoLER, a domain-aware RAG method that uses MoL-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning to optimize retrieval. MoLER has a two-stage pipeline: a continual pre-training (CPT) phase using a Mixture of Losses (MoL) to balance domain-specific knowledge with general language capabilities, and a reinforcement learning (RL) phase leveraging Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to optimize query and passage generation for maximizing document recall. A key innovation is our Multi-query Single-passage Late Fusion (MSLF) strategy, which reduces computational overhead during RL training while maintaining scalable inference via Multi-query Multi-passage Late Fusion (MMLF). Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that MoLER achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming baseline methods. MoLER bridges the knowledge gap in RAG systems, enabling robust and scalable retrieval in specialized domains.</p></details> |  |

However, LLMs often fail to faithfully integrate retrieved evidence into their generated responses, leading to factual inconsistencies. To quantify this gap, we introduce Entity-Context Divergence (ECD), a metric that measures the extent to which retrieved information is accurately reflected in model outputs. We systematically evaluate contemporary LLMs on their ability to preserve factual consistency in retrieval-augmented settings, a capability we define as RAG-ability. Our empirical analysis reveals that RAG-ability remains low across most LLMs, highlighting significant challenges in entity retention and context fidelity. This paper introduces Radiant (Retrieval AugmenteD entIty-context AligNmenT), a novel framework that merges RAG with alignment designed to optimize the interplay between retrieved evidence and generated content. Radiant extends Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to teach LLMs how to integrate provided additional information into subsequent generations. As a behavior correction mechanism, Radiant boosts RAG performance across varied retrieval scenarios, such as noisy web contexts, knowledge conflicts, and hallucination reduction. This enables more reliable, contextually grounded, and factually coherent content generation.</p></details> |  |

Addressing the shortcomings of conventional health search engines and the lag in public access to biomedical research, the system integrates diverse sources, including PubMed articles, curated Q&A datasets, and medical encyclopedias ,to retrieve relevant information and generate concise, context-aware responses. The retrieval pipeline uses MiniLM-based semantic embeddings and FAISS vector search, while answer generation is performed by a fine-tuned Mistral-7B-v0.3 language model optimized using QLoRA for efficient, low-resource training. The system supports both general medical queries and domain-specific tasks, with a focused evaluation on breast cancer literature demonstrating the value of domain-aligned retrieval. Empirical results, measured using BERTScore (F1), show substantial improvements in factual consistency and semantic relevance compared to baseline models. The findings underscore the potential of RAG-enhanced language models to bridge the gap between complex biomedical literature and accessible public health knowledge, paving the way for future work on multilingual adaptation, privacy-preserving inference, and personalized medical AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Graph RAG as Human Choice Model: Building a Data-Driven Mobility Agent with Preference Chain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16172v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding human behavior in urban environments is a crucial field within city sciences. However, collecting accurate behavioral data, particularly in newly developed areas, poses significant challenges. Recent advances in generative agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), have shown promise in simulating human behaviors without relying on extensive datasets. Nevertheless, these methods often struggle with generating consistent, context-sensitive, and realistic behavioral outputs. To address these limitations, this paper introduces the Preference Chain, a novel method that integrates Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LLMs to enhance context-aware simulation of human behavior in transportation systems. Experiments conducted on the Replica dataset demonstrate that the Preference Chain outperforms standard LLM in aligning with real-world transportation mode choices. The development of the Mobility Agent highlights potential applications of proposed method in urban mobility modeling for emerging cities, personalized travel behavior analysis, and dynamic traffic forecasting. Despite limitations such as slow inference and the risk of hallucination, the method offers a promising framework for simulating complex human behavior in data-scarce environments, where traditional data-driven models struggle due to limited data availability.</p></details> |  |

Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization for Preserving Agentic RAG Capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20324v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a post-training approach to elicit agentic RAG behaviors such as search and planning from language models. However, compact language models (e.g., 0.5B parameters) struggle due to poor reasoning ability, resulting in sparse rewards and unstable training. To overcome these difficulties, we propose Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization (DGPO), which addresses the challenges through cold-start initialization from teacher demonstrations and continuous teacher guidance during policy optimization. To systematically evaluate our approach, we introduce Agentic RAG Capabilities (ARC), a fine-grained metric analyzing reasoning, search coordination, and response synthesis. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that DGPO enables compact models to achieve sophisticated agentic search behaviors, even outperforming the larger teacher model in some cases. DGPO makes agentic RAG feasible in computing resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  |

Our approach addresses the challenges of understanding and retrieving complex technical content by leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). First, we enhance user queries by generating expanded representations that better capture user intent and improve dataset diversity, thereby enriching the fine-tuning process for embedding models. Second, we apply summary extraction techniques to encode essential contextual information, refining the representation of technical documents. To further enhance retrieval performance, we fine-tune a bi-encoder BERT model using soft prompting, incorporating separate learning parameters for queries and document context to capture fine-grained semantic nuances. We evaluate our approach on two public datasets, RAG-EDA and Rust-Docs-QA, demonstrating that Technical-Embeddings significantly outperforms baseline models in both precision and recall. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating query expansion and contextual summarization to enhance information access and comprehension in technical domains. This work advances the state of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, offering new avenues for efficient and accurate technical document retrieval in engineering and product development workflows.</p></details> |  |

This section serves as a valuable resource for early-career researchers seeking unexplored areas and experienced researchers looking for new projects or collaborations. In this study, we generate future work suggestions from a scientific article. To enrich the generation process with broader insights and reduce the chance of missing important research directions, we use context from related papers using RAG. We experimented with various Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). We incorporate an LLM feedback mechanism to enhance the quality of the generated content and introduce an LLM-as-a-judge framework for robust evaluation, assessing key aspects such as novelty, hallucination, and feasibility. Our results demonstrate that the RAG-based approach using GPT-4o mini, combined with an LLM feedback mechanism, outperforms other methods based on both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

| **[Explainable Knowledge Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) with KG-SMILE](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03626v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), has achieved impressive progress but still produces hallucinations and unverifiable claims, limiting reliability in sensitive domains. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves accuracy by grounding outputs in external knowledge, especially in domains like healthcare, where precision is vital. However, RAG remains opaque and essentially a black box, heavily dependent on data quality. We developed a method-agnostic, perturbation-based framework that provides token and component-level interoperability for Graph RAG using SMILE and named it as Knowledge-Graph (KG)-SMILE. By applying controlled perturbations, computing similarities, and training weighted linear surrogates, KG-SMILE identifies the graph entities and relations most influential to generated outputs, thereby making RAG more transparent. We evaluate KG-SMILE using comprehensive attribution metrics, including fidelity, faithfulness, consistency, stability, and accuracy. Our findings show that KG-SMILE produces stable, human-aligned explanations, demonstrating its capacity to balance model effectiveness with interpretability and thereby fostering greater transparency and trust in machine learning technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Iterative RAG for Knowledge Visual Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00798v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced multimodal understanding, their performance remains limited on knowledge-intensive visual questions that require external knowledge beyond the image. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a promising solution for providing models with external knowledge, its conventional single-pass framework often fails to gather sufficient knowledge. To overcome this limitation, we propose MI-RAG, a Multimodal Iterative RAG framework that leverages reasoning to enhance retrieval and update reasoning over newly retrieved knowledge across modalities. At each iteration, MI-RAG leverages an accumulated reasoning record to dynamically formulate a multi-query. These queries then drive a joint search across heterogeneous knowledge bases containing both visually-grounded and textual knowledge. The newly acquired knowledge is synthesized into the reasoning record, progressively refining understanding across iterations. Experiments on challenging benchmarks, including Encyclopedic VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA, show that MI-RAG significantly improves both retrieval recall and answer accuracy, establishing a scalable approach for compositional reasoning in knowledge-intensive VQA.</p></details> |  |

However, effectively combining evidence from these heterogeneous sources is challenging as the respective similarity scores are not inter-comparable. Additionally, aggregating beliefs from the outputs of multiple rankers can improve the effectiveness of RAG. Our proposed method first aggregates the top-documents from a number of IR models using a standard rank fusion technique for each source (labeled and unlabeled). Next, we standardize the retrieval score distributions within each source by applying z-score transformation before merging the top-retrieved documents from the two sources. We evaluate our approach on the fact verification task, demonstrating that it consistently improves over the best-performing individual ranker or source and also shows better out-of-domain generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[VaccineRAG: Boosting Multimodal Large Language Models' Immunity to Harmful RAG Samples](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04502v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances the response accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating retrieval and generation modules with external knowledge, demonstrating particular strength in real-time queries and Visual Question Answering tasks. However, the effectiveness of RAG is frequently hindered by the precision of the retriever: many retrieved samples fed into the generation phase are irrelevant or misleading, posing a critical bottleneck to LLMs' performance. To address this challenge, we introduce VaccineRAG, a novel Chain-of-Thought-based retrieval-augmented generation dataset. On one hand, VaccineRAG employs a benchmark to evaluate models using data with varying positive/negative sample ratios, systematically exposing inherent weaknesses in current LLMs. On the other hand, it enhances models' sample-discrimination capabilities by prompting LLMs to generate explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) analysis for each sample before producing final answers. Furthermore, to enhance the model's ability to learn long-sequence complex CoT content, we propose Partial-GRPO. By modeling the outputs of LLMs as multiple components rather than a single whole, our model can make more informed preference selections for complex sequences, thereby enhancing its capacity to learn complex CoT. Comprehensive evaluations and ablation studies on VaccineRAG validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The code and dataset will be publicly released soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[FinS-Pilot: A Benchmark for Online Financial RAG System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02037v2)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various professional domains, with their performance typically evaluated through standardized benchmarks. In the financial field, the stringent demands for professional accuracy and real-time data processing often necessitate the use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques. However, the development of financial RAG benchmarks has been constrained by data confidentiality issues and the lack of dynamic data integration. To address this issue, we introduce FinS-Pilot, a novel benchmark for evaluating RAG systems in online financial applications. Constructed from real-world financial assistant interactions, our benchmark incorporates both real-time API data and text data, organized through an intent classification framework covering critical financial domains. The benchmark enables comprehensive evaluation of financial assistants' capabilities in handling both static knowledge and time-sensitive market information.Through systematic experiments with multiple Chinese leading LLMs, we demonstrate FinS-Pilot's effectiveness in identifying models suitable for financial applications while addressing the current gap in specialized evaluation tools for the financial domain. Our work contributes both a practical evaluation framework and a curated dataset to advance research in financial NLP systems. The code and dataset are accessible on GitHub.</p></details> |  |
| **[REFRAG: Rethinking RAG based Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01092v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in leveraging extensive external knowledge to enhance responses in multi-turn and agentic applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, processing long-context inputs introduces significant system latency and demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced throughput and a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system efficiency. While minimizing latency for long-context inputs is a primary objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG require specialized consideration. In RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated passages from retrieval, with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages often exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during re-ranking, leading to block-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those in standard LLM generation tasks. Based on this observation, we argue that most computations over the RAG context during decoding are unnecessary and can be eliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose REFRAG, an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve latency in RAG applications. By exploiting the sparsity structure, we demonstrate a 30.85 the time-to-first-token acceleration (3.75 improvement to previous work) without loss in perplexity. In addition, our optimization framework for large context enables REFRAG to extend the context size of LLMs by 16. We provide rigorous validation of REFRAG across diverse long-context tasks, including RAG, multi-turn conversations, and long document summarization, spanning a wide range of datasets. Experimental results confirm that REFRAG delivers substantial speedup with no loss in accuracy compared to LLaMA models and other state-of-the-art baselines across various context sizes.</p></details> |  |
| **[OCR Hinders RAG: Evaluating the Cascading Impact of OCR on Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02592v4)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge to reduce hallucinations and incorporate up-to-date information without retraining. As an essential part of RAG, external knowledge bases are commonly built by extracting structured data from unstructured PDF documents using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However, given the imperfect prediction of OCR and the inherent non-uniform representation of structured data, knowledge bases inevitably contain various OCR noises. In this paper, we introduce OHRBench, the first benchmark for understanding the cascading impact of OCR on RAG systems. OHRBench includes 8,561 carefully selected unstructured document images from seven real-world RAG application domains, along with 8,498 Q&A pairs derived from multimodal elements in documents, challenging existing OCR solutions used for RAG. To better understand OCR's impact on RAG systems, we identify two primary types of OCR noise: Semantic Noise and Formatting Noise and apply perturbation to generate a set of structured data with varying degrees of each OCR noise. Using OHRBench, we first conduct a comprehensive evaluation of current OCR solutions and reveal that none is competent for constructing high-quality knowledge bases for RAG systems. We then systematically evaluate the impact of these two noise types and demonstrate the trend relationship between the degree of OCR noise and RAG performance. Our OHRBench, including PDF documents, Q&As, and the ground truth structured data are released at: https://github.com/opendatalab/OHR-Bench</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[What Breaks Knowledge Graph based RAG? Empirical Insights into Reasoning under Incomplete Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08344v2)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) is an increasingly explored approach for combining the reasoning capabilities of large language models with the structured evidence of knowledge graphs. However, current evaluation practices fall short: existing benchmarks often include questions that can be directly answered using existing triples in KG, making it unclear whether models perform reasoning or simply retrieve answers directly. Moreover, inconsistent evaluation metrics and lenient answer matching criteria further obscure meaningful comparisons. In this work, we introduce a general method for constructing benchmarks, together with an evaluation protocol, to systematically assess KG-RAG methods under knowledge incompleteness. Our empirical results show that current KG-RAG methods have limited reasoning ability under missing knowledge, often rely on internal memorization, and exhibit varying degrees of generalization depending on their design.</p></details> |  |
| **[MODE: Mixture of Document Experts for RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00100v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) often relies on large vector databases and cross-encoders tuned for large-scale corpora, which can be excessive for small, domain-specific collections. We present MODE (Mixture of Document Experts), a lightweight alternative that replaces fine-grained nearest-neighbor search with cluster-and-route retrieval. Documents are embedded, grouped into semantically coherent clusters, and represented by cached centroids. At query time, we route to the top centroid(s) and retrieve context only within those clusters, eliminating external vector-database infrastructure and reranking while keeping latency low. On HotpotQA and SQuAD corpora with 100-500 chunks, MODE matches or exceeds a dense-retrieval baseline in answer quality while reducing end-to-end retrieval time. Ablations show that cluster granularity and multi-cluster routing control the recall/precision trade-off, and that tighter clusters improve downstream accuracy. MODE offers a practical recipe for small and medium corpora where simplicity, speed, and topical focus matter.</p></details> |  |

However, the effectiveness and trustworthiness of these systems critically depends on how they are evaluated, particularly on whether the evaluation process captures real-world constraints like protecting sensitive information. While current evaluation efforts for RAG systems have primarily focused on the development of performance metrics, far less attention has been given to the design and quality of the underlying evaluation datasets, despite their pivotal role in enabling meaningful, reliable assessments. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-agent framework for generating synthetic QA datasets for RAG evaluation that prioritize semantic diversity and privacy preservation. Our approach involves: (1) a Diversity agent leveraging clustering techniques to maximize topical coverage and semantic variability, (2) a Privacy Agent that detects and mask sensitive information across multiple domains and (3) a QA curation agent that synthesizes private and diverse QA pairs suitable as ground truth for RAG evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our evaluation sets outperform baseline methods in diversity and achieve robust privacy masking on domain-specific datasets. This work offers a practical and ethically aligned pathway toward safer, more comprehensive RAG system evaluation, laying the foundation for future enhancements aligned with evolving AI regulations and compliance standards.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECAI ...</summary><p>ECAI 2025 TRUST AI workshop</p></details> |

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) indexing methods aim to address this challenge by selectively retrieving only necessary document segments. However, narrative texts possess unique characteristics that limit the effectiveness of these existing approaches. Specifically, understanding narrative texts requires more than isolated segments, as the broader context and sequential relationships between segments are crucial for comprehension. To address these limitations, we propose ChronoRAG, a novel RAG framework specialized for narrative texts. This approach focuses on two essential aspects: refining dispersed document information into coherent and structured passages, and preserving narrative flow by explicitly capturing and maintaining the temporal order among retrieved passages. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of ChronoRAG through experiments on the NarrativeQA dataset, showing substantial improvements in tasks requiring both factual identification and comprehension of complex sequential relationships, underscoring that reasoning over temporal order is crucial in resolving narrative QA.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

However, co-locating the vector retriever and the LLM on shared GPU infrastructure introduces significant challenges: vector search is memory and I/O intensive, while LLM inference demands high throughput and low latency. Naive resource sharing often leads to severe performance degradation, particularly under high request load or large index sizes. We present VectorLiteRAG, a deployment-friendly RAG system that achieves latency-compliant inference without requiring additional hardware resources. VectorLiteRAG introduces a fine-grained GPU resource allocation mechanism based on detailed performance modeling and access pattern analysis. By estimating search latency and query hit rate distributions, it identifies an optimal index partitioning point across CPU and GPU tiers to minimize contention and maximize throughput. Our evaluations show that VectorLiteRAG consistently expands the SLO compliant request rate range across all tested configurations, including both small and large LLMs, and small and large vector databases compared to naive baselines and state of the art alternatives. In the best case, VectorLiteRAG improves the attainable SLO throughput by up to 1.5 times without compromising generation quality or requiring additional compute resources.</p></details> |  |

Our benchmark is built on a user manual for an agricultural machine, available in English, French, and German. It simulates a cross-lingual information retrieval scenario where questions are posed in English against all three language versions of the manual. The evaluation focuses on realistic "needle-in-a-haystack" challenges and includes unanswerable questions to test for hallucinations. We compare nine long-context LLMs using direct prompting against three Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategies (keyword, semantic, hybrid), with an LLM-as-a-judge for evaluation. Our findings for this specific manual show that Hybrid RAG consistently outperforms direct long-context prompting. Models like Gemini 2.5 Flash and the smaller Qwen 2.5 7B achieve high accuracy (over 85%) across all languages with RAG.

On the first level of analytics, the fine-tuned model generates graph and text summaries with sentiment scores as well as JSON representations of summaries. Higher levels perform hierarchical stacking that consolidates sets of graph-based and text-based summaries as well as summaries of summaries into comprehensive reports. The combination of graph and text summaries provides complementary views of cryptocurrency news. The model is fine-tuned with 4-bit quantization using the PEFT/LoRA approach. The representation of cryptocurrency news as knowledge graph can essentially eliminate problems with large language model hallucinations. The obtained results demonstrate that the use of fine-tuned Mistral 7B LLM models for multilevel cryptocurrency news analysis can conduct informative qualitative and quantitative analytics, providing important insights.</p></details> |  |

Learned query optimizers (LQOs) can improve performance over time by incorporating feedback; however, they suffer from cold-start issues and often require retraining when workloads shift or schemas change. Recent LLM-based query optimizers leverage pre-trained and fine-tuned LLMs to mitigate these challenges. Nevertheless, they neglect LLMs' in-context learning and execution records as feedback for continuous evolution. In this paper, we present SEFRQO, a Self-Evolving Fine-tuned RAG-based Query Optimizer. SEFRQO mitigates the cold-start problem of LQOs by continuously learning from execution feedback via a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. We employ both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement fine-tuning to prepare the LLM to produce syntactically correct and performance-efficient query hints. Moreover, SEFRQO leverages the LLM's in-context learning capabilities by dynamically constructing prompts with references to similar queries and the historical execution record of the same query. This self-evolving paradigm iteratively optimizes the prompt to minimize query execution latency. Evaluations show that SEFRQO outperforms state-of-the-art LQOs, achieving up to 65.05% and 93.57% reductions in query latency on the CEB and Stack workloads, respectively, compared to PostgreSQL.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at SIGMOD 2026 (https://2026.sigmod.org/)</p></details> |

Despite its widespread use, most RAG pipelines continue to treat retrieval and reasoning as isolated components, retrieving documents once and then generating answers without further interaction. This static design often limits performance on complex tasks that require iterative evidence gathering or high-precision retrieval. Recent work in both the information retrieval (IR) and NLP communities has begun to close this gap by introducing adaptive retrieval and ranking methods that incorporate feedback. In this survey, we present a structured overview of advanced retrieval and ranking mechanisms that integrate such feedback. We categorize feedback signals based on their source and role in improving the query, retrieved context, or document pool. By consolidating these developments, we aim to bridge IR and NLP perspectives and highlight retrieval as a dynamic, learnable component of end-to-end RAG systems.</p></details> | 18 pages, 1 figure |

Simulating Vulnerabilities, and Threats in Multimodal Medical RAG System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17215v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) augmented with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) are increasingly employed in medical AI to enhance factual grounding through external clinical image-text retrieval. However, this reliance creates a significant attack surface. We propose MedThreatRAG, a novel multimodal poisoning framework that systematically probes vulnerabilities in medical RAG systems by injecting adversarial image-text pairs. A key innovation of our approach is the construction of a simulated semi-open attack environment, mimicking real-world medical systems that permit periodic knowledge base updates via user or pipeline contributions. Within this setting, we introduce and emphasize Cross-Modal Conflict Injection (CMCI), which embeds subtle semantic contradictions between medical images and their paired reports. These mismatches degrade retrieval and generation by disrupting cross-modal alignment while remaining sufficiently plausible to evade conventional filters. While basic textual and visual attacks are included for completeness, CMCI demonstrates the most severe degradation. Evaluations on IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR QA tasks show that MedThreatRAG reduces answer F1 scores by up to 27.66% and lowers LLaVA-Med-1.5 F1 rates to as low as 51.36%. Our findings expose fundamental security gaps in clinical RAG systems and highlight the urgent need for threat-aware design and robust multimodal consistency checks. Finally, we conclude with a concise set of guidelines to inform the safe development of future multimodal medical RAG systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sumbi...</summary><p>Sumbitted to 2025 AAAI main track</p></details> |

Large Language Models (LLMs) offer unprecedented analytical opportunities however, their knowledge base is constrained to the models' last training date, rendering these capabilities unusable for organizations whose mission impacts rely on emerging and timely information. This research proposes an innovative approach to supply chain analysis by integrating emerging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) preprocessing and retrieval techniques with advanced web-scraping technologies. Our method aims to reduce latency in incorporating new information into an augmented-LLM, enabling timely analysis of supply chain disruptors. Through experimentation, this study evaluates the combinatorial effects of these techniques towards timeliness and quality trade-offs. Our results suggest that in applying RAG systems to supply chain analysis, fine-tuning the embedding retrieval model consistently provides the most significant performance gains, underscoring the critical importance of retrieval quality. Adaptive iterative retrieval, which dynamically adjusts retrieval depth based on context, further enhances performance, especially on complex supply chain queries. Conversely, fine-tuning the LLM yields limited improvements and higher resource costs, while techniques such as downward query abstraction significantly outperforms upward abstraction in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 5 figures, 1 table.

While RDF/OWL reasoners enable graph-based reasoning, they are limited to fragments of first-order logic, preventing deeper temporal and semantic analysis. This paper addresses both challenges by developing automatic historical event extraction models using multiple LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Llama 3.2) with three enhancement strategies: pure base generation, knowledge graph enhancement, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). We conducted comprehensive evaluations using historical texts from Thucydides. Our findings reveal that enhancement strategies optimize different performance dimensions rather than providing universal improvements. For coverage and historical breadth, base generation achieves optimal performance with Claude and GPT-4 extracting comprehensive events. However, for precision, RAG enhancement improves coordinate accuracy and metadata completeness. Model architecture fundamentally determines enhancement sensitivity: larger models demonstrate robust baseline performance with incremental RAG improvements, while Llama 3.2 shows extreme variance from competitive performance to complete failure. We then developed an automated translation pipeline converting extracted RDF representations into Coq proof assistant specifications, enabling higher-order reasoning beyond RDF capabilities including multi-step causal verification, temporal arithmetic with BC dates, and formal proofs about historical causation. The Coq formalization validates that RAG-discovered event types represent legitimate domain-specific semantic structures rather than ontological violations.</p></details> |  |
| **[GRADE: Generating multi-hop QA and fine-gRAined Difficulty matrix for RAG Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16994v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are widely adopted in knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, but current evaluations often overlook the structural complexity and multi-step reasoning required in real-world scenarios. These benchmarks overlook key factors such as the interaction between retrieval difficulty and reasoning depth. To address this gap, we propose \textsc{GRADE}, a novel evaluation framework that models task difficulty along two orthogonal dimensions: (1) reasoning depth, defined by the number of inference steps (hops), and (2) semantic distance between the query and its supporting evidence. We construct a synthetic multi-hop QA dataset from factual news articles by extracting knowledge graphs and augmenting them through semantic clustering to recover missing links, allowing us to generate diverse and difficulty-controlled queries. Central to our framework is a 2D difficulty matrix that combines generator-side and retriever-side difficulty. Experiments across multiple domains and models show that error rates strongly correlate with our difficulty measures, validating their diagnostic utility. \textsc{GRADE} enables fine-grained analysis of RAG performance and provides a scalable foundation for evaluating and improving multi-hop reasoning in real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 findings</p></details> |
| **[RAGAPHENE: A RAG Annotation Platform with Human Enhancements and Edits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19272v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is an important aspect of conversing with Large Language Models (LLMs) when factually correct information is important. LLMs may provide answers that appear correct, but could contain hallucinated information. Thus, building benchmarks that can evaluate LLMs on multi-turn RAG conversations has become an increasingly important task. Simulating real-world conversations is vital for producing high quality evaluation benchmarks. We present RAGAPHENE, a chat-based annotation platform that enables annotators to simulate real-world conversations for benchmarking and evaluating LLMs. RAGAPHENE has been successfully used by approximately 40 annotators to build thousands of real-world conversations.</p></details> |  |
| **[End-to-End Agentic RAG System Training for Traceable Diagnostic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15746v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate diagnosis with medical large language models is hindered by knowledge gaps and hallucinations. Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help, but their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor feedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce Deep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for medical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical retrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge sources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More crutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its environment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure, and diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from large-scale data through RL. Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches across multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic baselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks for both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and retrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the uniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional implementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight improvements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight into its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more reliable and precise preliminary diagnoses.

| **[Benchmarking Vector, Graph and Hybrid Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipelines for Open Radio Access Networks (ORAN)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03608v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI (GenAI) is expected to play a pivotal role in enabling autonomous optimization in future wireless networks. Within the ORAN architecture, Large Language Models (LLMs) can be specialized to generate xApps and rApps by leveraging specifications and API definitions from the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) platform. However, fine-tuning base LLMs for telecom-specific tasks remains expensive and resource-intensive. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a practical alternative through in-context learning, enabling domain adaptation without full retraining. While traditional RAG systems rely on vector-based retrieval, emerging variants such as GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG incorporate knowledge graphs or dual retrieval strategies to support multi-hop reasoning and improve factual grounding. Despite their promise, these methods lack systematic, metric-driven evaluations, particularly in high-stakes domains such as ORAN. In this study, we conduct a comparative evaluation of Vector RAG, GraphRAG, and Hybrid GraphRAG using ORAN specifications. We assess performance across varying question complexities using established generation metrics: faithfulness, answer relevance, context relevance, and factual correctness. Results show that both GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG outperform traditional RAG. Hybrid GraphRAG improves factual correctness by 8%, while GraphRAG improves context relevance by 11%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Each to Their Own: Exploring the Optimal Embedding in RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17442v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, as Large Language Models (LLMs) have fundamentally impacted various fields, the methods for incorporating up-to-date information into LLMs or adding external knowledge to construct domain-specific models have garnered wide attention. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), serving as an inference-time scaling method, is notable for its low cost and minimal effort for parameter tuning. However, due to heterogeneous training data and model architecture, the variant embedding models used in RAG exhibit different benefits across various areas, often leading to different similarity calculation results and, consequently, varying response quality from LLMs. To address this problem, we propose and examine two approaches to enhance RAG by combining the benefits of multiple embedding models, named Mixture-Embedding RAG and Confident RAG. Mixture-Embedding RAG simply sorts and selects retrievals from multiple embedding models based on standardized similarity; however, it does not outperform vanilla RAG. In contrast, Confident RAG generates responses multiple times using different embedding models and then selects the responses with the highest confidence level, demonstrating average improvements of approximately 10% and 5% over vanilla LLMs and RAG, respectively. The consistent results across different LLMs and embedding models indicate that Confident RAG is an efficient plug-and-play approach for various domains. We will release our code upon publication.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedCoT-RAG: Causal Chain-of-Thought RAG for Medical Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15849v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical question answering but often struggle with hallucinations and shallow reasoning, particularly in tasks requiring nuanced clinical understanding. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers a practical and privacy-preserving way to enhance LLMs with external medical knowledge. However, most existing approaches rely on surface-level semantic retrieval and lack the structured reasoning needed for clinical decision support. We introduce MedCoT-RAG, a domain-specific framework that combines causal-aware document retrieval with structured chain-of-thought prompting tailored to medical workflows. This design enables models to retrieve evidence aligned with diagnostic logic and generate step-by-step causal reasoning reflective of real-world clinical practice. Experiments on three diverse medical QA benchmarks show that MedCoT-RAG outperforms strong baselines by up to 10.3% over vanilla RAG and 6.4% over advanced domain-adapted methods, improving accuracy, interpretability, and consistency in complex medical tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting RAG Ensemble: A Theoretical and Mechanistic Analysis of Multi-RAG System Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13828v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology has been widely applied in recent years. However, despite the emergence of various RAG frameworks, a single RAG framework still cannot adapt well to a broad range of downstream tasks. Therefore, how to leverage the advantages of multiple RAG systems has become an area worth exploring. To address this issue, we have conducted a comprehensive and systematic investigation into ensemble methods based on RAG systems. Specifically, we have analyzed the RAG ensemble framework from both theoretical and mechanistic analysis perspectives. From the theoretical analysis, we provide the first explanation of the RAG ensemble framework from the perspective of information entropy. In terms of mechanism analysis, we have explored the RAG ensemble framework from both the pipeline and module levels. We carefully select four different pipelines (Branching, Iterative, Loop, and Agentic) and three different modules (Generator, Retriever, and Reranker) to solve seven different research questions. The experiments show that aggregating multiple RAG systems is both generalizable and robust, whether at the pipeline level or the module level. Our work lays the foundation for similar research on the multi-RAG system ensemble.</p></details> |  |
| **[GridCodex: A RAG-Driven AI Framework for Power Grid Code Reasoning and Compliance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12682v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The global shift towards renewable energy presents unprecedented challenges for the electricity industry, making regulatory reasoning and compliance increasingly vital. Grid codes, the regulations governing grid operations, are complex and often lack automated interpretation solutions, which hinders industry expansion and undermines profitability for electricity companies. We introduce GridCodex, an end to end framework for grid code reasoning and compliance that leverages large language models and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Our framework advances conventional RAG workflows through multi stage query refinement and enhanced retrieval with RAPTOR. We validate the effectiveness of GridCodex with comprehensive benchmarks, including automated answer assessment across multiple dimensions and regulatory agencies. Experimental results showcase a 26.4% improvement in answer quality and more than a 10 fold increase in recall rate. An ablation study further examines the impact of base model selection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can we Evaluate RAGs with Synthetic Data?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11758v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate whether synthetic question-answer (QA) data generated by large language models (LLMs) can serve as an effective proxy for human-labeled benchmarks when such data is unavailable. We assess the reliability of synthetic benchmarks across two experiments: one varying retriever parameters while keeping the generator fixed, and another varying the generator with fixed retriever parameters. Across four datasets, of which two open-domain and two proprietary, we find that synthetic benchmarks reliably rank the RAGs varying in terms of retriever configuration, aligning well with human-labeled benchmark baselines. However, they fail to produce consistent RAG rankings when comparing generator architectures. The breakdown possibly arises from a combination of task mismatch between the synthetic and human benchmarks, and stylistic bias favoring certain generators.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for the SynDAiTE workshop at the European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML-PKDD 2025), September 15, 2025 - Porto, Portugal</p></details> |
| **[RAG for Geoscience: What We Expect, Gaps and Opportunities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11246v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances language models by combining retrieval with generation. However, its current workflow remains largely text-centric, limiting its applicability in geoscience. Many geoscientific tasks are inherently evidence-hungry. Typical examples involve imputing missing observations using analog scenes, retrieving equations and parameters to calibrate models, geolocating field photos based on visual cues, or surfacing historical case studies to support policy analyses. A simple ``retrieve-then-generate'' pipeline is insufficient for these needs. We envision Geo-RAG, a next-generation paradigm that reimagines RAG as a modular retrieve $\rightarrow$ reason $\rightarrow$ generate $\rightarrow$ verify loop. Geo-RAG supports four core capabilities: (i) retrieval of multi-modal Earth data; (ii) reasoning under physical and domain constraints; (iii) generation of science-grade artifacts; and (iv) verification of generated hypotheses against numerical models, ground measurements, and expert assessments. This shift opens new opportunities for more trustworthy and transparent geoscience workflows.</p></details> |  |

The focus is on developing an automated feedback tool that evaluates student code for adherence to key object-oriented design principles, addressing the need for more effective and scalable methods to teach software design best practices. The innovative practice involves leveraging LLMs and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to create an automated feedback system that assesses student code for principles like SOLID, DRY, and design patterns. It analyzes the effectiveness of various prompting strategies and the RAG integration. Preliminary findings show promising improvements in code quality.

| **[ComoRAG: A Cognitive-Inspired Memory-Organized RAG for Stateful Long Narrative Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10419v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Narrative comprehension on long stories and novels has been a challenging domain attributed to their intricate plotlines and entangled, often evolving relations among characters and entities. Given the LLM's diminished reasoning over extended context and high computational cost, retrieval-based approaches remain a pivotal role in practice. However, traditional RAG methods can fall short due to their stateless, single-step retrieval process, which often overlooks the dynamic nature of capturing interconnected relations within long-range context. In this work, we propose ComoRAG, holding the principle that narrative reasoning is not a one-shot process, but a dynamic, evolving interplay between new evidence acquisition and past knowledge consolidation, analogous to human cognition when reasoning with memory-related signals in the brain. Specifically, when encountering a reasoning impasse, ComoRAG undergoes iterative reasoning cycles while interacting with a dynamic memory workspace. In each cycle, it generates probing queries to devise new exploratory paths, then integrates the retrieved evidence of new aspects into a global memory pool, thereby supporting the emergence of a coherent context for the query resolution. Across four challenging long-context narrative benchmarks (200K+ tokens), ComoRAG outperforms strong RAG baselines with consistent relative gains up to 11% compared to the strongest baseline. Further analysis reveals that ComoRAG is particularly advantageous for complex queries requiring global comprehension, offering a principled, cognitively motivated paradigm for retrieval-based long context comprehension towards stateful reasoning.

Within financial sectors, modern enterprises increasingly rely on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to address complex compliance requirements in financial document workflows. However, existing solutions struggle to account for the inherent heterogeneity of data (e.g., text, tables, diagrams) and evolving nature of regulatory standards used in financial filings, leading to compromised accuracy in critical information extraction. We propose the FinSage framework as a solution, utilizing a multi-aspect RAG framework tailored for regulatory compliance analysis in multi-modal financial documents. FinSage introduces three innovative components: (1) a multi-modal pre-processing pipeline that unifies diverse data formats and generates chunk-level metadata summaries, (2) a multi-path sparse-dense retrieval system augmented with query expansion (HyDE) and metadata-aware semantic search, and (3) a domain-specialized re-ranking module fine-tuned via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to prioritize compliance-critical content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FinSage achieves an impressive recall of 92.51% on 75 expert-curated questions derived from surpasses the best baseline method on the FinanceBench question answering datasets by 24.06% in accuracy. Moreover, FinSage has been successfully deployed as financial question-answering agent in online meetings, where it has already served more than 1,200 people.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 34th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM2025)</p></details> |
| **[SMA: Who Said That? Auditing Membership Leakage in Semi-Black-box RAG Controlling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09105v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and its Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) significantly improve the knowledge coverage and contextual understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) by introducing external knowledge sources. However, retrieval and multimodal fusion obscure content provenance, rendering existing membership inference methods unable to reliably attribute generated outputs to pre-training, external retrieval, or user input, thus undermining privacy leakage accountability To address these challenges, we propose the first Source-aware Membership Audit (SMA) that enables fine-grained source attribution of generated content in a semi-black-box setting with retrieval control capabilities. To address the environmental constraints of semi-black-box auditing, we further design an attribution estimation mechanism based on zero-order optimization, which robustly approximates the true influence of input tokens on the output through large-scale perturbation sampling and ridge regression modeling. In addition, SMA introduces a cross-modal attribution technique that projects image inputs into textual descriptions via MLLMs, enabling token-level attribution in the text modality, which for the first time facilitates membership inference on image retrieval traces in MRAG systems. This work shifts the focus of membership inference from 'whether the data has been memorized' to 'where the content is sourced from', offering a novel perspective for auditing data provenance in complex generative systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[VulScribeR: Exploring RAG-based Vulnerability Augmentation with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04125v4)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting vulnerabilities is vital for software security, yet deep learning-based vulnerability detectors (DLVD) face a data shortage, which limits their effectiveness. Data augmentation can potentially alleviate the data shortage, but augmenting vulnerable code is challenging and requires a generative solution that maintains vulnerability. Previous works have only focused on generating samples that contain single statements or specific types of vulnerabilities. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to solve various code generation and comprehension tasks with inspiring results, especially when fused with retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Therefore, we propose VulScribeR, a novel LLM-based solution that leverages carefully curated prompt templates to augment vulnerable datasets. More specifically, we explore three strategies to augment both single and multi-statement vulnerabilities, with LLMs, namely Mutation, Injection, and Extension. Our extensive evaluation across four vulnerability datasets and DLVD models, using three LLMs, show that our approach beats two SOTA methods Vulgen and VGX, and Random Oversampling (ROS) by 27.48%, 27.93%, and 15.41% in f1-score with 5K generated vulnerable samples on average, and 53.84%, 54.10%, 69.90%, and 40.93% with 15K generated vulnerable samples. Our approach demonstrates its feasibility for large-scale data augmentation by generating 1K samples at as cheap as US$ 1.88.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TOSEM; 26 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables, 3 prompt templates, 1 algorithm</p></details> |

These systems face challenges in understanding and generating authentic Cantonese colloquial expressions due to limited annotated data and linguistic variability. The review evaluates the integration of LoRA within RAG frameworks, benchmarks PEFT methods for retrieval and generation accuracy, identify domain adaptation strategies under limited data, and compares fine-tuning techniques aimed at improving semantic fidelity under data-scarce conditions. A systematic analysis of recent studies employing diverse LoRA variants, synthetic data generation, user feedback integration, and adaptive parameter allocation was conducted to assess their impact on computational efficiency, retrieval precision, linguistic authenticity, and scalability. Findings reveal that dynamic and ensemble LoRA adaptations significantly reduce trainable parameters without sacrificing retrieval accuracy and generation quality in dialectal contexts. However, limitations remain in fully preserving fine-grained linguistic nuances, especially for low-resource settings like Cantonese. The integration of real-time user feedback and domain-specific data remains underdeveloped, limiting model adaptability and personalization. While selective parameter freezing and nonlinear adaptation methods offer better trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy, their robustness at scale remains an open challenge. This review highlights the promise of PEFT-enhanced RAG systems for domain-specific language tasks and calls for future work targeting dialectal authenticity, dynamic adaptation, and scalable fine-tuning pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 1 figure, 8 tables</p></details> |

These limitations manifest as two key challenges: pervasive misinformation in the web environment, which introduces unreliable or misleading content that can degrade retrieval accuracy, and the underutilization of web tools, which, if effectively employed, could enhance query precision and help mitigate this noise, ultimately improving the retrieval results in RAG systems. To address these issues, we propose WebFilter, a novel RAG framework that generates source-restricted queries and filters out unreliable content. This approach combines a retrieval filtering mechanism with a behavior- and outcome-driven reward strategy, optimizing both query formulation and retrieval outcomes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WebFilter improves answer quality and retrieval precision, outperforming existing RAG methods on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, user understanding, practices and expectations regarding these memory systems are not yet well understood. This paper presents a thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with 18 users to explore their mental models of LLM's Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)-based memory, current usage practices, perceived benefits and drawbacks, privacy concerns and expectations for future memory systems. Our findings reveal diverse and often incomplete mental models of how memory operates. While users appreciate the potential for enhanced personalization and efficiency, significant concerns exist regarding privacy, control and the accuracy of remembered information. Users express a desire for granular control over memory generation, management, usage and updating, including clear mechanisms for reviewing, editing, deleting and categorizing memories, as well as transparent insight into how memories and inferred information are used. We discuss design implications for creating more user-centric, transparent, and trustworthy LLM memory systems.</p></details> |  |

| **[PrLM: Learning Explicit Reasoning for Personalized RAG via Contrastive Reward Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07342v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) aims to produce user-tailored responses by incorporating retrieved user profiles alongside the input query. Existing methods primarily focus on improving retrieval and rely on large language models (LLMs) to implicitly integrate the retrieved context with the query. However, such models are often sensitive to retrieval quality and may generate responses that are misaligned with user preferences. To address this limitation, we propose PrLM, a reinforcement learning framework that trains LLMs to explicitly reason over retrieved user profiles. Guided by a contrastively trained personalization reward model, PrLM effectively learns from user responses without requiring annotated reasoning paths. Experiments on three personalized text generation datasets show that PrLM outperforms existing methods and remains robust across varying numbers of retrieved profiles and different retrievers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Classification is a RAG problem: A case study on hate speech detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06204v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust content moderation requires classification systems that can quickly adapt to evolving policies without costly retraining. We present classification using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which shifts traditional classification tasks from determining the correct category in accordance with pre-trained parameters to evaluating content in relation to contextual knowledge retrieved at inference. In hate speech detection, this transforms the task from "is this hate speech?" to "does this violate the hate speech policy?" Our Contextual Policy Engine (CPE) - an agentic RAG system - demonstrates this approach and offers three key advantages: (1) robust classification accuracy comparable to leading commercial systems, (2) inherent explainability via retrieved policy segments, and (3) dynamic policy updates without model retraining. Through three experiments, we demonstrate strong baseline performance and show that the system can apply fine-grained policy control by correctly adjusting protection for specific identity groups without requiring retraining or compromising overall performance. These findings establish that RAG can transform classification into a more flexible, transparent, and adaptable process for content moderation and wider classification problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[You Don't Need Pre-built Graphs for RAG: Retrieval Augmented Generation with Adaptive Reasoning Structures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06105v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often suffer from hallucination, generating factually incorrect statements when handling questions beyond their knowledge and perception. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this by retrieving query-relevant contexts from knowledge bases to support LLM reasoning. Recent advances leverage pre-constructed graphs to capture the relational connections among distributed documents, showing remarkable performance in complex tasks. However, existing Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) methods rely on a costly process to transform the corpus into a graph, introducing overwhelming token cost and update latency. Moreover, real-world queries vary in type and complexity, requiring different logic structures for accurate reasoning. The pre-built graph may not align with these required structures, resulting in ineffective knowledge retrieval. To this end, we propose a \textbf{\underline{Logic}}-aware \textbf{\underline{R}}etrieval-\textbf{\underline{A}}ugmented \textbf{\underline{G}}eneration framework (\textbf{LogicRAG}) that dynamically extracts reasoning structures at inference time to guide adaptive retrieval without any pre-built graph. LogicRAG begins by decomposing the input query into a set of subproblems and constructing a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to model the logical dependencies among them. To support coherent multi-step reasoning, LogicRAG then linearizes the graph using topological sort, so that subproblems can be addressed in a logically consistent order. Besides, LogicRAG applies graph pruning to reduce redundant retrieval and uses context pruning to filter irrelevant context, significantly reducing the overall token cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LogicRAG achieves both superior performance and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

While GraphRAG has shown promise for multi-hop reasoning and structured retrieval, its adoption has been limited by the high computational cost of constructing knowledge graphs using large language models (LLMs) and the latency of graph-based retrieval. To address these challenges, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a dependency-based knowledge graph construction pipeline that leverages industrial-grade NLP libraries to extract entities and relations from unstructured text completely eliminating reliance on LLMs; and (2) a lightweight graph retrieval strategy that combines hybrid query node identification with efficient one-hop traversal for high-recall, low-latency subgraph extraction. We evaluate our framework on two SAP datasets focused on legacy code migration and demonstrate strong empirical performance. Our system achieves up to 15% and 4.35% improvements over traditional RAG baselines based on LLM-as-Judge and RAGAS metrics, respectively. Moreover, our dependency-based construction approach attains 94% of the performance of LLM-generated knowledge graphs (61.87% vs. 65.83%) while significantly reducing cost and improving scalability. These results validate the feasibility of deploying GraphRAG systems in real-world, large-scale enterprise applications without incurring prohibitive resource requirements paving the way for practical, explainable, and domain-adaptable retrieval-augmented reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[RankArena: A Unified Platform for Evaluating Retrieval, Reranking and RAG with Human and LLM Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05512v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating the quality of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and document reranking systems remains challenging due to the lack of scalable, user-centric, and multi-perspective evaluation tools. We introduce RankArena, a unified platform for comparing and analysing the performance of retrieval pipelines, rerankers, and RAG systems using structured human and LLM-based feedback as well as for collecting such feedback. RankArena supports multiple evaluation modes: direct reranking visualisation, blind pairwise comparisons with human or LLM voting, supervised manual document annotation, and end-to-end RAG answer quality assessment. It captures fine-grained relevance feedback through both pairwise preferences and full-list annotations, along with auxiliary metadata such as movement metrics, annotation time, and quality ratings. The platform also integrates LLM-as-a-judge evaluation, enabling comparison between model-generated rankings and human ground truth annotations. All interactions are stored as structured evaluation datasets that can be used to train rerankers, reward models, judgment agents, or retrieval strategy selectors. Our platform is publicly available at https://rankarena.ngrok.io/, and the Demo video is provided https://youtu.be/jIYAP4PaSSI.</p></details> | Accept at CIKM 2025 |
| **[mKG-RAG: Multimodal Knowledge Graph-Enhanced RAG for Visual Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05318v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been proposed to expand internal knowledge of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating external knowledge databases into the generation process, which is widely used for knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. Despite impressive advancements, vanilla RAG-based VQA methods that rely on unstructured documents and overlook the structural relationships among knowledge elements frequently introduce irrelevant or misleading content, reducing answer accuracy and reliability. To overcome these challenges, a promising solution is to integrate multimodal knowledge graphs (KGs) into RAG-based VQA frameworks to enhance the generation by introducing structured multimodal knowledge. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel multimodal knowledge-augmented generation framework (mKG-RAG) based on multimodal KGs for knowledge-intensive VQA tasks. Specifically, our approach leverages MLLM-powered keyword extraction and vision-text matching to distill semantically consistent and modality-aligned entities/relationships from multimodal documents, constructing high-quality multimodal KGs as structured knowledge representations. In addition, a dual-stage retrieval strategy equipped with a question-aware multimodal retriever is introduced to improve retrieval efficiency while refining precision. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for knowledge-based VQA.</p></details> |  |
| **[QA-Dragon: Query-Aware Dynamic RAG System for Knowledge-Intensive Visual Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05197v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been introduced to mitigate hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating external knowledge into the generation process, and it has become a widely adopted approach for knowledge-intensive Visual Question Answering (VQA). However, existing RAG methods typically retrieve from either text or images in isolation, limiting their ability to address complex queries that require multi-hop reasoning or up-to-date factual knowledge. To address this limitation, we propose QA-Dragon, a Query-Aware Dynamic RAG System for Knowledge-Intensive VQA. Specifically, QA-Dragon introduces a domain router to identify the query's subject domain for domain-specific reasoning, along with a search router that dynamically selects optimal retrieval strategies. By orchestrating both text and image search agents in a hybrid setup, our system supports multimodal, multi-turn, and multi-hop reasoning, enabling it to tackle complex VQA tasks effectively. We evaluate our QA-Dragon on the Meta CRAG-MM Challenge at KDD Cup 2025, where it significantly enhances the reasoning performance of base models under challenging scenarios. Our framework achieves substantial improvements in both answer accuracy and knowledge overlap scores, outperforming baselines by 5.06% on the single-source task, 6.35% on the multi-source task, and 5.03% on the multi-turn task.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The source code for our system is released in https://github.com/jzzzzh/QA-Dragon</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal RAG Enhanced Visual Description](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09170v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Textual descriptions for multimodal inputs entail recurrent refinement of queries to produce relevant output images. Despite efforts to address challenges such as scaling model size and data volume, the cost associated with pre-training and fine-tuning remains substantial. However, pre-trained large multimodal models (LMMs) encounter a modality gap, characterised by a misalignment between textual and visual representations within a common embedding space. Although fine-tuning can potentially mitigate this gap, it is typically expensive and impractical due to the requirement for extensive domain-driven data. To overcome this challenge, we propose a lightweight training-free approach utilising Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to extend across the modality using a linear mapping, which can be computed efficiently. During inference, this mapping is applied to images embedded by an LMM enabling retrieval of closest textual descriptions from the training set. These textual descriptions, in conjunction with an instruction, cater as an input prompt for the language model to generate new textual descriptions. In addition, we introduce an iterative technique for distilling the mapping by generating synthetic descriptions via the language model facilitating optimisation for standard utilised image description measures. Experimental results on two benchmark multimodal datasets demonstrate significant improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM CIKM 2025. 5 pages, 2 figures</p></details> |
| **[PAIRS: Parametric-Verified Adaptive Information Retrieval and Selection for Efficient RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04057v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a cornerstone technique for enhancing large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. However, current RAG systems face two critical limitations: (1) they inefficiently retrieve information for every query, including simple questions that could be resolved using the LLM's parametric knowledge alone, and (2) they risk retrieving irrelevant documents when queries contain sparse information signals. To address these gaps, we introduce Parametric-verified Adaptive Information Retrieval and Selection (PAIRS), a training-free framework that integrates parametric and retrieved knowledge to adaptively determine whether to retrieve and how to select external information. Specifically, PAIRS employs a dual-path generation mechanism: First, the LLM produces both a direct answer and a context-augmented answer using self-generated pseudo-context. When these outputs converge, PAIRS bypasses external retrieval entirely, dramatically improving the RAG system's efficiency. For divergent cases, PAIRS activates a dual-path retrieval (DPR) process guided by both the original query and self-generated contextual signals, followed by an Adaptive Information Selection (AIS) module that filters documents through weighted similarity to both sources. This simple yet effective approach can not only enhance efficiency by eliminating unnecessary retrievals but also improve accuracy through contextually guided retrieval and adaptive information selection. Experimental results on six question-answering (QA) benchmarks show that PAIRS reduces retrieval costs by around 25% (triggering for only 75% of queries) while still improving accuracy-achieving +1.1% EM and +1.0% F1 over prior baselines on average.</p></details> |  |
| **[MetaGen Blended RAG: Unlocking Zero-Shot Precision for Specialized Domain Question-Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18247v3)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) struggles with domain-specific enterprise datasets, often isolated behind firewalls and rich in complex, specialized terminology unseen by LLMs during pre-training. Semantic variability across domains like medicine, networking, or law hampers RAG's context precision, while fine-tuning solutions are costly, slow, and lack generalization as new data emerges. Achieving zero-shot precision with retrievers without fine-tuning still remains a key challenge. We introduce 'MetaGen Blended RAG', a novel enterprise search approach that enhances semantic retrievers through a metadata generation pipeline and hybrid query indexes using dense and sparse vectors. By leveraging key concepts, topics, and acronyms, our method creates metadata-enriched semantic indexes and boosted hybrid queries, delivering robust, scalable performance without fine-tuning. On the biomedical PubMedQA dataset, MetaGen Blended RAG achieves 82% retrieval accuracy and 77% RAG accuracy, surpassing all prior zero-shot RAG benchmarks and even rivaling fine-tuned models on that dataset, while also excelling on datasets like SQuAD and NQ. This approach redefines enterprise search using a new approach to building semantic retrievers with unmatched generalization across specialized domains.</p></details> |  |

Our fact-checking system is a simple two-step RAG pipeline based on our last year's submission. We show how the pipeline can be redeployed on-premise, achieving state-of-the-art fact-checking performance (in sense of Ev2R test-score), even under the constraint of a single NVidia A10 GPU, 23GB of graphical memory and 60s running time per claim.</p></details> |  |
| **[Token-Level Precise Attack on RAG: Searching for the Best Alternatives to Mislead Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03110v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in providing trustworthy responses for knowledge-intensive tasks, they still face critical limitations such as hallucinations and outdated knowledge. To address these issues, the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework enhances LLMs with access to external knowledge via a retriever, enabling more accurate and real-time outputs about the latest events. However, this integration brings new security vulnerabilities: the risk that malicious content in the external database can be retrieved and used to manipulate model outputs. Although prior work has explored attacks on RAG systems, existing approaches either rely heavily on access to the retriever or fail to jointly consider both retrieval and generation stages, limiting their effectiveness, particularly in black-box scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose Token-level Precise Attack on the RAG (TPARAG), a novel framework that targets both white-box and black-box RAG systems. TPARAG leverages a lightweight white-box LLM as an attacker to generate and iteratively optimize malicious passages at the token level, ensuring both retrievability and high attack success in generation. Extensive experiments on open-domain QA datasets demonstrate that TPARAG consistently outperforms previous approaches in retrieval-stage and end-to-end attack effectiveness. These results further reveal critical vulnerabilities in RAG pipelines and offer new insights into improving their robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Multi-Round Diagnostic RAG Framework for Emulating Clinical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07724v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, accurately and quickly deploying medical large language models (LLMs) has become a trend. Among these, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has garnered attention due to rapid deployment and privacy protection. However, the challenge hinder the practical deployment of RAG for medical diagnosis: the semantic gap between colloquial patient descriptions and the professional terminology within medical knowledge bases. We try to address the challenge from the data perspective and the method perspective. First, to address the semantic gap in existing knowledge bases, we construct DiagnosGraph, a generalist knowledge graph covering both modern medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine. It contains 876 common diseases with the graph of 7,997 nodes and 37,201 triples. To bridge the gap between colloquial patient narratives and academic medical knowledge, DiagnosGraph also introduces $1,908$ medical record by formalizing the patient chief complaint and proposing a medical diagnosis. Second, we introduce the Multi-Round Diagnostic RAG (MRD-RAG) framework. It utilizes a multi-round dialogue to refine diagnostic possibilities, emulating the clinical reasoning of a physician. Experiments conducted on four medical benchmarks, with evaluations by human physicians, demonstrate that MRD-RAG enhances the diagnostic performance of LLMs, highlighting its potential to make automated diagnosis more accurate and human-aligned.</p></details> |  |
| **[Highlight & Summarize: RAG without the jailbreaks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02872v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preventing jailbreaking and model hijacking of Large Language Models (LLMs) is an important yet challenging task. For example, when interacting with a chatbot, malicious users can input specially crafted prompts to cause the LLM to generate undesirable content or perform a completely different task from its intended purpose. Existing mitigations for such attacks typically rely on hardening the LLM's system prompt or using a content classifier trained to detect undesirable content or off-topic conversations. However, these probabilistic approaches are relatively easy to bypass due to the very large space of possible inputs and undesirable outputs. In this paper, we present and evaluate Highlight & Summarize (H&S), a new design pattern for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that prevents these attacks by design. The core idea is to perform the same task as a standard RAG pipeline (i.e., to provide natural language answers to questions, based on relevant sources) without ever revealing the user's question to the generative LLM. This is achieved by splitting the pipeline into two components: a highlighter, which takes the user's question and extracts relevant passages ("highlights") from the retrieved documents, and a summarizer, which takes the highlighted passages and summarizes them into a cohesive answer. We describe several possible instantiations of H&S and evaluate their generated responses in terms of correctness, relevance, and response quality. Surprisingly, when using an LLM-based highlighter, the majority of H&S responses are judged to be better than those of a standard RAG pipeline.</p></details> |  |
| **[Meta-RAG on Large Codebases Using Code Summarization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02611v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) systems have been at the forefront of applied Artificial Intelligence (AI) research in a multitude of domains. One such domain is software development, where researchers have pushed the automation of a number of code tasks through LLM agents. Software development is a complex ecosystem, that stretches far beyond code implementation and well into the realm of code maintenance. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent system to localize bugs in large pre-existing codebases using information retrieval and LLMs. Our system introduces a novel Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, Meta-RAG, where we utilize summaries to condense codebases by an average of 79.8\%, into a compact, structured, natural language representation. We then use an LLM agent to determine which parts of the codebase are critical for bug resolution, i.e. bug localization. We demonstrate the usefulness of Meta-RAG through evaluation with the SWE-bench Lite dataset. Meta-RAG scores 84.67 % and 53.0 % for file-level and function-level correct localization rates, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simple Methods Defend RAG Systems Well Against Real-World Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02296v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring safety and in-domain responses for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems is paramount in safety-critical applications, yet remains a significant challenge. To address this, we evaluate four methodologies for Out-Of-Domain (OOD) query detection: GPT-4o, regression-based, Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-based, and Neural Collapse (NC), to ensure the RAG system only responds to queries confined to the system's knowledge base. Specifically, our evaluation explores two novel dimensionality reduction and feature separation strategies: \textit{PCA}, where top components are selected using explained variance or OOD separability, and an adaptation of \textit{Neural Collapse Feature Separation}. We validate our approach on standard datasets (StackExchange and MSMARCO) and real-world applications (Substance Use and COVID-19), including tests against LLM-simulated and actual attacks on a COVID-19 vaccine chatbot. Through human and LLM-based evaluations of response correctness and relevance, we confirm that an external OOD detector is crucial for maintaining response relevance.</p></details> |  |
