| **[VIKI-R: Coordinating Embodied Multi-Agent Cooperation via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09049v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coordinating multiple embodied agents in dynamic environments remains a core challenge in artificial intelligence, requiring both perception-driven reasoning and scalable cooperation strategies. While recent works have leveraged large language models (LLMs) for multi-agent planning, a few have begun to explore vision-language models (VLMs) for visual reasoning. However, these VLM-based approaches remain limited in their support for diverse embodiment types. In this work, we introduce VIKI-Bench, the first hierarchical benchmark tailored for embodied multi-agent cooperation, featuring three structured levels: agent activation, task planning, and trajectory perception. VIKI-Bench includes diverse robot embodiments, multi-view visual observations, and structured supervision signals to evaluate reasoning grounded in visual inputs. To demonstrate the utility of VIKI-Bench, we propose VIKI-R, a two-stage framework that fine-tunes a pretrained vision-language model (VLM) using Chain-of-Thought annotated demonstrations, followed by reinforcement learning under multi-level reward signals. Our extensive experiments show that VIKI-R significantly outperforms baselines method across all task levels. Furthermore, we show that reinforcement learning enables the emergence of compositional cooperation patterns among heterogeneous agents. Together, VIKI-Bench and VIKI-R offer a unified testbed and method for advancing multi-agent, visual-driven cooperation in embodied AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://faceong.github.io/VIKI-R/</p></details> |
| **[Agentic Neural Networks: Self-Evolving Multi-Agent Systems via Textual Backpropagation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09046v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging multiple Large Language Models(LLMs) has proven effective for addressing complex, high-dimensional tasks, but current approaches often rely on static, manually engineered multi-agent configurations. To overcome these constraints, we present the Agentic Neural Network(ANN), a framework that conceptualizes multi-agent collaboration as a layered neural network architecture. In this design, each agent operates as a node, and each layer forms a cooperative "team" focused on a specific subtask. Agentic Neural Network follows a two-phase optimization strategy: (1) Forward Phase-Drawing inspiration from neural network forward passes, tasks are dynamically decomposed into subtasks, and cooperative agent teams with suitable aggregation methods are constructed layer by layer. (2) Backward Phase-Mirroring backpropagation, we refine both global and local collaboration through iterative feedback, allowing agents to self-evolve their roles, prompts, and coordination. This neuro-symbolic approach enables ANN to create new or specialized agent teams post-training, delivering notable gains in accuracy and adaptability. Across four benchmark datasets, ANN surpasses leading multi-agent baselines under the same configurations, showing consistent performance improvements. Our findings indicate that ANN provides a scalable, data-driven framework for multi-agent systems, combining the collaborative capabilities of LLMs with the efficiency and flexibility of neural network principles. We plan to open-source the entire framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[AbstentionBench: Reasoning LLMs Fail on Unanswerable Questions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09038v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For Large Language Models (LLMs) to be reliably deployed in both everyday and high-stakes domains, knowing when not to answer is equally critical as answering correctly. Real-world user queries, which can be underspecified, ill-posed, or fundamentally unanswerable, require LLMs to reason about uncertainty and selectively abstain -- i.e., refuse to answer definitively. However, abstention remains understudied, without a systematic evaluation framework for modern LLMs. In this work, we introduce AbstentionBench, a large-scale benchmark for holistically evaluating abstention across 20 diverse datasets, including questions with unknown answers, underspecification, false premises, subjective interpretations, and outdated information. Evaluating 20 frontier LLMs reveals abstention is an unsolved problem, and one where scaling models is of little use. While recent reasoning LLMs have shown impressive results in complex problem solving, surprisingly, we find that reasoning fine-tuning degrades abstention (by $24\%$ on average), even for math and science domains on which reasoning models are explicitly trained. We find that while a carefully crafted system prompt can boost abstention in practice, it does not resolve models' fundamental inability to reason about uncertainty. We release AbstentionBench to foster research into advancing LLM reliability.</p></details> |  |
| **[FZOO: Fast Zeroth-Order Optimizer for Fine-Tuning Large Language Models towards Adam-Scale Speed](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09034v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) often faces GPU memory bottlenecks: the backward pass of first-order optimizers like Adam increases memory usage to more than 10 times the inference level (e.g., 633 GB for OPT-30B). Zeroth-order (ZO) optimizers avoid this cost by estimating gradients only from forward passes, yet existing methods like MeZO usually require many more steps to converge. Can this trade-off between speed and memory in ZO be fundamentally improved? Normalized-SGD demonstrates strong empirical performance with greater memory efficiency than Adam. In light of this, we introduce FZOO, a Fast Zeroth-Order Optimizer toward Adam-Scale Speed. FZOO reduces the total forward passes needed for convergence by employing batched one-sided estimates that adapt step sizes based on the standard deviation of batch losses. It also accelerates per-batch computation through the use of Rademacher random vector perturbations coupled with CUDA's parallel processing. Extensive experiments on diverse models, including RoBERTa-large, OPT (350M-66B), Phi-2, and Llama3, across 11 tasks validate FZOO's effectiveness. On average, FZOO outperforms MeZO by 3 percent in accuracy while requiring 3 times fewer forward passes. For RoBERTa-large, FZOO achieves average improvements of 5.6 percent in accuracy and an 18 times reduction in forward passes compared to MeZO, achieving convergence speeds comparable to Adam. We also provide theoretical analysis proving FZOO's formal equivalence to a normalized-SGD update rule and its convergence guarantees. FZOO integrates smoothly into PEFT techniques, enabling even larger memory savings. Overall, our results make single-GPU, high-speed, full-parameter fine-tuning practical and point toward future work on memory-efficient pre-training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Router-R1: Teaching LLMs Multi-Round Routing and Aggregation via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09033v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid emergence of diverse large language models (LLMs) has spurred the development of LLM routers that assign user queries to the most suitable model. However, existing LLM routers typically perform a single-round, one-to-one mapping (\textit{i.e.}, assigning each query to a single model in isolation), which limits their capability to tackle complex tasks that demand the complementary strengths of multiple LLMs. In this paper, we present \textbf{Router-R1}, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework that formulates multi-LLM routing and aggregation as a sequential decision process. Router-R1 instantiates the router itself as a capable LLM, leveraging its reasoning ability to interleave "think" actions (internal deliberation) with "route" actions (dynamic model invocation), and integrates each response into its evolving context. To guide learning, we employ a lightweight rule-based reward comprising format rewards, final outcome rewards, and a novel cost reward for performance and cost trade-off optimization, opening a pathway toward optimizing performance-cost tradeoffs via RL. Router-R1 also conditions only on simple model descriptors such as pricing, latency, and example performance, enabling strong generalization to unseen model selection. Experiments on seven general and multi-hop QA benchmarks show that Router-R1 outperforms over several strong baselines, achieving superior performance while maintaining robust generalization and cost management.Code is available at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/Router-R1.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/Router-R1</p></details> |
| **[SpatialReasoner: Towards Explicit and Generalizable 3D Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20024v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances on multi-modal models, 3D spatial reasoning remains a challenging task for state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary models. Recent studies explore data-driven approaches and achieve enhanced spatial reasoning performance by fine-tuning models on 3D-related visual question-answering data. However, these methods typically perform spatial reasoning in an implicit manner and often fail on questions that are trivial to humans, even with long chain-of-thought reasoning. In this work, we introduce SpatialReasoner, a novel large vision-language model (LVLM) that addresses 3D spatial reasoning with explicit 3D representations shared between multiple stages--3D perception, computation, and reasoning. Explicit 3D representations provide a coherent interface that supports advanced 3D spatial reasoning and improves the generalization ability to novel question types. Furthermore, by analyzing the explicit 3D representations in multi-step reasoning traces of SpatialReasoner, we study the factual errors and identify key shortcomings of current LVLMs. Results show that our SpatialReasoner achieves improved performance on a variety of spatial reasoning benchmarks, outperforming Gemini 2.0 by 9.2% on 3DSRBench, and generalizes better when evaluating on novel 3D spatial reasoning questions. Our study bridges the 3D parsing capabilities of prior visual foundation models with the powerful reasoning abilities of large language models, opening new directions for 3D spatial reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://spatial-reasoner.github.io</p></details> |
| **[High-Throughput Phenotyping of Clinical Text Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01214v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-throughput phenotyping automates the mapping of patient signs to standardized ontology concepts and is essential for precision medicine. This study evaluates the automation of phenotyping of clinical summaries from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database using large language models. Due to their rich phenotype data, these summaries can be surrogates for physician notes. We conduct a performance comparison of GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-Turbo. Our results indicate that GPT-4 surpasses GPT-3.5-Turbo in identifying, categorizing, and normalizing signs, achieving concordance with manual annotators comparable to inter-rater agreement. Despite some limitations in sign normalization, the extensive pre-training of GPT-4 results in high performance and generalizability across several phenotyping tasks while obviating the need for manually annotated training data. Large language models are expected to be the dominant method for automating high-throughput phenotyping of clinical text.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE-EMBS International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics, Houston TX</p></details> |
| **[SPEED-RL: Faster Training of Reasoning Models via Online Curriculum Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09016v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training large language models with reinforcement learning (RL) against verifiable rewards significantly enhances their reasoning abilities, yet remains computationally expensive due to inefficient uniform prompt sampling. We introduce Selective Prompting with Efficient Estimation of Difficulty (SPEED), an adaptive online RL curriculum that selectively chooses training examples of intermediate difficulty to maximize learning efficiency. Theoretically, we establish that intermediate-difficulty prompts improve the gradient estimator's signal-to-noise ratio, accelerating convergence. Empirically, our efficient implementation leads to 2x to 6x faster training without degrading accuracy, requires no manual tuning, and integrates seamlessly into standard RL algorithms.</p></details> | pre-print |
| **[Learning to Reason Across Parallel Samples for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09014v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling test-time compute brings substantial performance gains for large language models (LLMs). By sampling multiple answers and heuristically aggregate their answers (e.g., either through majority voting or using verifiers to rank the answers), one can achieve consistent performance gains in math domains. In this paper, we propose a new way to leverage such multiple sample set. We train a compact LLM, called Sample Set Aggregator (SSA), that takes a concatenated sequence of multiple samples and output the final answer, optimizing it for the answer accuracy with reinforcement learning. Experiments on multiple reasoning datasets show that SSA outperforms other test-time scaling methods such as reward model-based re-ranking. Our approach also shows a promising generalization ability, across sample set sizes, base model families and scales, and tasks. By separating LLMs to generate answers and LLMs to analyze and aggregate sampled answers, our approach can work with the outputs from premier black box models easily and efficiently.</p></details> |  |
| **[Activation Approximations Can Incur Safety Vulnerabilities Even in Aligned LLMs: Comprehensive Analysis and Defense](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00840v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable capabilities across various domains. Accompanying the evolving capabilities and expanding deployment scenarios of LLMs, their deployment challenges escalate due to their sheer scale and the advanced yet complex activation designs prevalent in notable model series, such as Llama, Gemma, Mistral. These challenges have become particularly pronounced in resource-constrained deployment scenarios, where mitigating inference bottlenecks is imperative. Among various recent efforts, activation approximation has emerged as a promising avenue for pursuing inference efficiency, sometimes considered indispensable in applications such as private inference. Despite achieving substantial speedups with minimal impact on utility, even appearing sound and practical for real-world deployment, the safety implications of activation approximations remain unclear. In this work, we fill this critical gap in LLM safety by conducting the first systematic safety evaluation of activation approximations. Our safety vetting spans seven state-of-the-art techniques across three popular categories (activation polynomialization, activation sparsification, and activation quantization), revealing consistent safety degradation across ten safety-aligned LLMs. To overcome the hurdle of devising a unified defense accounting for diverse activation approximation methods, we perform an in-depth analysis of their shared error patterns and uncover three key findings. We propose QuadA, a novel safety enhancement method tailored to mitigate the safety compromises introduced by activation approximations. Extensive experiments and ablation studies corroborate QuadA's effectiveness in enhancing the safety capabilities of LLMs after activation approximations.</p></details> | 20 pages |
| **[Towards Reliable Proof Generation with LLMs: A Neuro-Symbolic Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14479v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) struggle with formal domains that require rigorous logical deduction and symbolic reasoning, such as mathematical proof generation. We propose a neuro-symbolic approach that combines LLMs' generative strengths with structured components to overcome this challenge. As a proof-of-concept, we focus on geometry problems. Our approach is two-fold: (1) we retrieve analogous problems and use their proofs to guide the LLM, and (2) a formal verifier evaluates the generated proofs and provides feedback, helping the model fix incorrect proofs. We demonstrate that our method significantly improves proof accuracy for OpenAI's o1 model (58%-70% improvement); both analogous problems and the verifier's feedback contribute to these gains. More broadly, shifting to LLMs that generate provably correct conclusions could dramatically improve their reliability, accuracy and consistency, unlocking complex tasks and critical real-world applications that require trustworthiness.</p></details> | long paper |
| **[Boosting Rust Unit Test Coverage through Hybrid Program Analysis and Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09002v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unit testing is essential for ensuring software reliability and correctness. Classic Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) methods and concolic execution-based approaches for generating unit tests often fail to achieve high coverage due to difficulties in handling complex program units, such as branching conditions and external dependencies. Recent work has increasingly utilized large language models (LLMs) to generate test cases, improving the quality of test generation by providing better context and correcting errors in the model's output. However, these methods rely on fixed prompts, resulting in relatively low compilation success rates and coverage. This paper presents PALM, an approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to enhance the generation of high-coverage unit tests. PALM performs program analysis to identify branching conditions within functions, which are then combined into path constraints. These constraints and relevant contextual information are used to construct prompts that guide the LLMs in generating unit tests. We implement the approach and evaluate it in 10 open-source Rust crates. Experimental results show that within just two or three hours, PALM can significantly improves test coverage compared to classic methods, with increases in overall project coverage exceeding 50% in some instances and its generated tests achieving an average coverage of 75.77%, comparable to human effort (71.30%), highlighting the potential of LLMs in automated test generation. We submitted 91 PALM-generated unit tests targeting new code. Of these submissions, 80 were accepted, 5 were rejected, and 6 remain pending review. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating program analysis with AI and open new avenues for future research in automated software testing.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |
| **[SwS: Self-aware Weakness-driven Problem Synthesis in Reinforcement Learning for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08989v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective for training large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks, such as mathematical problem solving. A prerequisite for the scalability of RLVR is a high-quality problem set with precise and verifiable answers. However, the scarcity of well-crafted human-labeled math problems and limited-verification answers in existing distillation-oriented synthetic datasets limit their effectiveness in RL. Additionally, most problem synthesis strategies indiscriminately expand the problem set without considering the model's capabilities, leading to low efficiency in generating useful questions. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a Self-aware Weakness-driven problem Synthesis framework (SwS) that systematically identifies model deficiencies and leverages them for problem augmentation. Specifically, we define weaknesses as questions that the model consistently fails to learn through its iterative sampling during RL training. We then extract the core concepts from these failure cases and synthesize new problems to strengthen the model's weak areas in subsequent augmented training, enabling it to focus on and gradually overcome its weaknesses. Without relying on external knowledge distillation, our framework enables robust generalization byempowering the model to self-identify and address its weaknesses in RL, yielding average performance gains of 10.0% and 7.7% on 7B and 32B models across eight mainstream reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Reinf...</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning; Large Language Models; LLM Reasoning</p></details> |

We introduce DefenderBench, a practical, open-source toolkit for evaluating language agents across offense, defense, and cybersecurity knowledge-based tasks. DefenderBench includes environments for network intrusion, malicious content detection, code vulnerability analysis, and cybersecurity knowledge assessment. It is intentionally designed to be affordable and easily accessible for researchers while providing fair and rigorous assessment. We benchmark several state-of-the-art (SoTA) and popular LLMs, including both open- and closed-weight models, using a standardized agentic framework. Our results show that Claude-3.7-sonnet performs best with a DefenderBench score of 81.65, followed by Claude-3.7-sonnet-think with 78.40, while the best open-weight model, Llama 3.3 70B, is not far behind with a DefenderBench score of 71.81. DefenderBench's modular design allows seamless integration of custom LLMs and tasks, promoting reproducibility and fair comparisons. An anonymized version of DefenderBench is available at https://github.com/microsoft/DefenderBench.</p></details> |  |
| **[PrisonBreak: Jailbreaking Large Language Models with Fewer Than Twenty-Five Targeted Bit-flips](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07192v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new class of attacks on commercial-scale (human-aligned) language models that induce jailbreaking through targeted bitwise corruptions in model parameters. Our adversary can jailbreak billion-parameter language models with fewer than 25 bit-flips in all cases$-$and as few as 5 in some$-$using up to 40$\times$ less bit-flips than existing attacks on computer vision models at least 100$\times$ smaller. Unlike prompt-based jailbreaks, our attack renders these models in memory 'uncensored' at runtime, allowing them to generate harmful responses without any input modifications. Our attack algorithm efficiently identifies target bits to flip, offering up to 20$\times$ more computational efficiency than previous methods. This makes it practical for language models with billions of parameters. We show an end-to-end exploitation of our attack using software-induced fault injection, Rowhammer (RH). Our work examines 56 DRAM RH profiles from DDR4 and LPDDR4X devices with different RH vulnerabilities. We show that our attack can reliably induce jailbreaking in systems similar to those affected by prior bit-flip attacks. Moreover, our approach remains effective even against highly RH-secure systems (e.g., 46$\times$ more secure than previously tested systems). Our analyses further reveal that: (1) models with less post-training alignment require fewer bit flips to jailbreak; (2) certain model components, such as value projection layers, are substantially more vulnerable than others; and (3) our method is mechanistically different than existing jailbreaks. Our findings highlight a pressing, practical threat to the language model ecosystem and underscore the need for research to protect these models from bit-flip attacks.</p></details> | Pre-print |
| **[DiffLM: Controllable Synthetic Data Generation via Diffusion Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03250v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their knowledge and generative capabilities, leading to a surge of interest in leveraging LLMs for high-quality data synthesis. However, synthetic data generation via prompting LLMs remains challenging due to LLMs' limited understanding of target data distributions and the complexity of prompt engineering, especially for structured formatted data. To address these issues, we introduce DiffLM, a controllable data synthesis framework based on variational autoencoder (VAE), which further (1) leverages diffusion models to reserve more information of original distribution and format structure in the learned latent distribution and (2) decouples the learning of target distribution knowledge from the LLM's generative objectives via a plug-and-play latent feature injection module. As we observed significant discrepancies between the VAE's latent representations and the real data distribution, the latent diffusion module is introduced into our framework to learn a fully expressive latent distribution. Evaluations on seven real-world datasets with structured formatted data (i.e., Tabular, Code, and Tool data) demonstrate that DiffLM generates high-quality data, with performance on downstream tasks surpassing that of real data by 2%-7% in certain cases. Data and code are available at https://github.com/bytedance/DiffLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 9 figures, Accepted by ACL 2025, Findings</p></details> |
| **[AdaDec: Uncertainty-Guided Adaptive Decoding for LLM-based Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08980v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code generation with large language models (LLMs) is highly sensitive to token selection during decoding, particularly at uncertain decision points that influence program logic. While standard strategies like greedy and beam search treat all tokens uniformly, they overlook code-specific uncertainty patterns, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper presents an empirical study revealing that many generation errors stem from ranking mistakes at high-uncertainty steps, where the correct token is present but not top-ranked. Motivated by these findings, we propose AdaDec, an uncertainty-guided adaptive decoding framework that integrates a token-level pause-then-rerank mechanism driven by token uncertainty (Shannon entropy). AdaDec learns model-specific uncertainty thresholds and applies a lookahead-based reranking strategy when uncertainty is high. Experiments on HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks show that AdaDec improves Pass@1 accuracy by up to 15.5% over greedy decoding, outperforms or matches beam search, and reduces computational cost and latency through efficient, selective pausing. Our results highlight the promise of uncertainty-aware adaptive decoding for improving the reliability and efficiency of LLM-based code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Propositional Logic for Probing Generalization in Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08978v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The extent to which neural networks are able to acquire and represent symbolic rules remains a key topic of research and debate. Much current work focuses on the impressive capabilities of large language models, as well as their often ill-understood failures on a wide range of reasoning tasks. In this paper, in contrast, we investigate the generalization behavior of three key neural architectures (Transformers, Graph Convolution Networks and LSTMs) in a controlled task rooted in propositional logic. The task requires models to generate satisfying assignments for logical formulas, making it a structured and interpretable setting for studying compositionality. We introduce a balanced extension of an existing dataset to eliminate superficial patterns and enable testing on unseen operator combinations. Using this dataset, we evaluate the ability of the three architectures to generalize beyond the training distribution. While all models perform well in-distribution, we find that generalization to unseen patterns, particularly those involving negation, remains a significant challenge. Transformers fail to apply negation compositionally, unless structural biases are introduced. Our findings highlight persistent limitations in the ability of standard architectures to learn systematic representations of logical operators, suggesting the need for stronger inductive biases to support robust rule-based reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Atomic-to-Compositional Generalization for Mobile Agents with A New Benchmark and Scheduling System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08972v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous agents powered by multimodal large language models have been developed to facilitate task execution on mobile devices. However, prior work has predominantly focused on atomic tasks -- such as shot-chain execution tasks and single-screen grounding tasks -- while overlooking the generalization to compositional tasks, which are indispensable for real-world applications. This work introduces UI-NEXUS, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate mobile agents on three categories of compositional operations: Simple Concatenation, Context Transition, and Deep Dive. UI-NEXUS supports interactive evaluation in 20 fully controllable local utility app environments, as well as 30 online Chinese and English service apps. It comprises 100 interactive task templates with an average optimal step count of 14.05. Experimental results across a range of mobile agents with agentic workflow or agent-as-a-model show that UI-NEXUS presents significant challenges. Specifically, existing agents generally struggle to balance performance and efficiency, exhibiting representative failure modes such as under-execution, over-execution, and attention drift, causing visible atomic-to-compositional generalization gap. Inspired by these findings, we propose AGENT-NEXUS, a lightweight and efficient scheduling system to tackle compositional mobile tasks. AGENT-NEXUS extrapolates the abilities of existing mobile agents by dynamically decomposing long-horizon tasks to a series of self-contained atomic subtasks. AGENT-NEXUS achieves 24% to 40% task success rate improvement for existing mobile agents on compositional operation tasks within the UI-NEXUS benchmark without significantly sacrificing inference overhead. The demo video, dataset, and code are available on the project page at https://ui-nexus.github.io.</p></details> |  |
| **[ADAM: Autonomous Discovery and Annotation Model using LLMs for Context-Aware Annotations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08968v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection models typically rely on predefined categories, limiting their ability to identify novel objects in open-world scenarios. To overcome this constraint, we introduce ADAM: Autonomous Discovery and Annotation Model, a training-free, self-refining framework for open-world object labeling. ADAM leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate candidate labels for unknown objects based on contextual information from known entities within a scene. These labels are paired with visual embeddings from CLIP to construct an Embedding-Label Repository (ELR) that enables inference without category supervision. For a newly encountered unknown object, ADAM retrieves visually similar instances from the ELR and applies frequency-based voting and cross-modal re-ranking to assign a robust label. To further enhance consistency, we introduce a self-refinement loop that re-evaluates repository labels using visual cohesion analysis and k-nearest-neighbor-based majority re-labeling. Experimental results on the COCO and PASCAL datasets demonstrate that ADAM effectively annotates novel categories using only visual and contextual signals, without requiring any fine-tuning or retraining.</p></details> |  |

We detail the tutor's design philosophy and core components, including open-ended question answering and homework feedback generation. The prompts are carefully crafted to optimize responses across different problems. The smart tutor was deployed on the Microsoft Azure platform and is currently in use in an undergraduate circuit analysis course at the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering in a large, public, research-intensive institution in the Southeastern United States. Beyond offering personalized instruction and feedback, the tutor collects student interaction data, which is summarized and shared with the course instructor. To evaluate its effectiveness, we collected student feedback, with 90.9% of responses indicating satisfaction with the tutor. Additionally, we analyze a subset of collected data on preliminary circuit analysis topics to assess tutor usage frequency for each problem and identify frequently asked questions. These insights help instructors gain real-time awareness of student difficulties, enabling more targeted classroom instruction. In future work, we will release a full analysis once the complete dataset is available after the Spring 2025 semester. We also explore the potential applications of this smart tutor across a broader range of engineering disciplines by developing improved prompts, diagram-recognition methods, and database management strategies, which remain ongoing areas of research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2025 Frontiers in Education (FIE) Conference</p></details> |
| **[AI as Decision-Maker: Ethics and Risk Preferences of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01168v3)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit surprisingly diverse risk preferences when acting as AI decision makers, a crucial characteristic whose origins remain poorly understood despite their expanding economic roles. We analyze 50 LLMs using behavioral tasks, finding stable but diverse risk profiles. Alignment tuning for harmlessness, helpfulness, and honesty significantly increases risk aversion, causally increasing risk aversion confirmed via comparative difference analysis: a ten percent ethics increase cuts risk appetite two to eight percent. This induced caution persists against prompts and affects economic forecasts. Alignment enhances safety but may also suppress valuable risk taking, revealing a tradeoff risking suboptimal economic outcomes. With AI models becoming more powerful and influential in economic decisions while alignment grows increasingly critical, our empirical framework serves as an adaptable and enduring benchmark to track risk preferences and monitor this crucial tension between ethical alignment and economically valuable risk-taking.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can LLMs Ground when they (Don't) Know: A Study on Direct and Loaded Political Questions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08952v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Communication among humans relies on conversational grounding, allowing interlocutors to reach mutual understanding even when they do not have perfect knowledge and must resolve discrepancies in each other's beliefs. This paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) manage common ground in cases where they (don't) possess knowledge, focusing on facts in the political domain where the risk of misinformation and grounding failure is high. We examine the ability of LLMs to answer direct knowledge questions and loaded questions that presuppose misinformation. We evaluate whether loaded questions lead LLMs to engage in active grounding and correct false user beliefs, in connection to their level of knowledge and their political bias. Our findings highlight significant challenges in LLMs' ability to engage in grounding and reject false user beliefs, raising concerns about their role in mitigating misinformation in political discourse.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint accepted at ACL Main Conference 2025</p></details> |
| **[FaithfulRAG: Fact-Level Conflict Modeling for Context-Faithful Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08938v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) augmented with retrieval systems have demonstrated significant potential in handling knowledge-intensive tasks. However, these models often struggle with unfaithfulness issues, generating outputs that either ignore the retrieved context or inconsistently blend it with the LLM`s parametric knowledge. This issue is particularly severe in cases of knowledge conflict, where the retrieved context conflicts with the model`s parametric knowledge. While existing faithful RAG approaches enforce strict context adherence through well-designed prompts or modified decoding strategies, our analysis reveals a critical limitation: they achieve faithfulness by forcibly suppressing the model`s parametric knowledge, which undermines the model`s internal knowledge structure and increases the risk of misinterpreting the context. To this end, this paper proposes FaithfulRAG, a novel framework that resolves knowledge conflicts by explicitly modeling discrepancies between the model`s parametric knowledge and retrieved context. Specifically, FaithfulRAG identifies conflicting knowledge at the fact level and designs a self-thinking process, allowing LLMs to reason about and integrate conflicting facts before generating responses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https:// github.com/DeepLearnXMU/Faithful-RAG</p></details> | <details><summary>Qingg...</summary><p>Qinggang Zhang and Zhishang Xiang contributed equally to this work.

| **[The Impact of Large Language Models on Open-source Innovation: Evidence from GitHub Copilot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08379v3)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to enhance individual productivity in guided settings. Whereas LLMs are likely to also transform innovation processes in a collaborative work setting, it is unclear what trajectory this transformation will follow. Innovation in these contexts encompasses both capability innovation that explores new possibilities by acquiring new competencies in a project and iterative innovation that exploits existing foundations by enhancing established competencies and improving project quality. Whether LLMs affect these two aspects of collaborative work and to what extent is an open empirical question. Open-source development provides an ideal setting to examine LLM impacts on these innovation types, as its voluntary and open/collaborative nature of contributions provides the greatest opportunity for technological augmentation. We focus on open-source projects on GitHub by leveraging a natural experiment around the selective rollout of GitHub Copilot (a programming-focused LLM) in October 2021, where GitHub Copilot selectively supported programming languages like Python or Rust, but not R or Haskell. We observe a significant jump in overall contributions, suggesting that LLMs effectively augment collaborative innovation in an unguided setting. Interestingly, Copilot's launch increased iterative innovation focused on maintenance-related or feature-refining contributions significantly more than it did capability innovation through code-development or feature-introducing commits. This disparity was more pronounced after the model upgrade in June 2022 and was evident in active projects with extensive coding activity, suggesting that as both LLM capabilities and/or available contextual information improve, the gap between capability and iterative innovation may widen. We discuss practical and policy implications to incentivize high-value innovative solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>JEL C...</summary><p>JEL Classification: O31, C88, J24, O35, L86</p></details> |

Recent advancements have reduced costs for training capable models, yet even these approaches rely on high-end hardware clusters. In this paper, we demonstrate that a single average gaming GPU can train a solid mathematical reasoning model, by integrating reinforcement learning and memory optimization techniques. Specifically, we train a 1.5B parameter mathematical reasoning model on RTX 3080 Ti of 16GB memory that achieves comparable or better performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks than models several times larger, in resource-constrained environments. Our results challenge the paradigm that state-of-the-art mathematical reasoning necessitates massive infrastructure, democratizing access to high-performance AI research. https://github.com/shinandrew/YouronMath.</p></details> |  |

OmniBench: A Scalable Multi-Dimensional Benchmark for Essential Virtual Agent Capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08933v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) advance, MLLM-based virtual agents have demonstrated remarkable performance. However, existing benchmarks face significant limitations, including uncontrollable task complexity, extensive manual annotation with limited scenarios, and a lack of multidimensional evaluation. In response to these challenges, we introduce OmniBench, a self-generating, cross-platform, graph-based benchmark with an automated pipeline for synthesizing tasks of controllable complexity through subtask composition. To evaluate the diverse capabilities of virtual agents on the graph, we further present OmniEval, a multidimensional evaluation framework that includes subtask-level evaluation, graph-based metrics, and comprehensive tests across 10 capabilities. Our synthesized dataset contains 36k graph-structured tasks across 20 scenarios, achieving a 91\% human acceptance rate. Training on our graph-structured data shows that it can more efficiently guide agents compared to manually annotated data. We conduct multidimensional evaluations for various open-source and closed-source models, revealing their performance across various capabilities and paving the way for future advancements.

We present a hypernetwork-based approach for knowledge propagation, named PropMEND, where we meta-learn how to modify gradients of a language modeling loss to encourage injected information to propagate. Our approach extends the meta-objective of MEND [29] so that gradient updates on knowledge are transformed to enable answering multi-hop questions involving that knowledge. We show improved performance on the RippleEdit dataset, showing almost 2x accuracy on challenging multi-hop questions whose answers are not explicitly stated in the injected fact. We further introduce a new dataset, Controlled RippleEdit, to evaluate the generalization of our hypernetwork, testing knowledge propagation along relations and entities unseen during hypernetwork training. PropMEND still outperforms existing approaches in unseen entity-relation pairs, yet the performance gap decreases substantially, suggesting future work in propagating knowledge to a wide range of relations.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Quantifying Mix Network Privacy Erosion with Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08918v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern mix networks improve over Tor and provide stronger privacy guarantees by robustly obfuscating metadata. As long as a message is routed through at least one honest mixnode, the privacy of the users involved is safeguarded. However, the complexity of the mixing mechanisms makes it difficult to estimate the cumulative privacy erosion occurring over time. This work uses a generative model trained on mixnet traffic to estimate the loss of privacy when users communicate persistently over a period of time. We train our large-language model from scratch on our specialized network traffic ``language'' and then use it to measure the sender-message unlinkability in various settings (e.g. mixing strategies, security parameters, observation window). Our findings reveal notable differences in privacy levels among mix strategies, even when they have similar mean latencies. In comparison, we demonstrate the limitations of traditional privacy metrics, such as entropy and log-likelihood, in fully capturing an adversary's potential to synthesize information from multiple observations. Finally, we show that larger models exhibit greater sample efficiency and superior capabilities implying that further advancements in transformers will consequently enhance the accuracy of model-based privacy estimates.</p></details> |  |

Dialect-to-standard normalization attempts to tackle this issue by transforming dialectal text so that it can be used by standard-language tools downstream. In this study, we tackle this task by introducing a new normalization method that combines rule-based linguistically informed transformations and large language models (LLMs) with targeted few-shot prompting, without requiring any parallel data. We implement our method for Greek dialects and apply it on a dataset of regional proverbs, evaluating the outputs using human annotators. We then use this dataset to conduct downstream experiments, finding that previous results regarding these proverbs relied solely on superficial linguistic information, including orthographic artifacts, while new observations can still be made through the remaining semantics.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 18 figures, to be published in the Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics 2025</p></details> |

The lack of annotated essay datasets inhibits the development of Arabic AES systems. This paper leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Transformer models to generate synthetic Arabic essays for AES. We prompt an LLM to generate essays across the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) proficiency levels and introduce and compare two approaches to error injection. We create a dataset of 3,040 annotated essays with errors injected using our two methods. Additionally, we develop a BERT-based Arabic AES system calibrated to CEFR levels. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our synthetic dataset in improving Arabic AES performance. We make our code and data publicly available.</p></details> |  |

We propose a structured pipeline that segments complex normative language into atomic snippets, extracts deontic rules, and evaluates them for syntactic and semantic coherence. Our methodology is evaluated across various LLM configurations, including prompt engineering strategies, fine-tuned models, and multi-stage pipelines, focusing on legal norms from the Australian Telecommunications Consumer Protections Code. Empirical results demonstrate promising alignment between machine-generated and expert-crafted formalizations, showing that LLMs - particularly when prompted effectively - can significantly contribute to scalable legal informatics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pivoting Factorization: A Compact Meta Low-Rank Representation of Sparsity for Efficient Inference in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19090v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of Large Language Models has driven demand for effective model compression techniques to reduce memory and computation costs. Low-rank pruning has gained attention for its GPU compatibility across all densities. However, low-rank pruning struggles to match the performance of semi-structured pruning, often doubling perplexity at similar densities. In this paper, we propose Pivoting Factorization (PIFA), a novel lossless meta low-rank representation that unsupervisedly learns a compact form of any low-rank representation, effectively eliminating redundant information. PIFA identifies pivot rows (linearly independent rows) and expresses non-pivot rows as linear combinations, achieving 24.2% additional memory savings and 24.6% faster inference over low-rank layers at rank = 50% of dimension. To mitigate the performance degradation caused by low-rank pruning, we introduce a novel, retraining-free reconstruction method that minimizes error accumulation (M). MPIFA, combining M and PIFA into an end-to-end framework, significantly outperforms existing low-rank pruning methods, and achieves performance comparable to semi-structured pruning, while surpassing it in GPU efficiency and compatibility.

While including text in more than one language is an obvious way to acquire more pretraining data, multilinguality is often seen as a curse, and most model training efforts continue to focus near-exclusively on individual large languages. We believe that multilinguality can be a blessing: when the lack of training data is a constraint for effectively training larger models for a target language, augmenting the dataset with other languages can offer a way to improve over the capabilities of monolingual models for that language. In this study, we introduce Poro 34B, a 34 billion parameter model trained for 1 trillion tokens of Finnish, English, and programming languages, and demonstrate that a multilingual training approach can produce a model that substantially advances over the capabilities of existing models for Finnish and excels in translation, while also achieving competitive performance in its class for English and programming languages. We release the model parameters, scripts, and data under open licenses at https://huggingface.co/LumiOpen/Poro-34B.</p></details> |  |

These models are increasingly being utilized for a range of SE tasks, including requirements engineering and design, code analysis and generation, software maintenance, and quality assurance. As LLMs become more integral to SE, evaluating their effectiveness is crucial for understanding their potential in this field. In recent years, substantial efforts have been made to assess LLM performance in various SE tasks, resulting in the creation of several benchmarks tailored to this purpose. This paper offers a thorough review of 191 benchmarks, addressing three main aspects: what benchmarks are available, how benchmarks are constructed, and the future outlook for these benchmarks. We begin by examining SE tasks such as requirements engineering and design, coding assistant, software testing, AIOPs, software maintenance, and quality management. We then analyze the benchmarks and their development processes, highlighting the limitations of existing benchmarks. Additionally, we discuss the successes and failures of LLMs in different software tasks and explore future opportunities and challenges for SE-related benchmarks. We aim to provide a comprehensive overview of benchmark research in SE and offer insights to support the creation of more effective evaluation tools.</p></details> |  |

It employs high-frequency ultrasound waves to generate detailed images of the internal structures of the human body. However, manually contouring regions of interest in these images is a labor-intensive task that demands expertise and often results in inconsistent interpretations among individuals. Vision-language foundation models, which have excelled in various computer vision applications, present new opportunities for enhancing ultrasound image analysis. Yet, their performance is hindered by the significant differences between natural and medical imaging domains. This research seeks to overcome these challenges by developing domain adaptation methods for vision-language foundation models. In this study, we explore the fine-tuning pipeline for vision-language foundation models by utilizing large language model as text refiner with special-designed adaptation strategies and task-driven heads. Our approach has been extensively evaluated on six ultrasound datasets and two tasks: segmentation and classification. The experimental results show that our method can effectively improve the performance of vision-language foundation models for ultrasound image analysis, and outperform the existing state-of-the-art vision-language and pure foundation models.

To address these issues, we propose a novel training method that integrates a bidirectional chains of thought and a reward mechanism. This method is built upon ICH-Qwen, a large language model specifically designed for the field of intangible cultural heritage. The proposed method enables the model to not only perform forward reasoning but also enhances the accuracy of the generated answers by utilizing reverse questioning and reverse reasoning to activate the model's latent knowledge. Additionally, a reward mechanism is introduced during training to optimize the decision-making process. This mechanism improves the quality of the model's outputs through structural and content evaluations with different weighting schemes. We conduct comparative experiments on ICH-Qwen, with results demonstrating that our method outperforms 0-shot, step-by-step reasoning, knowledge distillation, and question augmentation methods in terms of accuracy, Bleu-4, and Rouge-L scores on the question-answering task. Furthermore, the paper highlights the effectiveness of combining the bidirectional chains of thought and reward mechanism through ablation experiments. In addition, a series of generalizability experiments are conducted, with results showing that the proposed method yields improvements on various domain-specific datasets and advanced models in areas such as Finance, Wikidata, and StrategyQA. This demonstrates that the method is adaptable to multiple domains and provides a valuable approach for model training in future applications across diverse fields.</p></details> | <details><summary>We wa...</summary><p>We want to withdraw this paper due to data usage permission issues identified after submission.

These facts can become outdated over time, which has led to the development of knowledge editing methods (KEs) that can change specific facts in LLMs with limited side effects. This position paper argues that editing LLMs poses serious safety risks that have been largely overlooked. First, we note the fact that KEs are widely available, computationally inexpensive, highly performant, and stealthy makes them an attractive tool for malicious actors. Second, we discuss malicious use cases of KEs, showing how KEs can be easily adapted for a variety of malicious purposes. Third, we highlight vulnerabilities in the AI ecosystem that allow unrestricted uploading and downloading of updated models without verification. Fourth, we argue that a lack of social and institutional awareness exacerbates this risk, and discuss the implications for different stakeholders. We call on the community to (i) research tamper-resistant models and countermeasures against malicious model editing, and (ii) actively engage in securing the AI ecosystem.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025</p></details> |

Among the most pressing threats are prompt injection attacks, which exploit the agent's resilience on natural language inputs -- an especially dangerous threat when agents are granted tool access or handle sensitive information. In this work, we propose a set of principled design patterns for building AI agents with provable resistance to prompt injection. We systematically analyze these patterns, discuss their trade-offs in terms of utility and security, and illustrate their real-world applicability through a series of case studies.</p></details> |  |

Extracting entities such as percentages of physical and/or psychological disability and the involved compensation amounts is a challenging process, even for experts, due to the subtle arguments and reasoning in the court decision. A two-step procedure is proposed: first, segmenting the document identifying the most relevant segments, and then extracting the entities. For text segmentation, two methodologies are compared: a classic method based on regular expressions and a second approach that divides the document into blocks of n-tokens, which are then vectorized using multilingual models for semantic searches (text-embedding-ada-002/MiniLM-L12-v2 ). Subsequently, large language models (LLaMA-2 7b, 70b, LLaMA-3 8b, and GPT-4 Turbo) are applied with prompting to the selected segments for entity extraction. For the LLaMA models, fine-tuning is performed using LoRA. LLaMA-2 7b, even with zero temperature, shows a significant number of hallucinations in extractions which are an important contention point for named entity extraction. This work shows that these hallucinations are substantially reduced after finetuning the model. The performance of the methodology based on segment vectorization and subsequent use of LLMs significantly surpasses the classic method which achieves an accuracy of 39.5%. Among open-source models, LLaMA-2 70B with finetuning achieves the highest accuracy 79.4%, surpassing its base version 61.7%. Notably, the base LLaMA-3 8B model already performs comparably to the finetuned LLaMA-2 70B model, achieving 76.6%, highlighting the rapid progress in model development. Meanwhile, GPT-4 Turbo achieves the highest accuracy at 86.1%.</p></details> |  |

Existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods often depend on costly human annotations or external reward models. We propose Reinforcement Learning via Self-Confidence (RLSC), which uses the model's own confidence as reward signals-eliminating the need for labels, preference models, or reward engineering. Applied to Qwen2.5-Math-7B with only 16 samples per question and 10 or 20 training steps, RLSC improves accuracy by +13.4% on AIME2024, +21.2% on MATH500, +21.7% on Minerva Math, +20.8% on Olympiadbench, and +9.7% on AMC23. RLSC provides a simple, scalable post-training method for inference models, requiring only a small number of samples and unlabelled supervision.</p></details> |  |

However, many critical languages, such as COBOL, as well as emerging languages, such as Rust and Swift, remain low-resource due to limited openly available code. This scarcity hampers the training and effectiveness of LLMs for these languages, increasing software maintenance costs and stifling innovation. Addressing this gap, we investigate the potential of transfer learning to enhance LLM performance on low-resource programming languages by leveraging data from high-resource counterparts. Our extensive empirical study evaluates transferability across 10 to 41 programming languages and five key tasks: code generation, clone detection, code repair, solution domain classification, and error detection. Additionally, we develop a performance prediction model to guess the best source languages for a given target and task, and analyze the features that influence transfer performance. We further replicate a representative subset of experiments with a larger model to test the generalizability of our conclusions to contemporary large-scale LLMs. Our findings demonstrate that cross-lingual transfer significantly outperforms zero-shot learning, with effectiveness varying based on both source and target languages. Furthermore, our model reliably predicts successful transfer sources by considering linguistic and dataset-specific features, offering practical guidance for data acquisition and model training. This work contributes to the development of LLM-driven tools for low-resource programming languages and provides insights into the characteristics that facilitate transfer across language pairs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (06/2025) 26 pages, 5 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

The advanced capabilities of LLM-based programming assistants to support software development tasks have led to a rise in the adoption of LLMs in SE. However, little is known about the evidenced-based practices, tools and processes verified by research findings, supported and adopted by AI programming assistants. To this end, our work conducts a preliminary evaluation exploring the beliefs of LLM used to support software development tasks. We investigate 17 evidence-based claims posited by empirical SE research across five LLM-based programming assistants. Our findings show that LLM-based programming assistants have ambiguous beliefs regarding research claims and lack credible evidence to support responses. Based on our results, we provide implications for practitioners adopting LLM-based programming assistants in development contexts and shed light on future research directions to enhance the reliability and trustworthiness of LLMs -- aiming to increase awareness and adoption of evidence-based SE research findings in practice.</p></details> |  |

Despite the growing need for automated equivalence checks -- driven, for example, by optimization copilots, which generate problem formulations from natural language descriptions -- current approaches rely on simple heuristics that fail to reliably check formulation equivalence. Inspired by Karp reductions, in this work we introduce Quasi-Karp equivalence, a formal criterion for determining when two optimization formulations are equivalent based on the existence of a mapping between their decision variables. We propose EquivaMap, a framework that leverages large language models to automatically discover such mappings for scalable, reliable equivalence checking, with a verification stage that ensures mapped solutions preserve feasibility and optimality without additional solver calls. To evaluate our approach, we construct EquivaFormulation, the first open-source dataset of equivalent optimization formulations, generated by applying transformations such as adding slack variables or valid inequalities to existing formulations. Empirically, EquivaMap significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving substantial improvements in correctly identifying formulation equivalence.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAFEFLOW: A Principled Protocol for Trustworthy and Transactional Autonomous Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07564v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled powerful autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning and multi-modal tool use. Despite their growing capabilities, today's agent frameworks remain fragile, lacking principled mechanisms for secure information flow, reliability, and multi-agent coordination. In this work, we introduce SAFEFLOW, a new protocol-level framework for building trustworthy LLM/VLM-based agents. SAFEFLOW enforces fine-grained information flow control (IFC), precisely tracking provenance, integrity, and confidentiality of all the data exchanged between agents, tools, users, and environments. By constraining LLM reasoning to respect these security labels, SAFEFLOW prevents untrusted or adversarial inputs from contaminating high-integrity decisions. To ensure robustness in concurrent multi-agent settings, SAFEFLOW introduces transactional execution, conflict resolution, and secure scheduling over shared state, preserving global consistency across agents. We further introduce mechanisms, including write-ahead logging, rollback, and secure caches, that further enhance resilience against runtime errors and policy violations. To validate the performances, we built SAFEFLOWBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark suite designed to evaluate agent reliability under adversarial, noisy, and concurrent operational conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that agents built with SAFEFLOW maintain impressive task performance and security guarantees even in hostile environments, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art. Together, SAFEFLOW and SAFEFLOWBENCH lay the groundwork for principled, robust, and secure agent ecosystems, advancing the frontier of reliable autonomy.</p></details> |  |

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as assistants for data science, by suggesting ideas, techniques and small code snippets, or for the interpretation of results and reporting. Proper automation of some data-science activities is now promised by the rise of LLM agents, i.e., AI systems powered by an LLM equipped with additional affordances--such as code execution and knowledge bases--that can perform self-directed actions and interact with digital environments. In this paper, we survey the evaluation of LLM assistants and agents for data science. We find (1) a dominant focus on a small subset of goal-oriented activities, largely ignoring data management and exploratory activities; (2) a concentration on pure assistance or fully autonomous agents, without considering intermediate levels of human-AI collaboration; and (3) an emphasis on human substitution, therefore neglecting the possibility of higher levels of automation thanks to task transformation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Delving into RL for Image Generation with CoT: A Study on DPO vs. GRPO](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17017v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements underscore the significant role of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in enhancing the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Two prominent RL algorithms, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), are central to these developments, showcasing different pros and cons. Autoregressive image generation, also interpretable as a sequential CoT reasoning process, presents unique challenges distinct from LLM-based CoT reasoning. These encompass ensuring text-image consistency, improving image aesthetic quality, and designing sophisticated reward models, rather than relying on simpler rule-based rewards. While recent efforts have extended RL to this domain, these explorations typically lack an in-depth analysis of the domain-specific challenges and the characteristics of different RL strategies. To bridge this gap, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of the GRPO and DPO algorithms in autoregressive image generation, evaluating their in-domain performance and out-of-domain generalization, while scrutinizing the impact of different reward models on their respective capabilities. Our findings reveal that GRPO and DPO exhibit distinct advantages, and crucially, that reward models possessing stronger intrinsic generalization capabilities potentially enhance the generalization potential of the applied RL algorithms. Furthermore, we systematically explore three prevalent scaling strategies to enhance both their in-domain and out-of-domain proficiency, deriving unique insights into efficiently scaling performance for each paradigm. We hope our study paves a new path for inspiring future work on developing more effective RL algorithms to achieve robust CoT reasoning in the realm of autoregressive image generation.

This study investigates the generation of parametric sequences for computer-aided design (CAD) models using LLMs. This endeavor represents an initial step towards creating parametric 3D shapes with LLMs, as CAD model parameters directly correlate with shapes in three-dimensional space. Despite the formidable generative capacities of LLMs, this task remains challenging, as these models neither encounter parametric sequences during their pretraining phase nor possess direct awareness of 3D structures. To address this, we present CAD-Llama, a framework designed to enhance pretrained LLMs for generating parametric 3D CAD models. Specifically, we develop a hierarchical annotation pipeline and a code-like format to translate parametric 3D CAD command sequences into Structured Parametric CAD Code (SPCC), incorporating hierarchical semantic descriptions. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive pretraining approach utilizing SPCC, followed by an instruction tuning process aligned with CAD-specific guidelines. This methodology aims to equip LLMs with the spatial knowledge inherent in parametric sequences. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms prior autoregressive methods and existing LLM baselines.</p></details> |  |

Unlike humans, who naturally resist contradictory information, these models indiscriminately accept contradictions, leading to devastating interference, destroying up to 80% of unrelated knowledge even when learning as few as 10-100 contradicting facts. To understand whether this interference could be mitigated through selective plasticity, we experiment with targeted network updates, distinguishing between previously used (stubborn) and rarely used (plastic) neurons. We uncover another asymmetry: while sparing frequently-used neurons significantly improves retention of existing knowledge for non-contradictory updates (98% vs 93% with standard updates), contradictory updates trigger catastrophic interference regardless of targeting strategy. This effect which persists across tested model scales (GPT-2 to GPT-J-6B), suggests a fundamental limitation in how neural networks handle contradictions. Finally, we demonstrate that contradictory information can be reliably detected (95%+ accuracy) using simple model features, offering a potential protective mechanism. These findings motivate new architectures that can, like humans, naturally resist contradictions rather than allowing destructive overwrites.</p></details> |  |

Typical benchmarks for Video-LLMs rely simply on multiple-choice questions. Unfortunately, VideoLLMs hallucinate far more aggressively on freeform text generation tasks like video captioning than they do on multiple choice verification tasks. To address this weakness, we propose ARGUS, a VideoLLM benchmark that measures freeform video captioning performance. By comparing VideoLLM outputs to human ground truth captions, ARGUS quantifies dual metrics. First, we measure the rate of hallucinations in the form of incorrect statements about video content or temporal relationships. Second, we measure the rate at which the model omits important descriptive details. Together, these dual metrics form a comprehensive view of video captioning performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page with all the artifacts: https://ruchitrawal.github.io/argus</p></details> |

By translating the visual state representations of classic Atari games into rich textual descriptions, TextAtari creates a challenging test bed that bridges sequential decision-making with natural language processing. The benchmark includes nearly 100 distinct tasks with varying complexity, action spaces, and planning horizons, all rendered as text through an unsupervised representation learning framework (AtariARI). We evaluate three open-source large language models (Qwen2.5-7B, Gemma-7B, and Llama3.1-8B) across three agent frameworks (zero-shot, few-shot chain-of-thought, and reflection reasoning) to assess how different forms of prior knowledge affect performance on these long-horizon challenges. Four scenarios-Basic, Obscured, Manual Augmentation, and Reference-based-investigate the impact of semantic understanding, instruction comprehension, and expert demonstrations on agent decision-making. Our results reveal significant performance gaps between language agents and human players in extensive planning tasks, highlighting challenges in sequential reasoning, state tracking, and strategic planning across tens of thousands of steps. TextAtari provides standardized evaluation protocols, baseline implementations, and a framework for advancing research at the intersection of language models and planning.

Knowledge-based causal discovery -- which involves inferring causal relationships by reasoning over the metadata of variables (e.g., names or textual context) -- offers a compelling alternative to traditional methods that rely on observational data. However, existing methods using Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce unstable and inconsistent results, compromising their reliability for causal inference. To address this, we introduce a novel approach that integrates Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with LLMs to enhance knowledge-based causal discovery. Our approach identifies informative metapath-based subgraphs within KGs and further refines the selection of these subgraphs using Learning-to-Rank-based models. The top-ranked subgraphs are then incorporated into zero-shot prompts, improving the effectiveness of LLMs in inferring the causal relationship. Extensive experiments on biomedical and open-domain datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms most baselines by up to 44.4 points in F1 scores, evaluated across diverse LLMs and KGs. Our code and datasets are available on GitHub: https://github.com/susantiyuni/path-to-causality</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at KDD 2025 (full research paper)</p></details> |

This paper presents a comprehensive benchmarking study of multiple reasoning-focused LLMs, with a special emphasis on the newly introduced DeepSeek models, across a suite of fifteen Arabic NLP tasks. We experiment with various strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning. This allows us to systematically evaluate performance on datasets covering a range of applications to examine their capacity for linguistic reasoning under different levels of complexity. Our experiments reveal several key findings. First, carefully selecting just three in-context examples delivers an average uplift of over 13 F1 points on classification tasks-boosting sentiment analysis from 35.3% to 87.5% and paraphrase detection from 56.1% to 87.0%. Second, reasoning-focused DeepSeek architectures outperform a strong GPT o4-mini baseline by an average of 12 F1 points on complex inference tasks in the zero-shot setting. Third, LoRA-based fine-tuning yields up to an additional 8 points in F1 and BLEU compared to equivalent increases in model scale.

Value systems, such as Schwartz's Theory of Basic Human Values, delineate the hierarchy and interplay among these values, enabling cross-disciplinary investigations into decision-making and societal dynamics. Recently, the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised concerns regarding their elusive intrinsic values. Despite growing efforts in evaluating, understanding, and aligning LLM values, a psychologically grounded LLM value system remains underexplored. This study addresses the gap by introducing the Generative Psycho-Lexical Approach (GPLA), a scalable, adaptable, and theoretically informed method for constructing value systems. Leveraging GPLA, we propose a psychologically grounded five-factor value system tailored for LLMs. For systematic validation, we present three benchmarking tasks that integrate psychological principles with cutting-edge AI priorities. Our results reveal that the proposed value system meets standard psychological criteria, better captures LLM values, improves LLM safety prediction, and enhances LLM alignment, when compared to the canonical Schwartz's values.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACL 2024 Main</p></details> |

However, the scarcity of challenging financial datasets, particularly for Japanese financial data, impedes academic innovation in financial analytics. As LLMs advance, this lack of accessible research resources increasingly hinders their development and evaluation in this specialized domain. To address this gap, we introduce EDINET-Bench, an open-source Japanese financial benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of LLMs on challenging financial tasks including accounting fraud detection, earnings forecasting, and industry prediction. EDINET-Bench is constructed by downloading annual reports from the past 10 years from Japan's Electronic Disclosure for Investors' NETwork (EDINET) and automatically assigning labels corresponding to each evaluation task. Our experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle, performing only slightly better than logistic regression in binary classification for fraud detection and earnings forecasting. These results highlight significant challenges in applying LLMs to real-world financial applications and underscore the need for domain-specific adaptation. Our dataset, benchmark construction code, and evaluation code is publicly available to facilitate future research in finance with LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Existing QR approaches typically fall into two categories: discriminative models and generative methods leveraging large language models (LLMs). Discriminative models often struggle with natural language understanding and offer limited flexibility in rewriting, while generative LLMs, despite producing high-quality rewrites, face high inference latency and cost in online settings. These limitations force offline deployment, making them vulnerable to issues like information staleness and semantic drift. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel hybrid pipeline for QR that balances efficiency and effectiveness. Our approach combines offline knowledge distillation to create a lightweight but efficient student model with online reinforcement learning (RL) to refine query rewriting dynamically using real-time feedback. A key innovation is the use of LLMs as simulated human feedback, enabling scalable reward signals and cost-effective evaluation without manual annotations. Experimental results on Amazon ESCI dataset demonstrate significant improvements in query relevance, diversity, and adaptability, as well as positive feedback from the LLM simulation. This work contributes to advancing LLM capabilities for domain-specific applications, offering a robust solution for dynamic and complex e-commerce search environments.</p></details> |  |

Traditionally, natural language to SQL (NL-to-SQL) approaches have been explored for querying such data. While NL-to-SQL promises ease of use, it poses significant risks: end-users cannot easily validate generated SQL queries, and legacy nuclear plant databases -- often complex and poorly structured -- complicate query generation due to decades of incremental modifications. These challenges increase the likelihood of inaccuracies and reduce trust in the approach. In this work, we propose an alternative paradigm: leveraging function-calling large language models (LLMs) to address these challenges. Instead of directly generating SQL queries, we define a set of pre-approved, purpose-specific functions representing common use cases. Queries are processed by invoking these functions, which encapsulate validated SQL logic. This hybrid approach mitigates the risks associated with direct NL-to-SQL translations by ensuring that SQL queries are reviewed and optimized by experts before deployment. While this strategy introduces the upfront cost of developing and maintaining the function library, we demonstrate how NL-to-SQL tools can assist in the initial generation of function code, allowing experts to focus on validation rather than creation. Our study includes a performance comparison between direct NL-to-SQL generation and the proposed function-based approach, highlighting improvements in accuracy and maintainability. This work underscores the importance of balancing user accessibility with operational safety and provides a novel, actionable framework for robust data retrieval in critical systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>44th ...</summary><p>44th Annual CNS Conference and the 49th Annual CNS/CNA Student Conference, Westin Harbour Castle Hotel, Toronto, ON, Canada, June 8-11, 2025</p></details> |

This data, however, is not readily usable for advanced Large Language Model (LLM) applications that require clean, structured question-answer pairs for tasks like model training, fine-tuning, and evaluation. This paper explores how synthetic data generation can bridge this gap, enabling the development of robust LLMs for the nuclear domain. We discuss the challenges of data scarcity and privacy concerns inherent in the nuclear industry and how synthetic data provides a solution by transforming existing text data into usable Q&A pairs. This approach leverages LLMs to analyze text, extract key information, generate relevant questions, and evaluate the quality of the resulting synthetic dataset. By unlocking the potential of LLMs in the nuclear industry, synthetic data can pave the way for improved information retrieval, enhanced knowledge sharing, and more informed decision-making in this critical sector.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Secure and Private Language Models for Nuclear Power Plants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08746v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a domain-specific Large Language Model for nuclear applications, built from the publicly accessible Essential CANDU textbook. Drawing on a compact Transformer-based architecture, the model is trained on a single GPU to protect the sensitive data inherent in nuclear operations. Despite relying on a relatively small dataset, it shows encouraging signs of capturing specialized nuclear vocabulary, though the generated text sometimes lacks syntactic coherence. By focusing exclusively on nuclear content, this approach demonstrates the feasibility of in-house LLM solutions that align with rigorous cybersecurity and data confidentiality standards. Early successes in text generation underscore the model's utility for specialized tasks, while also revealing the need for richer corpora, more sophisticated preprocessing, and instruction fine-tuning to enhance domain accuracy. Future directions include extending the dataset to cover diverse nuclear subtopics, refining tokenization to reduce noise, and systematically evaluating the model's readiness for real-world applications in nuclear domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[Consistent Paths Lead to Truth: Self-Rewarding Reinforcement Learning for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08745v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances of Reinforcement Learning (RL) have highlighted its potential in complex reasoning tasks, yet effective training often relies on external supervision, which limits the broader applicability. In this work, we propose a novel self-rewarding reinforcement learning framework to enhance Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning by leveraging the consistency of intermediate reasoning states across different reasoning trajectories. Our key insight is that correct responses often exhibit consistent trajectory patterns in terms of model likelihood: their intermediate reasoning states tend to converge toward their own final answers (high consistency) with minimal deviation toward other candidates (low volatility). Inspired by this observation, we introduce CoVo, an intrinsic reward mechanism that integrates Consistency and Volatility via a robust vector-space aggregation strategy, complemented by a curiosity bonus to promote diverse exploration. CoVo enables LLMs to perform RL in a self-rewarding manner, offering a scalable pathway for learning to reason without external supervision. Extensive experiments on diverse reasoning benchmarks show that CoVo achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing supervised RL. Our code is available at https://github.com/sastpg/CoVo.</p></details> |  |

It may prove a hindrance to the Sustainability goals of any organization. A crucial step in any Sustainability strategy is monitoring or estimating the energy consumption of various components. While there exist multiple tools for monitoring energy consumption, there is a dearth of tools/frameworks for estimating the consumption or carbon emissions. Current drawbacks of both monitoring and estimation tools include high input data points, intrusive nature, high error margin, etc. We posit that leveraging emerging LLM benchmarks and related data points can help overcome aforementioned challenges while balancing accuracy of the emission estimations. To that extent, we discuss the challenges of current approaches and present our evolving framework, R-ICE, which estimates prompt level inference carbon emissions by leveraging existing state-of-the-art(SOTA) benchmark. This direction provides a more practical and non-intrusive way to enable emerging use-cases like dynamic LLM routing, carbon accounting, etc. Our promising validation results suggest that benchmark-based modelling holds great potential for inference emission estimation and warrants further exploration from the scientific community.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages.

However, LLMs still struggle with numerical question answering for financial documents that include tabular and textual data. Recent works have showed the effectiveness of critic agents (i.e., self-correction) for this task given oracle labels. Building upon this framework, this paper examines the effectiveness of the traditional critic agent when oracle labels are not available, and show, through experiments, that this critic agent's performance deteriorates in this scenario. With this in mind, we present an improved critic agent, along with the calculator agent which outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approach (program-of-thought) and is safer. Furthermore, we investigate how our agents interact with each other, and how this interaction affects their performance.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

While traditional Robotic Process Automation (RPA) has proven effective for repetitive, rule-based simple task automation, it faces limitations in handling unstructured data, exception management, and complex decision-making. This study designs and implements a four-stage integrated process comprising automatic recognition of supporting documents such as receipts via OCR/IDP, item classification based on a policy-driven database, intelligent exception handling supported by generative AI (large language models, LLMs), and human-in-the-loop final decision-making with continuous system learning through an Automation Agent. Applied to a major Korean enterprise (Company S), the system demonstrated quantitative benefits including over 80% reduction in processing time for paper receipt expense tasks, decreased error rates, and improved compliance, as well as qualitative benefits such as enhanced accuracy and consistency, increased employee satisfaction, and data-driven decision support. Furthermore, the system embodies a virtuous cycle by learning from human judgments to progressively improve automatic exception handling capabilities. Empirically, this research confirms that the organic integration of generative AI, IDP, and Automation Agents effectively overcomes the limitations of conventional automation and enables E2E automation of complex corporate processes. The study also discusses potential extensions to other domains such as accounting, human resources, and procurement, and proposes future directions for AI-driven hyper-automation development.</p></details> |  |

In particular, previous work has identified the absence of an intrinsic separation between instructions and data as a root cause of the success of prompt injection attacks. In this work, we propose a new architectural element, ASIDE, that allows language models to clearly separate instructions and data at the level of embeddings. ASIDE applies an orthogonal rotation to the embeddings of data tokens, thus creating clearly distinct representations of instructions and data tokens without introducing any additional parameters. As we demonstrate experimentally across a range of models, instruction-tuning LLMs with ASIDE (1) leads to highly increased instruction-data separation without a loss in model utility and (2) makes the models more robust to prompt injection benchmarks, even without dedicated safety training. Additionally, we provide insights into the mechanism underlying our method through an analysis of the model representations.

Some challenges in this process include the complicated nature of legal and technical texts, the need for model explanations, and limited access to assurance case data. We propose a compliance detection approach based on Natural Language Inference (NLI): EXplainable CompLiance detection with Argumentative Inference of Multi-hop reasoning (EXCLAIM). We formulate the claim-argument-evidence structure of an assurance case as a multi-hop inference for explainable and traceable compliance detection. We address the limited number of assurance cases by generating them using large language models (LLMs). We introduce metrics that measure the coverage and structural consistency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the generated assurance case from GDPR requirements in a multi-hop inference task as a case study. Our results highlight the potential of NLI-based approaches in automating the regulatory compliance process.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs) such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which uniformly adjust all token probabilities regardless of their relevance to preference, ConfPO focuses optimization on the most impactful tokens. This targeted approach improves alignment quality while mitigating overoptimization (i.e., reward hacking) by using the KL divergence budget more efficiently. In contrast to recent token-level methods that rely on credit-assignment models or AI annotators, raising concerns about scalability and reliability, ConfPO is simple, lightweight, and model-free. Experimental results on challenging alignment benchmarks, including AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard, demonstrate that ConfPO consistently outperforms uniform DAAs across various LLMs, delivering better alignment with zero additional computational overhead.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

However, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) still struggle with some seemingly straightforward visual tasks, such as counting and solving jigsaw puzzles. We argue that these tasks challenge the ability of visual-to-textual conversion, where MLLMs convert visual information perceived from the input scene, to textual information for further reasoning and generating the answer. If the complexity of the visual input is beyond the perceptual capability of the MLLMs, without decomposing this conversion process, simply scaling inference-time reasoning cannot solve the task because it repeatedly encounters the same perceptual bottleneck. We propose an approach, autonomous imagination, to enable MLLMs to iteratively modify visual inputs (e.g. isolating objects, rearranging puzzle pieces) into intermediate visual states, decomposing visual-to-textual conversion into closed-loop visual modification steps. We show that, without any retraining, MLLMs can now solve tasks initially beyond their perceptual capability, highlighting that closed-loop visual modification can be an effective way of decomposing the visual reasoning task into solvable substeps.

This has led to the development of several intelligent tutoring systems and learning assistants that use LLMs as back-ends with various degrees of engineering. In this study, we seek to compare human tutors with LLM tutors in terms of engagement, empathy, scaffolding, and conciseness. We ask human tutors to annotate and compare the performance of an LLM tutor with that of a human tutor in teaching grade-school math word problems on these qualities. We find that annotators with teaching experience perceive LLMs as showing higher performance than human tutors in all 4 metrics. The biggest advantage is in empathy, where 80% of our annotators prefer the LLM tutor more often than the human tutors. Our study paints a positive picture of LLMs as tutors and indicates that these models can be used to reduce the load on human teachers in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to BEA@ACL 2025</p></details> |

While initial forays showcase the potential of LLMs to enhance security research, they also raise critical ethical concerns regarding the dual-use of offensive security tooling. This paper analyzes a set of papers that leverage LLMs for offensive security, focusing on how ethical considerations are expressed and justified in their work. The goal is to assess the culture of AI in offensive security research regarding ethics communication, highlighting trends, best practices, and gaps in current discourse. We provide insights into how the academic community navigates the fine line between innovation and ethical responsibility. Particularly, our results show that 13 of 15 reviewed prototypes (86.6\%) mentioned ethical considerations and are thus aware of the potential dual-use of their research. Main motivation given for the research was allowing broader access to penetration-testing as well as preparing defenders for AI-guided attackers.</p></details> |  |

Existing detection methods, relying on heuristics or Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, often face limitations such as unsatisfactory performance. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have emerged as a resource-efficient approach for adapting LLMs to specific tasks, but their effectiveness for code smell detection remains underexplored. In this regard, this study evaluates state-of-the-art PEFT methods on both Small (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) for detecting four types of code smells: Complex Conditional, Complex Method, Feature Envy, and Data Class. Using high-quality and balanced datasets sourced from GitHub, we fine-tuned four SLMs and five LLMs with PEFT techniques, including prompt tuning, prefix tuning, LoRA, and (IA)3. Results show that PEFT methods achieve comparable or better performance than full fine-tuning while consuming less GPU memory. LLMs generally outperform SLMs on detecting certain smells (e.g., Complex Conditional), while SLMs do better on others (e.g., Data Class). Additionally, increasing training dataset size significantly boosted performance, while increasing trainable parameters did not. Our findings highlight PEFT methods as effective and scalable solutions, outperforming existing heuristic-based, DL-based, and In-Context Learning approaches for code smell detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 7 images, 11 tables, Manuscript revision submitted to a journal (2025)</p></details> |

However, we posit that typical reasoning traces contain many redundant tokens, incurring extraneous inference costs. Upon examination of the output distribution of current LLMs, we find evidence on their latent ability to reason more concisely, relative to their default behavior. To elicit this capability, we propose simple fine-tuning methods which leverage self-generated concise reasoning paths obtained by best-of-N sampling and few-shot conditioning, in task-specific settings. Our combined method achieves a 30% reduction in output tokens on average, across five model families on GSM8K and MATH, while maintaining average accuracy. By exploiting the fundamental stochasticity and in-context learning capabilities of LLMs, our self-training approach robustly elicits concise reasoning on a wide range of models, including those with extensive post-training.

While several techniques exist for inference optimization, output compression remains relatively unexplored, with only a few preliminary efforts addressing this aspect. In this work, we first benchmark 12 decoder-only LLMs across 5 datasets, revealing that these models often produce responses that are substantially longer than necessary. We then conduct a comprehensive quality assessment of LLM responses, formally defining six information categories present in LLM responses. We show that LLMs often tend to include redundant or additional information besides the minimal answer. To address this issue of long responses by LLMs, we explore several simple and intuitive prompt-engineering strategies. Empirical evaluation shows that appropriate prompts targeting length reduction and controlling information content can achieve significant energy optimization between 25-60\% by reducing the response length while preserving the quality of LLM responses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to appear at the ACL 2025 findings</p></details> |
| **[Mitigating Reward Over-optimization in Direct Alignment Algorithms with Importance Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08681v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs) such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have emerged as alternatives to the standard Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. However, these methods are more susceptible to over-optimization, in which the model drifts away from the reference policy, leading to degraded performance as training progresses. This paper proposes a novel importance-sampling approach to mitigate the over-optimization problem of offline DAAs. This approach, called (IS-DAAs), multiplies the DAA objective with an importance ratio that accounts for the reference policy distribution. IS-DAAs additionally avoid the high variance issue associated with importance sampling by clipping the importance ratio to a maximum value. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that IS-DAAs can effectively mitigate over-optimization, especially under low regularization strength, and achieve better performance than other methods designed to address this problem. Our implementations are provided publicly at this link.</p></details> | First version |

This work investigates the viability of leveraging large language models (LLMs) for hyperparameter optimization by fine-tuning a parameter-efficient version of Code Llama using LoRA. The adapted LLM is capable of generating accurate and efficient hyperparameter recommendations tailored to diverse neural network architectures. Unlike traditional approaches such as Optuna, which rely on computationally intensive trial-and-error procedures, our method achieves competitive or superior results in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) while significantly reducing computational overhead. Our findings demonstrate that LLM-based optimization not only matches the performance of state-of-the-art techniques like Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE) but also substantially accelerates the tuning process. This positions LLMs as a promising alternative for rapid experimentation, particularly in resource-constrained environments such as edge devices and mobile platforms, where computational efficiency is essential. In addition to improved efficiency, the method offers time savings and consistent performance across various tasks, highlighting its robustness and generalizability. All generated hyperparameters are included in the LEMUR Neural Network (NN) Dataset, which is publicly available and serves as an open-source benchmark for hyperparameter optimization research.</p></details> |  |

While large language models can generate fluent and coherent outputs, they lack the deep understanding and adaptive reasoning that characterize truly general intelligence. Existing evaluation frameworks, which are centered on broad language or perception tasks, fail to capture generality at its core and offer little guidance for incremental progress. To address this gap, this paper introduces the artificial general intelligence testbed (AGITB), a novel and freely available benchmarking suite comprising twelve fully automatable tests designed to evaluate low-level cognitive precursors through binary signal prediction. AGITB requires models to forecast temporal sequences without pretraining, symbolic manipulation, or semantic grounding. The framework isolates core computational invariants - such as determinism, sensitivity, and generalization - that align with principles of biological information processing. Engineered to resist brute-force and memorization-based approaches, AGITB presumes no prior knowledge and demands learning from first principles. While humans pass all tests, no current AI system has met the full AGITB criteria, underscoring its potential as a rigorous, interpretable, and actionable benchmark for guiding and evaluating progress toward artificial general intelligence.</p></details> | 15 pages |

However, SLMs' limited capacity restricts their reasoning capabilities and makes them sensitive to prompt variations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that enhances SLM reasoning capabilities through LLM generated blueprints. The blueprints provide structured, high-level reasoning guides that help SLMs systematically tackle related problems. Furthermore, our framework integrates a prompt template search mechanism to mitigate the SLMs' sensitivity to prompt variations. Our framework demonstrates improved SLM performance across various tasks, including math (GSM8K), coding (MBPP), and logic reasoning (BBH). Our approach improves the reasoning capabilities of SLMs without increasing model size or requiring additional training, offering a lightweight and deployment-friendly solution for on-device or resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>TTODL...</summary><p>TTODLer-FM Workshop@ICML'25 (Tiny Titans: The next wave of On-Device Learning for Foundational Models)</p></details> |

Our method leverages summarization with large language models (LLMs) to refine context before extracting relations via instruction-tuned generation. Preliminary results on a dedicated corpus show that summarization improves generative RE performance by reducing noise and guiding the model. However, BERT-based RE approaches still outperform generative models. This ongoing work demonstrates the potential of generative methods to support the study of specialized domains in low-resources setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[MEMETRON: Metaheuristic Mechanisms for Test-time Response Optimization of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08643v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for both open-ended and structured tasks, yet their inference-time behavior is still largely dictated by heuristic decoding strategies such as greedy search, sampling, or reranking. These methods provide limited control and do not explicitly optimize for task-specific objectives. We introduce MEMETRON, a task-agnostic framework that formulates LLM decoding as a discrete black-box optimization problem. MEMETRON leverages hybrid metaheuristic algorithms, GENETRON and ANNETRON, to search the response space, guided by reward models and contextual operations performed by the LLM itself. This approach enables efficient discovery of high-reward responses without requiring model retraining or gradient access. The framework is modular and generalizes across diverse tasks, requiring only a reward function and lightweight prompt templates. We evaluate our framework on the critical human preference alignment task and demonstrate that it significantly outperforms standard decoding and reranking methods, highlighting its potential to improve alignment without model retraining.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why Uncertainty Estimation Methods Fall Short in RAG: An Axiomatic Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07459v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are valued for their strong performance across various tasks, but they also produce inaccurate or misleading outputs. Uncertainty Estimation (UE) quantifies the model's confidence and helps users assess response reliability. However, existing UE methods have not been thoroughly examined in scenarios like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), where the input prompt includes non-parametric knowledge. This paper shows that current UE methods cannot reliably assess correctness in the RAG setting. We further propose an axiomatic framework to identify deficiencies in existing methods and guide the development of improved approaches. Our framework introduces five constraints that an effective UE method should meet after incorporating retrieved documents into the LLM's prompt. Experimental results reveal that no existing UE method fully satisfies all the axioms, explaining their suboptimal performance in RAG. We further introduce a simple yet effective calibration function based on our framework, which not only satisfies more axioms than baseline methods but also improves the correlation between uncertainty estimates and correctness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cracking the Code of Hallucination in LVLMs with Vision-aware Head Divergence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13949v3)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have made substantial progress in integrating large language models (LLMs) with visual inputs, enabling advanced multimodal reasoning. Despite their success, a persistent challenge is hallucination-where generated text fails to accurately reflect visual content-undermining both accuracy and reliability. Existing methods focus on alignment training or decoding refinements but primarily address symptoms at the generation stage without probing the underlying causes. In this work, we investigate the internal mechanisms driving hallucination in LVLMs, with an emphasis on the multi-head attention module. Specifically, we introduce Vision-aware Head Divergence (VHD), a metric that quantifies the sensitivity of attention head outputs to visual context. Based on this, our findings reveal the presence of vision-aware attention heads that are more attuned to visual information; however, the model's overreliance on its prior language patterns is closely related to hallucinations. Building on these insights, we propose Vision-aware Head Reinforcement (VHR), a training-free approach to mitigate hallucination by enhancing the role of vision-aware attention heads. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches in mitigating hallucinations, while maintaining high efficiency with negligible additional time overhead.</p></details> | ACL2025 |
| **[Leveraging LLMs to Evaluate Usefulness of Document](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08626v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The conventional Cranfield paradigm struggles to effectively capture user satisfaction due to its weak correlation between relevance and satisfaction, alongside the high costs of relevance annotation in building test collections. To tackle these issues, our research explores the potential of leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate multilevel usefulness labels for evaluation. We introduce a new user-centric evaluation framework that integrates users' search context and behavioral data into LLMs. This framework uses a cascading judgment structure designed for multilevel usefulness assessments, drawing inspiration from ordinal regression techniques. Our study demonstrates that when well-guided with context and behavioral information, LLMs can accurately evaluate usefulness, allowing our approach to surpass third-party labeling methods. Furthermore, we conduct ablation studies to investigate the influence of key components within the framework. We also apply the labels produced by our method to predict user satisfaction, with real-world experiments indicating that these labels substantially improve the performance of satisfaction prediction models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Fine-Tuning of Quantized Models via Adaptive Rank and Bitwidth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03802v3)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>QLoRA effectively combines low-bit quantization and LoRA to achieve memory-friendly fine-tuning for large language models (LLM). Recently, methods based on SVD for continuous update iterations to initialize LoRA matrices to accommodate quantization errors have generally failed to consistently improve performance. Dynamic mixed precision is a natural idea for continuously improving the fine-tuning performance of quantized models, but previous methods often optimize low-rank subspaces or quantization components separately, without considering their synergy. To address this, we propose \textbf{QR-Adaptor}, a unified, gradient-free strategy that uses partial calibration data to jointly search the quantization components and the rank of low-rank spaces for each layer, thereby continuously improving model performance. QR-Adaptor does not minimize quantization error but treats precision and rank allocation as a discrete optimization problem guided by actual downstream performance and memory usage. Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) quantized LoRA fine-tuning methods, our approach achieves a 4.89\% accuracy improvement on GSM8K, and in some cases even outperforms the 16-bit fine-tuned model while maintaining the memory footprint of the 4-bit setting.</p></details> | 24 pages, 5 figures |

Traditional RPA platforms often suffer from performance bottlenecks when handling high-volume repetitive processes like OCR, leading to a less efficient and more time-consuming process. LMRPA allows the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve the accuracy and readability of extracted text, overcoming the challenges posed by ambiguous characters and complex text structures.Extensive benchmarks were conducted comparing LMRPA to leading RPA platforms, including UiPath and Automation Anywhere, using OCR engines like Tesseract and DocTR. The results are that LMRPA achieves superior performance, cutting the processing times by up to 52\%. For instance, in Batch 2 of the Tesseract OCR task, LMRPA completed the process in 9.8 seconds, where UiPath finished in 18.1 seconds and Automation Anywhere finished in 18.7 seconds. Similar improvements were observed with DocTR, where LMRPA outperformed other automation tools conducting the same process by completing tasks in 12.7 seconds, while competitors took over 20 seconds to do the same. These findings highlight the potential of LMRPA to revolutionize OCR-driven automation processes, offering a more efficient and effective alternative solution to the existing state-of-the-art RPA models.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages , 1 figure , 1 algorithm</p></details> |

Yet, perhaps surprisingly, many widely deployed comparison-based preference learning models, including large language models, fail to have this guarantee. Until now, the only comparison-based preference learning algorithms that were proved to be monotone are the Generalized Bradley-Terry models. Yet, these models are unable to generalize to uncompared data. In this paper, we advance the understanding of the set of models with generalization ability that are monotone. Namely, we propose a new class of Linear Generalized Bradley-Terry models with Diffusion Priors, and identify sufficient conditions on alternatives' embeddings that guarantee monotonicity. Our experiments show that this monotonicity is far from being a general guarantee, and that our new class of generalizing models improves accuracy, especially when the dataset is limited.</p></details> |  |

Integrating advanced modelling techniques with large language models (LLMs) and formal verification in a logical style can significantly enhance this process. We propose a comprehensive framework that focuses on specific Unified Modelling Language (UML) diagrams for preliminary system development. This framework offers visualisations at various modelling stages and seamlessly integrates large language models and logical reasoning engines. The behavioural models generated with the assistance of LLMs are automatically translated into formal logical specifications. Deductive formal verification ensures that logical requirements and interrelations between software artefacts are thoroughly addressed. Ultimately, the framework facilitates the automatic generation of program skeletons, streamlining the transition from design to implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been peer-reviewed and accepted for publication to the 1st International Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Integrated Development Environments (AI-IDE) of the 33rd ACM Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE '25), June 23--27, 2025, Trondheim, Norway</p></details> |

Investigating the Role of Personas in Hate Speech Detection by Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08593v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hate speech detection is a socially sensitive and inherently subjective task, with judgments often varying based on personal traits. While prior work has examined how socio-demographic factors influence annotation, the impact of personality traits on Large Language Models (LLMs) remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study on the role of persona prompts in hate speech classification, focusing on MBTI-based traits. A human annotation survey confirms that MBTI dimensions significantly affect labeling behavior. Extending this to LLMs, we prompt four open-source models with MBTI personas and evaluate their outputs across three hate speech datasets. Our analysis uncovers substantial persona-driven variation, including inconsistencies with ground truth, inter-persona disagreement, and logit-level biases. These findings highlight the need to carefully define persona prompts in LLM-based annotation workflows, with implications for fairness and alignment with human values.</p></details> |  |

We introduce CounselBench, a large-scale benchmark developed with 100 mental health professionals to evaluate and stress-test LLMs in single-turn counseling. The first component, CounselBench-EVAL, contains 2,000 expert evaluations of responses from GPT-4, LLaMA 3, Gemini, and online human therapists to real patient questions. Each response is rated along six clinically grounded dimensions, with written rationales and span-level annotations. We find that LLMs often outperform online human therapists in perceived quality, but experts frequently flag their outputs for safety concerns such as unauthorized medical advice. Follow-up experiments show that LLM judges consistently overrate model responses and overlook safety issues identified by human experts. To probe failure modes more directly, we construct CounselBench-Adv, an adversarial dataset of 120 expert-authored counseling questions designed to trigger specific model issues. Evaluation across 2,880 responses from eight LLMs reveals consistent, model-specific failure patterns. Together, CounselBench establishes a clinically grounded framework for benchmarking and improving LLM behavior in high-stakes mental health settings.</p></details> |  |

Recent works have proposed examining the activations produced by an LLM at inference time to assess whether its answer to a question is correct. Some works claim that a "geometry of truth" can be learned from examples, in the sense that the activations that generate correct answers can be distinguished from those leading to mistakes with a linear classifier. In this work, we underline a limitation of these approaches: we observe that these "geometries of truth" are intrinsically task-dependent and fail to transfer across tasks. More precisely, we show that linear classifiers trained across distinct tasks share little similarity and, when trained with sparsity-enforcing regularizers, have almost disjoint supports. We show that more sophisticated approaches (e.g., using mixtures of probes and tasks) fail to overcome this limitation, likely because activation vectors commonly used to classify answers form clearly separated clusters when examined across tasks.</p></details> |  |

We present Self-Developing, a framework that enables LLMs to autonomously discover, implement, and refine their own improvement algorithms. Our approach employs an iterative cycle where a seed model generates algorithmic candidates as executable code, evaluates their effectiveness, and uses Direct Preference Optimization to recursively improve increasingly sophisticated improvement strategies. We demonstrate this framework through model merging, a practical technique for combining specialized models. Self-Developing successfully discovered novel merging algorithms that outperform existing human-designed algorithms. On mathematical reasoning benchmarks, the autonomously discovered algorithms improve the seed model's GSM8k performance by 6\% and exceed human-designed approaches like Task Arithmetic by 4.3\%. Remarkably, these algorithms exhibit strong generalization, achieving 7.4\% gains on out-of-domain models without re-optimization. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can transcend their training to invent genuinely novel optimization techniques. This capability represents a crucial step toward a new era where LLMs not only solve problems but autonomously develop the methodologies for their own advancement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NAACL 2025 (main)</p></details> |

State Manipulation is one of the notorious attacks in DeFi smart contracts, with price variable being the most commonly exploited state variable-attackers manipulate token prices to gain illicit profits. In this paper, we propose PriceSleuth, a novel method that leverages the Large Language Model (LLM) and static analysis to detect Price Manipulation (PM) attacks proactively. PriceSleuth firstly identifies core logic function related to price calculation in DeFi contracts. Then it guides LLM to locate the price calculation code statements. Secondly, PriceSleuth performs backward dependency analysis of price variables, instructing LLM in detecting potential price manipulation. Finally, PriceSleuth utilizes propagation analysis of price variables to assist LLM in detecting whether these variables are maliciously exploited. We presented preliminary experimental results to substantiate the effectiveness of PriceSleuth . And we outline future research directions for PriceSleuth.</p></details> |  |

While Chain-of-Thought prompting enhances performance via explicit intermediate steps, it suffers from sufficient token overhead and a fixed reasoning trajectory, preventing step-wise refinement. Recent advances in latent reasoning address these limitations by refining internal reasoning processes directly in the model's latent space, without producing explicit outputs. However, a key challenge remains: how to effectively update reasoning embeddings during post-training to guide the model toward more accurate solutions. To overcome this challenge, we propose a lightweight post-training framework that refines latent reasoning trajectories using two novel strategies: 1) Contrastive reasoning feedback, which compares reasoning embeddings against strong and weak baselines to infer effective update directions via embedding enhancement; 2) Residual embedding refinement, which stabilizes updates by progressively integrating current and historical gradients, enabling fast yet controlled convergence. Extensive experiments and case studies are conducted on five reasoning benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Notably, a 5\% accuracy gain on MathQA without additional training.</p></details> |  |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential, existing general-purpose models often lack the specialized domain knowledge, nuanced reasoning capabilities, and access to high-quality, domain-specific training data required for adapting a general LLM into an LLM specially for communication system formulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepForm, the first reasoning LLM specially for automated communication system formulation. We propose the world-first large-scale, open-source dataset meticulously curated for this domain called Communication System Formulation Reasoning Corpus (CSFRC). Our framework employs a two-stage training strategy: first, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data to distill domain knowledge; second, a novel rule-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm, C-ReMax based on ReMax, to cultivate advanced modeling capabilities and elicit sophisticated reasoning patterns like self-correction and verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming larger proprietary LLMs on diverse senerios. We will release related resources to foster further research in this area after the paper is accepted.</p></details> |  |

Reinforcement Learning (RL), a complementary paradigm, enables agents to autonomously optimize complex behaviors through interaction and reward signals. However, designing effective reward functions for RL remains challenging, especially in real-world tasks where sparse rewards are insufficient and dense rewards require elaborate design. In this work, we propose Autonomous Reinforcement learning for Complex Human-Informed Environments (ARCHIE), an unsupervised pipeline leveraging GPT-4, a pre-trained LLM, to generate reward functions directly from natural language task descriptions. The rewards are used to train RL agents in simulated environments, where we formalize the reward generation process to enhance feasibility. Additionally, GPT-4 automates the coding of task success criteria, creating a fully automated, one-shot procedure for translating human-readable text into deployable robot skills. Our approach is validated through extensive simulated experiments on single-arm and bi-manual manipulation tasks using an ABB YuMi collaborative robot, highlighting its practicality and effectiveness. Tasks are demonstrated on the real robot setup.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce BiasGuard, a novel bias detection tool that explicitly analyzes inputs and reasons through fairness specifications to provide accurate judgments. BiasGuard is implemented through a two-stage approach: the first stage initializes the model to explicitly reason based on fairness specifications, while the second stage leverages reinforcement learning to enhance its reasoning and judgment capabilities. Our experiments, conducted across five datasets, demonstrate that BiasGuard outperforms existing tools, improving accuracy and reducing over-fairness misjudgments. We also highlight the importance of reasoning-enhanced decision-making and provide evidence for the effectiveness of our two-stage optimization pipeline.</p></details> | ACL 2025 findings |

This growing deployment presents new challenges for UAV trajectory planning in complex urban environments. However, existing studies often overlook key factors, such as urban airspace constraints and economic efficiency, which are essential in low-altitude economy contexts. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is regarded as a promising solution to these issues, while its practical adoption remains limited by low learning efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel UAV trajectory planning framework that combines DRL with large language model (LLM) reasoning to enable safe, compliant, and economically viable path planning. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines across multiple metrics, including data collection rate, collision avoidance, successful landing, regulatory compliance, and energy efficiency. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach in addressing UAV trajectory planning key challenges under constraints of the low-altitude economy networking.</p></details> |  |
| **[FairMT-Bench: Benchmarking Fairness for Multi-turn Dialogue in Conversational LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19317v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing use of large language model (LLM)-based chatbots has raised concerns about fairness. Fairness issues in LLMs can lead to severe consequences, such as bias amplification, discrimination, and harm to marginalized communities. While existing fairness benchmarks mainly focus on single-turn dialogues, multi-turn scenarios, which in fact better reflect real-world conversations, present greater challenges due to conversational complexity and potential bias accumulation. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive fairness benchmark for LLMs in multi-turn dialogue scenarios, \textbf{FairMT-Bench}. Specifically, we formulate a task taxonomy targeting LLM fairness capabilities across three stages: context understanding, user interaction, and instruction trade-offs, with each stage comprising two tasks. To ensure coverage of diverse bias types and attributes, we draw from existing fairness datasets and employ our template to construct a multi-turn dialogue dataset, \texttt{FairMT-10K}. For evaluation, GPT-4 is applied, alongside bias classifiers including Llama-Guard-3 and human validation to ensure robustness. Experiments and analyses on \texttt{FairMT-10K} reveal that in multi-turn dialogue scenarios, current LLMs are more likely to generate biased responses, and there is significant variation in performance across different tasks and models. Based on this, we curate a challenging dataset, \texttt{FairMT-1K}, and test 15 current state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs on this dataset. The results show the current state of fairness in LLMs and showcase the utility of this novel approach for assessing fairness in more realistic multi-turn dialogue contexts, calling for future work to focus on LLM fairness improvement and the adoption of \texttt{FairMT-1K} in such efforts.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 spotlight |

In this work, we present ACORN, a framework that teaches LLMs physical awareness through sound, focusing on fundamental physical phenomena like the Doppler effect, multipath effect, and spatial relationships. To overcome data scarcity, ACORN introduce a physics-based simulator combining real-world sound sources with controlled physical channels to generate diverse training data. Using this simulator, we build AQA-PHY, a comprehensive Audio Question-Answer dataset, and propose an audio encoder that processes both magnitude and phase information. By connecting our audio encoder to state-of-the-art LLMs, we demonstrate reasonable results in both simulated and real-world tasks, such as line-of-sight detection, Doppler effect estimation, and Direction-of-Arrival estimation, paving the way for enabling LLMs to understand physical world.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

However, their effectiveness in medical applications remains limited due to the inherent discrepancies between data and tasks in medical scenarios and those in the general domain. Concretely, existing medical MLLMs face the following critical limitations: (1) limited coverage of medical knowledge beyond imaging, (2) heightened susceptibility to hallucinations due to suboptimal data curation processes, (3) lack of reasoning capabilities tailored for complex medical scenarios. To address these challenges, we first propose a comprehensive data curation procedure that (1) efficiently acquires rich medical knowledge data not only from medical imaging but also from extensive medical texts and general-domain data; and (2) synthesizes accurate medical captions, visual question answering (VQA), and reasoning samples. As a result, we build a multimodal dataset enriched with extensive medical knowledge. Building on the curated data, we introduce our medical-specialized MLLM: Lingshu. Lingshu undergoes multi-stage training to embed medical expertise and enhance its task-solving capabilities progressively. Besides, we preliminarily explore the potential of applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards paradigm to enhance Lingshu's medical reasoning ability. Additionally, we develop MedEvalKit, a unified evaluation framework that consolidates leading multimodal and textual medical benchmarks for standardized, fair, and efficient model assessment. We evaluate the performance of Lingshu on three fundamental medical tasks, multimodal QA, text-based QA, and medical report generation. The results show that Lingshu consistently outperforms the existing open-source multimodal models on most tasks ...</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report, 53 pages, 25 tables, and 16 figures</p></details> |
| **[Exploring the Escalation of Source Bias in User, Data, and Recommender System Feedback Loop](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17998v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems are essential for information access, allowing users to present their content for recommendation. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), AI-generated content (AIGC), primarily in the form of text, has become a central part of the content ecosystem. As AIGC becomes increasingly prevalent, it is important to understand how it affects the performance and dynamics of recommender systems. To this end, we construct an environment that incorporates AIGC to explore its short-term impact. The results from popular sequential recommendation models reveal that AIGC are ranked higher in the recommender system, reflecting the phenomenon of source bias. To further explore the long-term impact of AIGC, we introduce a feedback loop with realistic simulators. The results show that the model's preference for AIGC increases as the user clicks on AIGC rises and the model trains on simulated click data. This leads to two issues: In the short term, bias toward AIGC encourages LLM-based content creation, increasing AIGC content, and causing unfair traffic distribution. From a long-term perspective, our experiments also show that when AIGC dominates the content ecosystem after a feedback loop, it can lead to a decline in recommendation performance. To address these issues, we propose a debiasing method based on L1-loss optimization to maintain long-term content ecosystem balance. In a real-world environment with AIGC generated by mainstream LLMs, our method ensures a balance between AIGC and human-generated content in the ecosystem. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Yuqi-Zhou/Rec_SourceBias.</p></details> |  |

| **[Why Uncertainty Estimation Methods Fall Short in RAG: An Axiomatic Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07459v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are valued for their strong performance across various tasks, but they also produce inaccurate or misleading outputs. Uncertainty Estimation (UE) quantifies the model's confidence and helps users assess response reliability. However, existing UE methods have not been thoroughly examined in scenarios like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), where the input prompt includes non-parametric knowledge. This paper shows that current UE methods cannot reliably assess correctness in the RAG setting. We further propose an axiomatic framework to identify deficiencies in existing methods and guide the development of improved approaches. Our framework introduces five constraints that an effective UE method should meet after incorporating retrieved documents into the LLM's prompt. Experimental results reveal that no existing UE method fully satisfies all the axioms, explaining their suboptimal performance in RAG. We further introduce a simple yet effective calibration function based on our framework, which not only satisfies more axioms than baseline methods but also improves the correlation between uncertainty estimates and correctness.</p></details> |  |

Our benchmark contains 2366 questions of diverse complexity, dynamism, and topics, and includes over 35K annotated passages retrieved from both private document sets and the Web, to reflect real-world RAG use cases. This makes it an ideal test bed to evaluate an LLM's ability to identify only the relevant information necessary to compose a response, or provide a deflective response when there is insufficient information. Evaluations of multiple state-of-the-art LLMs on GaRAGe show that the models tend to over-summarise rather than (a) ground their answers strictly on the annotated relevant passages (reaching at most a Relevance-Aware Factuality Score of 60%), or (b) deflect when no relevant grounding is available (reaching at most 31% true positive rate in deflections). The F1 in attribution to relevant sources is at most 58.9%, and we show that performance is particularly reduced when answering time-sensitive questions and when having to draw knowledge from sparser private grounding sources.</p></details> | ACL 2025 (Findings) |

However, existing RAG approaches predominantly rely on flat, similarity-based retrieval that fails to leverage the rich relational structure inherent in user-item interactions. We introduce LlamaRec-LKG-RAG, a novel single-pass, end-to-end trainable framework that integrates personalized knowledge graph context into LLM-based recommendation ranking. Our approach extends the LlamaRec architecture by incorporating a lightweight user preference module that dynamically identifies salient relation paths within a heterogeneous knowledge graph constructed from user behavior and item metadata. These personalized subgraphs are seamlessly integrated into prompts for a fine-tuned Llama-2 model, enabling efficient and interpretable recommendations through a unified inference step. Comprehensive experiments on ML-100K and Amazon Beauty datasets demonstrate consistent and significant improvements over LlamaRec across key ranking metrics (MRR, NDCG, Recall). LlamaRec-LKG-RAG demonstrates the critical value of structured reasoning in LLM-based recommendations and establishes a foundation for scalable, knowledge-aware personalization in next-generation recommender systems. Code is available at~\href{https://github.com/VahidAz/LlamaRec-LKG-RAG}{repository}.</p></details> |  |
| **[MrM: Black-Box Membership Inference Attacks against Multimodal RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07399v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems enhance large vision-language models by integrating cross-modal knowledge, enabling their increasing adoption across real-world multimodal tasks. These knowledge databases may contain sensitive information that requires privacy protection. However, multimodal RAG systems inherently grant external users indirect access to such data, making them potentially vulnerable to privacy attacks, particularly membership inference attacks (MIAs). % Existing MIA methods targeting RAG systems predominantly focus on the textual modality, while the visual modality remains relatively underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose MrM, the first black-box MIA framework targeted at multimodal RAG systems. It utilizes a multi-object data perturbation framework constrained by counterfactual attacks, which can concurrently induce the RAG systems to retrieve the target data and generate information that leaks the membership information. Our method first employs an object-aware data perturbation method to constrain the perturbation to key semantics and ensure successful retrieval. Building on this, we design a counterfact-informed mask selection strategy to prioritize the most informative masked regions, aiming to eliminate the interference of model self-knowledge and amplify attack efficacy. Finally, we perform statistical membership inference by modeling query trials to extract features that reflect the reconstruction of masked semantics from response patterns. Experiments on two visual datasets and eight mainstream commercial visual-language models (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2) demonstrate that MrM achieves consistently strong performance across both sample-level and set-level evaluations, and remains robust under adaptive defenses.</p></details> |  |
| **[BRIGHT+: Upgrading the BRIGHT Benchmark with MARCUS, a Multi-Agent RAG Clean-Up Suite](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07116v1)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems require corpora that are both structurally clean and semantically coherent. BRIGHT is a recent and influential benchmark designed to evaluate complex multi-hop retrieval across diverse, high-reasoning domains. However, its practical effectiveness is limited by common web-crawled artifacts - such as content redundancy and semantic discontinuity - that impair retrieval accuracy and downstream reasoning. Notably, we find that such issues are concentrated in seven StackExchange-derived subdomains, while other domains (e.g., Coding and Theorem-based content) remain relatively clean. In this study, we present MARCUS, a multi-agent pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to systematically clean and re-chunk BRIGHT into a higher-quality corpus: BRIGHT-Plus. MARCUS applies dedicated agents for structural noise removal and semantic segmentation, preserving answer-bearing spans while improving contextual integrity. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that BRIGHT-Plus yields consistent and significant improvements in both retrieval accuracy and multi-hop reasoning across a diverse set of retrievers. We release both the BRIGHT-Plus corpus and the MARCUS pipeline to support future research on robust, reasoning-centric retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables.

While RDF/OWL reasoners enable graph-based reasoning, they are limited to fragments of first-order logic, preventing deeper temporal and semantic analysis. This paper addresses both challenges by developing automatic historical event extraction models using multiple LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Llama 3.2) with three enhancement strategies: pure base generation, knowledge graph enhancement, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). We conducted comprehensive evaluations using historical texts from Thucydides. Our findings reveal that enhancement strategies optimize different performance dimensions rather than providing universal improvements. For coverage and historical breadth, base generation achieves optimal performance with Claude and GPT-4 extracting comprehensive events. However, for precision, RAG enhancement improves coordinate accuracy and metadata completeness. Model architecture fundamentally determines enhancement sensitivity: larger models demonstrate robust baseline performance with incremental RAG improvements, while Llama 3.2 shows extreme variance from competitive performance to complete failure. We then developed an automated translation pipeline converting extracted RDF representations into Coq proof assistant specifications, enabling higher-order reasoning beyond RDF capabilities including multi-step causal verification, temporal arithmetic with BC dates, and formal proofs about historical causation. The Coq formalization validates that RAG-discovered event types represent legitimate domain-specific semantic structures rather than ontological violations.</p></details> |  |

However, they often suffer from inefficiency and rely on manually pre-defined query modes, limiting practical use. In this paper, we propose E^2GraphRAG, a streamlined graph-based RAG framework that improves both Efficiency and Effectiveness. During the indexing stage, E^2GraphRAG constructs a summary tree with large language models and an entity graph with SpaCy based on document chunks. We then construct bidirectional indexes between entities and chunks to capture their many-to-many relationships, enabling fast lookup during both local and global retrieval. For the retrieval stage, we design an adaptive retrieval strategy that leverages the graph structure to retrieve and select between local and global modes. Experiments show that E^2GraphRAG achieves up to 10 times faster indexing than GraphRAG and 100 times speedup over LightRAG in retrieval while maintaining competitive QA performance.</p></details> | 16 pages |

Many existing educational solutions rely on cloud-based infrastructure or proprietary tools, which are costly and may raise privacy concerns. Regulated industries with limited budgets require affordable, self-hosted solutions. We introduce an end-to-end, open-source framework leveraging small (3B-7B parameters), locally deployed LLMs for customized teaching material generation and assessment. Our system uniquely incorporates an interactive loop crucial for effective small-model refinement, and an auxiliary LLM verifier to mitigate jailbreaking risks, enhancing output reliability and safety. Utilizing Retrieval and Context Augmented Generation (RAG/CAG), it produces factually accurate, customized pedagogically-styled content. Deployed on-premises for data privacy and validated through an evaluation pipeline and a college physics pilot, our findings show that carefully engineered small LLM systems can offer robust, affordable, practical, and safe educator support, achieving utility comparable to larger models for targeted tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[ECoRAG: Evidentiality-guided Compression for Long Context RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05167v2)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in Open-Domain Question Answering (ODQA) by leveraging external documents through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To reduce RAG overhead, from longer context, context compression is necessary. However, prior compression methods do not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, which limit the performance in LLM-based RAG. We thus propose Evidentiality-guided RAG, or ECoRAG framework. ECoRAG improves LLM performance by compressing retrieved documents based on evidentiality, ensuring whether answer generation is supported by the correct evidence. As an additional step, ECoRAG reflects whether the compressed content provides sufficient evidence, and if not, retrieves more until sufficient. Experiments show that ECoRAG improves LLM performance on ODQA tasks, outperforming existing compression methods. Furthermore, ECoRAG is highly cost-efficient, as it not only reduces latency but also minimizes token usage by retaining only the necessary information to generate the correct answer. Code is available at https://github.com/ldilab/ECoRAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAGE: A Framework of Precise Retrieval for RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01713v3)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated significant proficiency in conducting question-answering (QA) tasks within a specified corpus. Nonetheless, numerous failure instances of RAG in QA still exist. These failures are not solely attributable to the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs); instead, they predominantly arise from the retrieval of inaccurate information for LLMs due to two limitations: (1) Current RAG methods segment the corpus without considering semantics, making it difficult to find relevant context due to impaired correlation between questions and the segments. (2) There is a trade-off between missing essential context with fewer context retrieved and getting irrelevant context with more context retrieved. In this paper, we introduce a RAG framework (SAGE), to overcome these limitations. First, to address the segmentation issue without considering semantics, we propose to train a semantic segmentation model. This model is trained to segment the corpus into semantically complete chunks. Second, to ensure that only the most relevant chunks are retrieved while the irrelevant ones are ignored, we design a chunk selection algorithm to dynamically select chunks based on the decreasing speed of the relevance score, leading to a more relevant selection. Third, to further ensure the precision of the retrieved chunks, we propose letting LLMs assess whether retrieved chunks are excessive or lacking and then adjust the amount of context accordingly. Experiments show that SAGE outperforms baselines by 61.25% in the quality of QA on average. Moreover, by avoiding retrieving noisy context, SAGE lowers the cost of the tokens consumed in LLM inference and achieves a 49.41% enhancement in cost efficiency on average. Additionally, our work offers valuable insights for boosting RAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[FinSage: A Multi-aspect RAG System for Financial Filings Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14493v3)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging large language models in real-world settings often entails a need to utilize domain-specific data and tools in order to follow the complex regulations that need to be followed for acceptable use. Within financial sectors, modern enterprises increasingly rely on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to address complex compliance requirements in financial document workflows. However, existing solutions struggle to account for the inherent heterogeneity of data (e.g., text, tables, diagrams) and evolving nature of regulatory standards used in financial filings, leading to compromised accuracy in critical information extraction. We propose the FinSage framework as a solution, utilizing a multi-aspect RAG framework tailored for regulatory compliance analysis in multi-modal financial documents. FinSage introduces three innovative components: (1) a multi-modal pre-processing pipeline that unifies diverse data formats and generates chunk-level metadata summaries, (2) a multi-path sparse-dense retrieval system augmented with query expansion (HyDE) and metadata-aware semantic search, and (3) a domain-specialized re-ranking module fine-tuned via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to prioritize compliance-critical content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FinSage achieves an impressive recall of 92.51% on 75 expert-curated questions derived from surpasses the best baseline method on the FinanceBench question answering datasets by 24.06% in accuracy. Moreover, FinSage has been successfully deployed as financial question-answering agent in online meetings, where it has already served more than 1,200 people.</p></details> |  |

It leverages graphs to model the hierarchical structure between specific concepts, enabling more coherent and effective knowledge retrieval for accurate reasoning.Despite its conceptual promise, recent studies report that GraphRAG frequently underperforms vanilla RAG on many real-world tasks. This raises a critical question: Is GraphRAG really effective, and in which scenarios do graph structures provide measurable benefits for RAG systems? To address this, we propose GraphRAG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate GraphRAG models onboth hierarchical knowledge retrieval and deep contextual reasoning. GraphRAG-Bench features a comprehensive dataset with tasks of increasing difficulty, coveringfact retrieval, complex reasoning, contextual summarization, and creative generation, and a systematic evaluation across the entire pipeline, from graph constructionand knowledge retrieval to final generation. Leveraging this novel benchmark, we systematically investigate the conditions when GraphRAG surpasses traditional RAG and the underlying reasons for its success, offering guidelines for its practical application. All related resources and analyses are collected for the community at https://github.com/GraphRAG-Bench/GraphRAG-Benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Head RAG: Solving Multi-Aspect Problems with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05085v3)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling the retrieval of documents into the LLM context to provide more accurate and relevant responses. Existing RAG solutions do not focus on queries that may require fetching multiple documents with substantially different contents. Such queries occur frequently, but are challenging because the embeddings of these documents may be distant in the embedding space, making it hard to retrieve them all. This paper introduces Multi-Head RAG (MRAG), a novel scheme designed to address this gap with a simple yet powerful idea: leveraging activations of Transformer's multi-head attention layer, instead of the decoder layer, as keys for fetching multi-aspect documents. The driving observation is that different attention heads learn to capture different data aspects. Harnessing the corresponding activations results in embeddings that represent various facets of data items and queries, improving the retrieval accuracy for complex queries. We provide an evaluation methodology and metrics, multi-aspect datasets, and real-world use cases to demonstrate MRAG's effectiveness. We show MRAG's design advantages over 18 RAG baselines, empirical improvements of up to 20% in retrieval success ratios, and benefits for downstream LLM generation. MRAG can be seamlessly integrated with existing RAG frameworks and benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

While traditional flight control relies on hardcoded equations, recent Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential for more flexible problem-solving but struggle with reliably selecting and applying correct mathematical formulations and executing precise multi-step arithmetic. We propose RAG-UAV, a retrieval-augmented generation framework designed to improve the mathematical reasoning of several LLMs (including GPT o1/Turbo, Llama-3.2/3.3, Mistral, and DeepSeek R1) in UAV-specific contexts by providing access to relevant domain literature. To conduct an initial assessment, we introduce the UAV-Math-Bench, a small problem set comprising 20 UAV-centric mathematical problems across four difficulty levels. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating retrieval substantially increases exact answer accuracy (achieving up to 75% with o1), reduces instances of incorrect formulation selection (from 25% without RAG to 5% with RAG), decreases numerical errors, reducing Mean Squared Error (MSE) by orders of magnitude for the best-performing models. This pilot study indicates that RAG can enable general-purpose LLMs to function as more reliable tools for engineering analysis, although direct real-time flight control requires further investigation and validation on a larger scale. All benchmark data, question and answer are publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures, 4 appendix subsections</p></details> |

However, RAG systems are highly sensitive to retrieval noise prevalent in real-world scenarios. Existing benchmarks fail to emulate the complex and heterogeneous noise distributions encountered in real-world retrieval environments, undermining reliable robustness assessment. In this paper, we define four categories of retrieval noise based on linguistic properties and noise characteristics, aiming to reflect the heterogeneity of noise in real-world scenarios. Building on this, we introduce Magic Mushroom, a benchmark for replicating "magic mushroom" noise: contexts that appear relevant on the surface but covertly mislead RAG systems. Magic Mushroom comprises 7,468 single-hop and 3,925 multi-hop question-answer pairs. More importantly, Magic Mushroom enables researchers to flexibly configure combinations of retrieval noise according to specific research objectives or application scenarios, allowing for highly controlled evaluation setups. We evaluate LLM generators of varying parameter scales and classic RAG denoising strategies under diverse noise distributions to investigate their performance dynamics during progressive noise encroachment. Our analysis reveals that both generators and denoising strategies have significant room for improvement and exhibit extreme sensitivity to noise distributions. Magic Mushroom emerges as a promising tool for evaluating and advancing noise-robust RAG systems, accelerating their widespread deployment in real-world applications.

Semantic variability across domains like medicine, networking, or law hampers RAG's context precision, while fine-tuning solutions are costly, slow, and lack generalization as new data emerges. Achieving zero-shot precision with retrievers without fine-tuning still remains a key challenge. We introduce 'MetaGen Blended RAG', a novel enterprise search approach that enhances semantic retrievers through a metadata generation pipeline and hybrid query indexes using dense and sparse vectors. By leveraging key concepts, topics, and acronyms, our method creates metadata-enriched semantic indexes and boosted hybrid queries, delivering robust, scalable performance without fine-tuning. On the biomedical PubMedQA dataset, MetaGen Blended RAG achieves 82% retrieval accuracy and 77% RAG accuracy, surpassing all prior zero-shot RAG benchmarks and even rivaling fine-tuned models on that dataset, while also excelling on datasets like SQuAD and NQ. This approach redefines enterprise search using a new approach to building semantic retrievers with unmatched generalization across specialized domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

We show that existing attacks are not designed to be stealthy, allowing reliable detection and mitigation. We formalize stealth using a distinguishability-based security game. If a few poisoned passages are designed to control the response, they must differentiate themselves from benign ones, inherently compromising stealth. This motivates the need for attackers to rigorously analyze intermediate signals involved in generation$\unicode{x2014}$such as attention patterns or next-token probability distributions$\unicode{x2014}$to avoid easily detectable traces of manipulation. Leveraging attention patterns, we propose a passage-level score$\unicode{x2014}$the Normalized Passage Attention Score$\unicode{x2014}$used by our Attention-Variance Filter algorithm to identify and filter potentially poisoned passages. This method mitigates existing attacks, improving accuracy by up to $\sim 20 \%$ over baseline defenses. To probe the limits of attention-based defenses, we craft stealthier adaptive attacks that obscure such traces, achieving up to $35 \%$ attack success rate, and highlight the challenges in improving stealth.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we propose Cross-source knowledge \textbf{Re}conciliation for Multimodal RAG (CoRe-MMRAG), a novel end-to-end framework that effectively reconciles inconsistencies across knowledge sources. CoRe-MMRAG follows a four-stage pipeline: it first generates an internal response from parametric knowledge, then selects the most relevant multimodal evidence via joint similarity assessment, generates an external response, and finally integrates both to produce a reliable answer. Additionally, a specialized training paradigm enhances knowledge source discrimination, multimodal integration, and unified answer generation. Experiments on KB-VQA benchmarks show that CoRe-MMRAG achieves substantial improvements over baseline methods, achieving 5.6% and 9.3% performance gains on InfoSeek and Encyclopedic-VQA, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 Main</p></details> |

However, for Indian languages, the development of high-quality RAG systems is hindered by the lack of two critical resources: (1) evaluation benchmarks for retrieval and generation tasks, and (2) large-scale training datasets for multilingual retrieval. Most existing benchmarks and datasets are centered around English or high-resource languages, making it difficult to extend RAG capabilities to the diverse linguistic landscape of India. To address the lack of evaluation benchmarks, we create IndicMSMarco, a multilingual benchmark for evaluating retrieval quality and response generation in 13 Indian languages, created via manual translation of 1000 diverse queries from MS MARCO-dev set. To address the need for training data, we build a large-scale dataset of (question, answer, relevant passage) tuples derived from the Wikipedias of 19 Indian languages using state-of-the-art LLMs. Additionally, we include translated versions of the original MS MARCO dataset to further enrich the training data and ensure alignment with real-world information-seeking tasks.

| **[KET-RAG: A Cost-Efficient Multi-Granular Indexing Framework for Graph-RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09304v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-RAG constructs a knowledge graph from text chunks to improve retrieval in Large Language Model (LLM)-based question answering. It is particularly useful in domains such as biomedicine, law, and political science, where retrieval often requires multi-hop reasoning over proprietary documents. Some existing Graph-RAG systems construct KNN graphs based on text chunk relevance, but this coarse-grained approach fails to capture entity relationships within texts, leading to sub-par retrieval and generation quality. To address this, recent solutions leverage LLMs to extract entities and relationships from text chunks, constructing triplet-based knowledge graphs. However, this approach incurs significant indexing costs, especially for large document collections. To ensure a good result accuracy while reducing the indexing cost, we propose KET-RAG, a multi-granular indexing framework. KET-RAG first identifies a small set of key text chunks and leverages an LLM to construct a knowledge graph skeleton. It then builds a text-keyword bipartite graph from all text chunks, serving as a lightweight alternative to a full knowledge graph. During retrieval, KET-RAG searches both structures: it follows the local search strategy of existing Graph-RAG systems on the skeleton while mimicking this search on the bipartite graph to improve retrieval quality. We evaluate 13 solutions on three real-world datasets, demonstrating that KET-RAG outperforms all competitors in indexing cost, retrieval effectiveness, and generation quality. Notably, it achieves comparable or superior retrieval quality to Microsoft's Graph-RAG while reducing indexing costs by over an order of magnitude. Additionally, it improves the generation quality by up to 32.4% while lowering indexing costs by around 20%.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAG4ITOps: A Supervised Fine-Tunable and Comprehensive RAG Framework for IT Operations and Maintenance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15805v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the ever-increasing demands on Question Answering (QA) systems for IT operations and maintenance, an efficient and supervised fine-tunable framework is necessary to ensure the data security, private deployment and continuous upgrading. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have notably improved the open-domain QA's performance, how to efficiently handle enterprise-exclusive corpora and build domain-specific QA systems are still less-studied for industrial applications. In this paper, we propose a general and comprehensive framework based on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and facilitate the whole business process of establishing QA systems for IT operations and maintenance. In accordance with the prevailing RAG method, our proposed framework, named with RAG4ITOps, composes of two major stages: (1) Models Fine-tuning \& Data Vectorization, and (2) Online QA System Process. At the Stage 1, we leverage a contrastive learning method with two negative sampling strategies to fine-tune the embedding model, and design the instruction templates to fine-tune the LLM with a Retrieval Augmented Fine-Tuning method. At the Stage 2, an efficient process of QA system is built for serving. We collect enterprise-exclusive corpora from the domain of cloud computing, and the extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior results than counterparts on two kinds of QA tasks. Our experiment also provide a case for applying the RAG4ITOps to real-world enterprise-level applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2024 Industry Track</p></details> |

We demonstrate that enhancing generative models' capacity to process noisy content is equally critical for robust performance. In this paper, we present KARE-RAG (Knowledge-Aware Refinement and Enhancement for RAG), which improves knowledge utilization through three key innovations: (1) structured knowledge representations that facilitate error detection during training, (2) Dense Direct Preference Optimization (DDPO)-a refined training objective that prioritizes correction of critical errors, and (3) a contrastive data generation pipeline that maintains semantic consistency while rectifying factual inaccuracies. Experiments show our method significantly enhances standard RAG pipelines across model scales, improving both in-domain and out-of-domain task performance without compromising general capabilities. Notably, these gains are achieved with modest training data, suggesting data-efficient optimization is possible through targeted learning strategies. Our findings establish a new direction for RAG improvement: by improving how models learn to process retrieved content, we can enhance performance across diverse inference paradigms. All data and code will be publicly available on Github.</p></details> |  |
| **[VRAG-RL: Empower Vision-Perception-Based RAG for Visually Rich Information Understanding via Iterative Reasoning with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22019v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effectively retrieving, reasoning and understanding visually rich information remains a challenge for RAG methods. Traditional text-based methods cannot handle visual-related information. On the other hand, current vision-based RAG approaches are often limited by fixed pipelines and frequently struggle to reason effectively due to the insufficient activation of the fundamental capabilities of models. As RL has been proven to be beneficial for model reasoning, we introduce VRAG-RL, a novel RL framework tailored for complex reasoning across visually rich information. With this framework, VLMs interact with search engines, autonomously sampling single-turn or multi-turn reasoning trajectories with the help of visual perception tokens and undergoing continual optimization based on these samples. Our approach highlights key limitations of RL in RAG domains: (i) Prior Multi-modal RAG approaches tend to merely incorporate images into the context, leading to insufficient reasoning token allocation and neglecting visual-specific perception; and (ii) When models interact with search engines, their queries often fail to retrieve relevant information due to the inability to articulate requirements, thereby leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we define an action space tailored for visually rich inputs, with actions including cropping and scaling, allowing the model to gather information from a coarse-to-fine perspective. Furthermore, to bridge the gap between users' original inquiries and the retriever, we employ a simple yet effective reward that integrates query rewriting and retrieval performance with a model-based reward. Our VRAG-RL optimizes VLMs for RAG tasks using specially designed RL strategies, aligning the model with real-world applications. The code is available at https://github.com/Alibaba-NLP/VRAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ranking Free RAG: Replacing Re-ranking with Selection in RAG for Sensitive Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16014v3)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines rely on similarity-based retrieval and re-ranking, which depend on heuristics such as top-k, and lack explainability, interpretability, and robustness against adversarial content. To address this gap, we propose a novel method METEORA that replaces re-ranking in RAG with a rationale-driven selection approach. METEORA operates in two stages. First, a general-purpose LLM is preference-tuned to generate rationales conditioned on the input query using direct preference optimization. These rationales guide the evidence chunk selection engine, which selects relevant chunks in three stages: pairing individual rationales with corresponding retrieved chunks for local relevance, global selection with elbow detection for adaptive cutoff, and context expansion via neighboring chunks. This process eliminates the need for top-k heuristics. The rationales are also used for consistency check using a Verifier LLM to detect and filter poisoned or misleading content for safe generation. The framework provides explainable and interpretable evidence flow by using rationales consistently across both selection and verification. Our evaluation across six datasets spanning legal, financial, and academic research domains shows that METEORA improves generation accuracy by 33.34% while using approximately 50% fewer chunks than state-of-the-art re-ranking methods. In adversarial settings, METEORA significantly improves the F1 score from 0.10 to 0.44 over the state-of-the-art perplexity-based defense baseline, demonstrating strong resilience to poisoning attacks.

However, large-scale RAG systems consume significant computational resources and are prone to generating hallucinated content from Humans. In this work, we introduce $\texttt{DRAG}$, a novel framework for distilling RAG knowledge from large-scale Language Models (LLMs) into small LMs (SLMs). Our approach leverages evidence- and knowledge graph-based distillation, ensuring that the distilled model retains critical factual knowledge while significantly reducing model size and computational cost. By aligning the smaller model's predictions with a structured knowledge graph and ranked evidence, $\texttt{DRAG}$ effectively mitigates hallucinations and improves factual accuracy. We further present a case demonstrating how our framework mitigates user privacy risks and introduce a corresponding benchmark. Experimental evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the prior competitive RAG methods like MiniRAG for SLMs by up to 27.7% using the same models, preserving high-level efficiency and reliability. With $\texttt{DRAG}$, we provide a practical and resource-efficient roadmap to deploying enhanced retrieval and generation capabilities in small-sized LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 Main.

However, discrepancies between these textbooks and the parametric knowledge inherent in Large Language Models (LLMs) can undermine the effectiveness of RAG systems. To systematically investigate RAG system robustness against such knowledge discrepancies, we introduce KnowShiftQA. This novel question answering dataset simulates these discrepancies by applying deliberate hypothetical knowledge updates to both answers and source documents, reflecting how textbook knowledge can shift. KnowShiftQA comprises 3,005 questions across five subjects, designed with a comprehensive question typology focusing on context utilization and knowledge integration. Our extensive experiments on retrieval and question answering performance reveal that most RAG systems suffer a substantial performance drop when faced with these knowledge discrepancies. Furthermore, questions requiring the integration of contextual (textbook) knowledge with parametric (LLM) knowledge pose a significant challenge to current LLMs.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Main |

A key challenge is designing AI methods that can incrementally extract, structure, and validate information while preserving hierarchical and contextual relationships. We introduce CDMizer, a template-driven, LLM, and RAG-based framework for structured text transformation. By leveraging depth-based retrieval and hierarchical generation, CDMizer ensures a controlled, modular process that aligns generated outputs with predefined schema. Its template-driven approach guarantees syntactic correctness, schema adherence, and improved scalability, addressing key limitations of direct generation methods. Additionally, we propose an LLM-powered evaluation framework to assess the completeness and accuracy of structured representations. Demonstrated in the transformation of Over-the-Counter (OTC) financial derivative contracts into the Common Domain Model (CDM), CDMizer establishes a scalable foundation for AI-driven document understanding, structured synthesis, and automated validation in broader contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

This paper presents an automated platform designed to streamline key aspects of LEED certification. The platform integrates a PySide6-based user interface, a review Manager for process orchestration, and multiple analysis engines for credit compliance, energy modeling via EnergyPlus, and location-based evaluation. Key components include an OpenCV-based preprocessing pipeline for document analysis and a report generation module powered by the Gemma3 large language model with a retrieval-augmented generation framework. Implementation techniques - including computer vision for document analysis, structured LLM prompt design, and RAG-based report generation - are detailed. Initial results from pilot project deployment show improvements in efficiency and accuracy compared to traditional manual workflows, achieving 82% automation coverage and up to 70% reduction in documentation time.

| **[Investigating Language Preference of Multilingual RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11175v4)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) systems enhance language models by integrating external multilingual information to produce context-aware responses. However, mRAG systems struggle with retrieving relevant information due to linguistic variations between queries and documents, generating inconsistent responses when multilingual sources conflict. In this work, we systematically investigate language preferences in both retrieval and generation of mRAG through a series of experiments. Our analysis indicates that retrievers tend to prefer high-resource and query languages, yet this preference does not consistently improve generation performance. Moreover, we observe that generators prefer the query language or Latin scripts, leading to inconsistent outputs. To overcome these issues, we propose Dual Knowledge Multilingual RAG (DKM-RAG), a simple yet effective framework that fuses translated multilingual passages with complementary model knowledge. Empirical results demonstrate that DKM-RAG mitigates language preference in generation and enhances performance across diverse linguistic settings.

While several studies have investigated RAG pipelines for high-resource languages, the optimization of RAG components for Arabic remains underexplored. This study presents a comprehensive empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art RAG components-including chunking strategies, embedding models, rerankers, and language models-across a diverse set of Arabic datasets. Using the RAGAS framework, we systematically compare performance across four core metrics: context precision, context recall, answer faithfulness, and answer relevancy. Our experiments demonstrate that sentence-aware chunking outperforms all other segmentation methods, while BGE-M3 and Multilingual-E5-large emerge as the most effective embedding models. The inclusion of a reranker (bge-reranker-v2-m3) significantly boosts faithfulness in complex datasets, and Aya-8B surpasses StableLM in generation quality. These findings provide critical insights for building high-quality Arabic RAG pipelines and offer practical guidelines for selecting optimal components across different document types.</p></details> |  |
| **[ORAN-GUIDE: RAG-Driven Prompt Learning for LLM-Augmented Reinforcement Learning in O-RAN Network Slicing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00576v1)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced wireless networks must support highly dynamic and heterogeneous service demands. Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture enables this flexibility by adopting modular, disaggregated components, such as the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC), Centralized Unit (CU), and Distributed Unit (DU), that can support intelligent control via machine learning (ML). While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a powerful tool for managing dynamic resource allocation and slicing, it often struggles to process raw, unstructured input like RF features, QoS metrics, and traffic trends. These limitations hinder policy generalization and decision efficiency in partially observable and evolving environments. To address this, we propose \textit{ORAN-GUIDE}, a dual-LLM framework that enhances multi-agent RL (MARL) with task-relevant, semantically enriched state representations. The architecture employs a domain-specific language model, ORANSight, pretrained on O-RAN control and configuration data, to generate structured, context-aware prompts. These prompts are fused with learnable tokens and passed to a frozen GPT-based encoder that outputs high-level semantic representations for DRL agents. This design adopts a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) style pipeline tailored for technical decision-making in wireless systems. Experimental results show that ORAN-GUIDE improves sample efficiency, policy convergence, and performance generalization over standard MARL and single-LLM baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pandora's Box or Aladdin's Lamp: A Comprehensive Analysis Revealing the Role of RAG Noise in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13533v4)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a crucial method for addressing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). While recent research has extended RAG models to complex noisy scenarios, these explorations often confine themselves to limited noise types and presuppose that noise is inherently detrimental to LLMs, potentially deviating from real-world retrieval environments and restricting practical applicability. In this paper, we define seven distinct noise types from a linguistic perspective and establish a Noise RAG Benchmark (NoiserBench), a comprehensive evaluation framework encompassing multiple datasets and reasoning tasks. Through empirical evaluation of eight representative LLMs with diverse architectures and scales, we reveal that these noises can be further categorized into two practical groups: noise that is beneficial to LLMs (aka beneficial noise) and noise that is harmful to LLMs (aka harmful noise). While harmful noise generally impairs performance, beneficial noise may enhance several aspects of model capabilities and overall performance. Our analysis offers insights for developing more robust, adaptable RAG solutions and mitigating hallucinations across diverse retrieval scenarios.

| **[Astute RAG: Overcoming Imperfect Retrieval Augmentation and Knowledge Conflicts for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07176v2)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval augmented generation (RAG), while effectively integrating external knowledge to address the inherent limitations of large language models (LLMs), can be hindered by imperfect retrieval that contain irrelevant, misleading, or even malicious information. Previous studies have rarely connected the behavior of RAG through joint analysis, particularly regarding error propagation coming from imperfect retrieval and potential conflicts between LLMs' internal knowledge and external sources. Through comprehensive and controlled analyses under realistic conditions, we find that imperfect retrieval augmentation is inevitable, common, and harmful. We identify the knowledge conflicts between LLM-internal and external knowledge from retrieval as a bottleneck to overcome imperfect retrieval in the post-retrieval stage of RAG. To address this, we propose Astute RAG, a novel RAG approach designed to be resilient to imperfect retrieval augmentation. It adaptively elicits essential information from LLMs' internal knowledge, iteratively consolidates internal and external knowledge with source-awareness, and finalizes the answer according to information reliability. Our experiments with Gemini and Claude demonstrate the superior performance of Astute RAG compared to previous robustness-enhanced RAG approaches. Specifically, Astute RAG is the only RAG method that achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing conventional use of LLMs under the worst-case scenario. Further analysis reveals the effectiveness of Astute RAG in resolving knowledge conflicts, thereby improving the trustworthiness of RAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 main conference</p></details> |
| **[ComposeRAG: A Modular and Composable RAG for Corpus-Grounded Multi-Hop Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00232v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are increasingly diverse, yet many suffer from monolithic designs that tightly couple core functions like query reformulation, retrieval, reasoning, and verification. This limits their interpretability, systematic evaluation, and targeted improvement, especially for complex multi-hop question answering. We introduce ComposeRAG, a novel modular abstraction that decomposes RAG pipelines into atomic, composable modules. Each module, such as Question Decomposition, Query Rewriting, Retrieval Decision, and Answer Verification, acts as a parameterized transformation on structured inputs/outputs, allowing independent implementation, upgrade, and analysis. To enhance robustness against errors in multi-step reasoning, ComposeRAG incorporates a self-reflection mechanism that iteratively revisits and refines earlier steps upon verification failure. Evaluated on four challenging multi-hop QA benchmarks, ComposeRAG consistently outperforms strong baselines in both accuracy and grounding fidelity. Specifically, it achieves up to a 15% accuracy improvement over fine-tuning-based methods and up to a 5% gain over reasoning-specialized pipelines under identical retrieval conditions. Crucially, ComposeRAG significantly enhances grounding: its verification-first design reduces ungrounded answers by over 10% in low-quality retrieval settings, and by approximately 3% even with strong corpora. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the modular architecture, demonstrating distinct and additive contributions from each component. These findings underscore ComposeRAG's capacity to deliver flexible, transparent, scalable, and high-performing multi-hop reasoning with improved grounding and interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[REIC: RAG-Enhanced Intent Classification at Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00210v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate intent classification is critical for efficient routing in customer service, ensuring customers are connected with the most suitable agents while reducing handling times and operational costs. However, as companies expand their product lines, intent classification faces scalability challenges due to the increasing number of intents and variations in taxonomy across different verticals. In this paper, we introduce REIC, a Retrieval-augmented generation Enhanced Intent Classification approach, which addresses these challenges effectively. REIC leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to dynamically incorporate relevant knowledge, enabling precise classification without the need for frequent retraining. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that REIC outperforms traditional fine-tuning, zero-shot, and few-shot methods in large-scale customer service settings. Our results highlight its effectiveness in both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, demonstrating its potential for real-world deployment in adaptive and large-scale intent classification systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[The RAG Paradox: A Black-Box Attack Exploiting Unintentional Vulnerabilities in Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20995v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing adoption of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, various attack methods have been proposed to degrade their performance. However, most existing approaches rely on unrealistic assumptions in which external attackers have access to internal components such as the retriever. To address this issue, we introduce a realistic black-box attack based on the RAG paradox, a structural vulnerability arising from the system's effort to enhance trust by revealing both the retrieved documents and their sources to users. This transparency enables attackers to observe which sources are used and how information is phrased, allowing them to craft poisoned documents that are more likely to be retrieved and upload them to the identified sources. Moreover, as RAG systems directly provide retrieved content to users, these documents must not only be retrievable but also appear natural and credible to maintain user confidence in the search results. Unlike prior work that focuses solely on improving document retrievability, our attack method explicitly considers both retrievability and user trust in the retrieved content. Both offline and online experiments demonstrate that our method significantly degrades system performance without internal access, while generating natural-looking poisoned documents.</p></details> |  |

A robust benchmark dataset must satisfy three key criteria: quality, diversity, and difficulty, which capturing the complexity of reasoning based on hops and the distribution of supporting evidence. In this paper, we propose MHTS (Multi-Hop Tree Structure), a novel dataset synthesis framework that systematically controls multi-hop reasoning complexity by leveraging a multi-hop tree structure to generate logically connected, multi-chunk queries. Our fine-grained difficulty estimation formula exhibits a strong correlation with the overall performance metrics of a RAG system, validating its effectiveness in assessing both retrieval and answer generation capabilities. By ensuring high-quality, diverse, and difficulty-controlled queries, our approach enhances RAG evaluation and benchmarking capabilities.</p></details> |  |

However, despite their widespread use, popular datasets such as WebQSP and CWQ suffer from critical quality issues, including inaccurate or incomplete ground-truth annotations, poorly constructed questions that are ambiguous, trivial, or unanswerable, and outdated or inconsistent knowledge. Through a manual audit of 16 popular KGQA datasets, including WebQSP and CWQ, we find that the average factual correctness rate is only 57 %. To address these issues, we introduce KGQAGen, an LLM-in-the-loop framework that systematically resolves these pitfalls. KGQAGen combines structured knowledge grounding, LLM-guided generation, and symbolic verification to produce challenging and verifiable QA instances. Using KGQAGen, we construct KGQAGen-10k, a ten-thousand scale benchmark grounded in Wikidata, and evaluate a diverse set of KG-RAG models. Experimental results demonstrate that even state-of-the-art systems struggle on this benchmark, highlighting its ability to expose limitations of existing models. Our findings advocate for more rigorous benchmark construction and position KGQAGen as a scalable framework for advancing KGQA evaluation.</p></details> | 9 pages |

Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods attempt to address this by retrieving globally relevant images, but they fail when no single image contains all desired elements from a complex user query. We propose Cross-modal RAG, a novel framework that decomposes both queries and images into sub-dimensional components, enabling subquery-aware retrieval and generation. Our method introduces a hybrid retrieval strategy - combining a sub-dimensional sparse retriever with a dense retriever - to identify a Pareto-optimal set of images, each contributing complementary aspects of the query. During generation, a multimodal large language model is guided to selectively condition on relevant visual features aligned to specific subqueries, ensuring subquery-aware image synthesis. Extensive experiments on MS-COCO, Flickr30K, WikiArt, CUB, and ImageNet-LT demonstrate that Cross-modal RAG significantly outperforms existing baselines in both retrieval and generation quality, while maintaining high efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[DocReRank: Single-Page Hard Negative Query Generation for Training Multi-Modal RAG Rerankers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22584v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rerankers play a critical role in multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by refining ranking of an initial set of retrieved documents. Rerankers are typically trained using hard negative mining, whose goal is to select pages for each query which rank high, but are actually irrelevant. However, this selection process is typically passive and restricted to what the retriever can find in the available corpus, leading to several inherent limitations. These include: limited diversity, negative examples which are often not hard enough, low controllability, and frequent false negatives which harm training. Our paper proposes an alternative approach: Single-Page Hard Negative Query Generation, which goes the other way around. Instead of retrieving negative pages per query, we generate hard negative queries per page. Using an automated LLM-VLM pipeline, and given a page and its positive query, we create hard negatives by rephrasing the query to be as similar as possible in form and context, yet not answerable from the page. This paradigm enables fine-grained control over the generated queries, resulting in diverse, hard, and targeted negatives. It also supports efficient false negative verification. Our experiments show that rerankers trained with data generated using our approach outperform existing models and significantly improve retrieval performance.</p></details> |  |

However, current LLM-based evaluation frameworks predominantly rely on directly prompting resource-intensive models with complex multi-stage prompts, underutilizing models' reasoning capabilities and introducing significant computational cost. In this paper, we present RAG-Zeval (RAG-Zero Evaluator), a novel end-to-end framework that formulates faithfulness and correctness evaluation as a rule-guided reasoning task. Our approach trains evaluators with reinforcement learning, facilitating compact models to generate comprehensive and sound assessments with detailed explanation in one-pass. We introduce a ranking-based outcome reward mechanism, using preference judgments rather than absolute scores, to address the challenge of obtaining precise pointwise reward signals. To this end, we synthesize the ranking references by generating quality-controlled responses with zero human annotation. Experiments demonstrate RAG-Zeval's superior performance, achieving the strongest correlation with human judgments and outperforming baselines that rely on LLMs with 10-100 times more parameters. Our approach also exhibits superior interpretability in response evaluation.</p></details> |  |

However, existing VLM often generate inaccurate answers due to a lack of up-to-date knowledge. To address this issue, recent research has introduced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, commonly used in Large Language Models (LLM), into VLM, incorporating external multi-modal knowledge to enhance the accuracy and practicality of VLM systems. Nevertheless, the RAG in LLM may be susceptible to data poisoning attacks. RAG-based VLM may also face the threat of this attack. This paper first reveals the vulnerabilities of the RAG-based large model under poisoning attack, showing that existing single-modal RAG poisoning attacks have a 100\% failure rate in multi-modal RAG scenarios. To address this gap, we propose Spa-VLM (Stealthy Poisoning Attack on RAG-based VLM), a new paradigm for poisoning attacks on large models. We carefully craft malicious multi-modal knowledge entries, including adversarial images and misleading text, which are then injected into the RAG's knowledge base. When users access the VLM service, the system may generate misleading outputs. We evaluate Spa-VLM on two Wikipedia datasets and across two different RAGs. Results demonstrate that our method achieves highly stealthy poisoning, with the attack success rate exceeding 0.8 after injecting just 5 malicious entries into knowledge bases with 100K and 2M entries, outperforming state-of-the-art poisoning attacks designed for RAG-based LLMs. Additionally, we evaluated several defense mechanisms, all of which ultimately proved ineffective against Spa-VLM, underscoring the effectiveness and robustness of our attack.</p></details> |  |

Given the vast number of proteins involved, this process remains time-consuming and challenging. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks have supported Target ID; however, no benchmark currently exists for identifying the biological impacts of PPIs. To bridge this gap, we introduce the RAG Benchmark for PPIs (RAGPPI), a factual question-answer benchmark of 4,420 question-answer pairs that focus on the potential biological impacts of PPIs. Through interviews with experts, we identified criteria for a benchmark dataset, such as a type of QA and source. We built a gold-standard dataset (500 QA pairs) through expert-driven data annotation. We developed an ensemble auto-evaluation LLM that reflected expert labeling characteristics, which facilitates the construction of a silver-standard dataset (3,720 QA pairs). We are committed to maintaining RAGPPI as a resource to support the research community in advancing RAG systems for drug discovery QA solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 4 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

To improve the robustness of such systems against noisy retrievals, Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning (RAFT) has emerged as a widely adopted method. However, RAFT conditions models to generate answers even in the absence of reliable knowledge. This behavior undermines their reliability in high-stakes domains, where acknowledging uncertainty is critical. To address this issue, we propose Divide-Then-Align (DTA), a post-training approach designed to endow RAG systems with the ability to respond with "I don't know" when the query is out of the knowledge boundary of both the retrieved passages and the model's internal knowledge. DTA divides data samples into four knowledge quadrants and constructs tailored preference data for each quadrant, resulting in a curated dataset for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that DTA effectively balances accuracy with appropriate abstention, enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of retrieval-augmented systems.</p></details> | ACL 2025 main |

In real-world scenarios, user questions often require retrieving answers that are distributed across multiple tables. GraphRAG has recently attracted much attention for enhancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities by organizing external knowledge to address ad-hoc and complex questions, exemplifying a promising direction for cross-table question answering. In this paper, to address the current gap in available data, we first introduce a multi-table benchmark, MutliTableQA, comprising 60k tables and 25k user queries collected from real-world sources. Then, we propose the first Graph-Table-RAG framework, namely GTR, which reorganizes table corpora into a heterogeneous graph, employs a hierarchical coarse-to-fine retrieval process to extract the most relevant tables, and integrates graph-aware prompting for downstream LLMs' tabular reasoning. Extensive experiments show that GTR exhibits superior cross-table question-answering performance while maintaining high deployment efficiency, demonstrating its real-world practical applicability.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |

To bridge this gap, we propose DoctorRAG, a RAG framework that emulates doctor-like reasoning by integrating both explicit clinical knowledge and implicit case-based experience. DoctorRAG enhances retrieval precision by first allocating conceptual tags for queries and knowledge sources, together with a hybrid retrieval mechanism from both relevant knowledge and patient. In addition, a Med-TextGrad module using multi-agent textual gradients is integrated to ensure that the final output adheres to the retrieved knowledge and patient query. Comprehensive experiments on multilingual, multitask datasets demonstrate that DoctorRAG significantly outperforms strong baseline RAG models and gains improvements from iterative refinements. Our approach generates more accurate, relevant, and comprehensive responses, taking a step towards more doctor-like medical reasoning systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

A plethora of things in human life, such as lifestyle, health, and food are dependent on the environment and agriculture. It comes under our responsibility to support the environment as well as agriculture. However, traditional farming practices often result in inefficient resource use and environmental challenges. To address these issues, precision agriculture has emerged as a promising approach that leverages advanced technologies to optimise agricultural processes. In this work, a hybrid approach is proposed that combines the three different potential fields of model AI: object detection, large language model (LLM), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). In this novel framework, we have tried to combine the vision and language models to work together to identify potential diseases in the tree leaf. This study introduces a novel AI-based precision agriculture system that uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide context-aware diagnoses and natural language processing (NLP) and YOLOv8 for crop disease detection. The system aims to tackle major issues with large language models (LLMs), especially hallucinations and allows for adaptive treatment plans and real-time disease detection. The system provides an easy-to-use interface to the farmers, which they can use to detect the different diseases related to coffee leaves by just submitting the image of the affected leaf the model will detect the diseases as well as suggest potential remediation methodologies which aim to lower the use of pesticides, preserving livelihoods, and encouraging environmentally friendly methods. With an emphasis on scalability, dependability, and user-friendliness, the project intends to improve RAG-integrated object detection systems for wider agricultural applications in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>There...</summary><p>There are 14 pages, 8 figures</p></details> |

To address this, we propose Debate-Augmented RAG (DRAG), a training-free framework that integrates Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) mechanisms into both retrieval and generation stages. In retrieval, DRAG employs structured debates among proponents, opponents, and judges to refine retrieval quality and ensure factual reliability. In generation, DRAG introduces asymmetric information roles and adversarial debates, enhancing reasoning robustness and mitigating factual inconsistencies. Evaluations across multiple tasks demonstrate that DRAG improves retrieval reliability, reduces RAG-induced hallucinations, and significantly enhances overall factual accuracy.

This study explores whether a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach using only the most relevant text segments can match the performance of processing entire clinical notes with large context LLMs. We begin by splitting clinical documents into smaller chunks, converting them into vector embeddings, and storing these in a FAISS index. We then retrieve the top 4,000 words most pertinent to the classification query and feed these consolidated segments into an LLM. We evaluated three LLMs (GPT4o, LLaMA, and Mistral) on a surgical complication identification task. Metrics such as AUC ROC, precision, recall, and F1 showed no statistically significant differences between the RAG based approach and whole-text processing (p > 0.05p > 0.05). These findings indicate that RAG can significantly reduce token usage without sacrificing classification accuracy, providing a scalable and cost effective solution for analyzing lengthy clinical documents.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing RAG research in finance focuses predominantly on textual data, overlooking the rich visual content in financial documents, resulting in the loss of key analytical insights. To bridge this gap, we present FinRAGBench-V, a comprehensive visual RAG benchmark tailored for finance which effectively integrates multimodal data and provides visual citation to ensure traceability. It includes a bilingual retrieval corpus with 60,780 Chinese and 51,219 English pages, along with a high-quality, human-annotated question-answering (QA) dataset spanning heterogeneous data types and seven question categories. Moreover, we introduce RGenCite, an RAG baseline that seamlessly integrates visual citation with generation. Furthermore, we propose an automatic citation evaluation method to systematically assess the visual citation capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Extensive experiments on RGenCite underscore the challenging nature of FinRAGBench-V, providing valuable insights for the development of multimodal RAG systems in finance.</p></details> |  |

VoxRAG employs silence-aware segmentation, speaker diarization, CLAP audio embeddings, and FAISS retrieval using L2-normalized cosine similarity. We construct a 50-query test set recorded as spoken input by a native English speaker. Retrieval quality was evaluated using LLM-as-a-judge annotations. For very relevant segments, cosine similarity achieved a Recall@10 of 0.34. For somewhat relevant segments, Recall@10 rose to 0.60 and nDCG@10 to 0.27, highlighting strong topical alignment. Answer quality was judged on a 0--2 scale across relevance, accuracy, completeness, and precision, with mean scores of 0.84, 0.58, 0.56, and 0.46 respectively. While precision and retrieval quality remain key limitations, VoxRAG shows that transcription-free speech-to-speech retrieval is feasible in RAG systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 Workshop MAGMaR</p></details> |

This is essential for adapting pedagogical agents to students' learning and problem-solving skills in STEM+C settings. While large language models (LLMs) facilitate dynamic pedagogical interactions, potential hallucinations can undermine confidence, trust, and instructional value. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) grounds LLM outputs in curated knowledge, but its effectiveness depends on clear semantic links between user input and a knowledge base, which are often weak in student dialogue. We propose log-contextualized RAG (LC-RAG), which enhances RAG retrieval by incorporating environment logs to contextualize collaborative discourse. Our findings show that LC-RAG improves retrieval over a discourse-only baseline and allows our collaborative peer agent, Copa, to deliver relevant, personalized guidance that supports students' critical thinking and epistemic decision-making in a collaborative computational modeling environment, XYZ.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) Workshop on Epistemics and Decision-Making in AI-Supported Education</p></details> |

A large enough context ensures that the relevant information is present in the input context for the LLM, but also incorporates irrelevant content that has been shown to confuse the models. On the other hand, a smaller context reduces the irrelevant information, but it often comes at the risk of losing important information necessary to answer the input question. This duality is especially challenging to manage for complex queries that contain little information to retrieve the relevant chunks from the full context. To address this, we present a novel framework, called FB-RAG, which enhances the RAG pipeline by relying on a combination of backward lookup (overlap with the query) and forward lookup (overlap with candidate reasons and answers) to retrieve specific context chunks that are the most relevant for answering the input query. Our evaluations on 9 datasets from two leading benchmarks show that FB-RAG consistently outperforms RAG and Long Context baselines developed recently for these benchmarks. We further show that FB-RAG can improve performance while reducing latency. We perform qualitative analysis of the strengths and shortcomings of our approach, providing specific insights to guide future work.</p></details> |  |

To overcome the limitations of existing methods, this paper shifts away from prior dedicated heuristic approaches and revisits the most fundamental idea to HR perception by enhancing the long-context capability of MLLMs, driven by recent advances in long-context techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for general LLMs. Towards this end, this paper presents the first study exploring the use of RAG to address HR perception challenges. Specifically, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Perception (RAP), a training-free framework that retrieves and fuses relevant image crops while preserving spatial context using the proposed Spatial-Awareness Layout. To accommodate different tasks, the proposed Retrieved-Exploration Search (RE-Search) dynamically selects the optimal number of crops based on model confidence and retrieval scores. Experimental results on HR benchmarks demonstrate the significant effectiveness of RAP, with LLaVA-v1.5-13B achieving a 43% improvement on $V^*$ Bench and 19% on HR-Bench.</p></details> |  |

At Volvo Construction Equipment (VCE), customer personas have traditionally been developed through qualitative methods, which are time-consuming and lack scalability. The main objective of this paper is to generate synthetic customer personas and integrate them into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot to support decision-making in business processes. To this end, we first focus on developing a persona-based RAG chatbot integrated with verified personas. Next, synthetic personas are generated using Few-Shot and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting techniques and evaluated based on completeness, relevance, and consistency using McNemar's test. In the final step, the chatbot's knowledge base is augmented with synthetic personas and additional segment information to assess improvements in response accuracy and practical utility. Key findings indicate that Few-Shot prompting outperformed CoT in generating more complete personas, while CoT demonstrated greater efficiency in terms of response time and token usage. After augmenting the knowledge base, the average accuracy rating of the chatbot increased from 5.88 to 6.42 on a 10-point scale, and 81.82% of participants found the updated system useful in business contexts.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional RAG systems are limited by static workflows and lack the adaptability required for multistep reasoning and complex task management. To address these limitations, agentic RAG systems (e.g., DeepResearch) have been proposed, enabling dynamic retrieval strategies, iterative context refinement, and adaptive workflows for handling complex search queries beyond the capabilities of conventional RAG. Recent advances, such as Search-R1, have demonstrated promising gains using outcome-based reinforcement learning, where the correctness of the final answer serves as the reward signal. Nevertheless, such outcome-supervised agentic RAG methods face challenges including low exploration efficiency, gradient conflict, and sparse reward signals. To overcome these challenges, we propose to utilize fine-grained, process-level rewards to improve training stability, reduce computational costs, and enhance efficiency. Specifically, we introduce a novel method ReasonRAG that automatically constructs RAG-ProGuide, a high-quality dataset providing process-level rewards for (i) query generation, (ii) evidence extraction, and (iii) answer generation, thereby enhancing model inherent capabilities via process-supervised reinforcement learning. With the process-level policy optimization, the proposed framework empowers LLMs to autonomously invoke search, generate queries, extract relevant evidence, and produce final answers. Compared to existing approaches such as Search-R1 and traditional RAG systems, ReasonRAG, leveraging RAG-ProGuide, achieves superior performance on five benchmark datasets using only 5k training instances, significantly fewer than the 90k training instances required by Search-R1.</p></details> |  |

A Fact-Checking Dataset for Evaluating the Robustness of RAG Against Misleading Retrievals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16101v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has shown impressive capabilities in mitigating hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs struggle to handle misleading retrievals and often fail to maintain their own reasoning when exposed to conflicting or selectively-framed evidence, making them vulnerable to real-world misinformation. In such real-world retrieval scenarios, misleading and conflicting information is rampant, particularly in the political domain, where evidence is often selectively framed, incomplete, or polarized. However, existing RAG benchmarks largely assume a clean retrieval setting, where models succeed by accurately retrieving and generating answers from gold-standard documents. This assumption fails to align with real-world conditions, leading to an overestimation of RAG system performance. To bridge this gap, we introduce RAGuard, a fact-checking dataset designed to evaluate the robustness of RAG systems against misleading retrievals. Unlike prior benchmarks that rely on synthetic noise, our dataset constructs its retrieval corpus from Reddit discussions, capturing naturally occurring misinformation. It categorizes retrieved evidence into three types: supporting, misleading, and irrelevant, providing a realistic and challenging testbed for assessing how well RAG systems navigate different retrieval information. Our benchmark experiments reveal that when exposed to misleading retrievals, all tested LLM-powered RAG systems perform worse than their zero-shot baselines (i.e., no retrieval at all), highlighting their susceptibility to noisy environments. To the best of our knowledge, RAGuard is the first benchmark to systematically assess RAG robustness against misleading evidence. We expect this benchmark will drive future research toward improving RAG systems beyond idealized datasets, making them more reliable for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

To analyze these scenarios comprehensively, we construct the Trustworthiness Response Dataset (TRD) with 36,266 questions spanning four RAG settings. We reveal that existing approaches address isolated scenarios-prioritizing one knowledge source, naively merging both, or refusing answers-but lack a unified framework to handle different real-world conditions simultaneously. Therefore, we propose the BRIDGE framework, which dynamically determines a comprehensive response strategy of large language models (LLMs). BRIDGE leverages an adaptive weighting mechanism named soft bias to guide knowledge collection, followed by a Maximum Soft-bias Decision Tree to evaluate knowledge and select optimal response strategies (trust internal/external knowledge, or refuse). Experiments show BRIDGE outperforms baselines by 5-15% in accuracy while maintaining balanced performance across all scenarios. Our work provides an effective solution for LLMs' trustworthy responses in real-world RAG applications.</p></details> | 24 pages, 8 figures |

Existing extraction methods typically rely on malicious inputs such as prompt injection or jailbreaking, making them easily detectable via input- or output-level detection. In this paper, we introduce Implicit Knowledge Extraction Attack (IKEA), which conducts knowledge extraction on RAG systems through benign queries. IKEA first leverages anchor concepts to generate queries with the natural appearance, and then designs two mechanisms to lead to anchor concept thoroughly 'explore' the RAG's privacy knowledge: (1) Experience Reflection Sampling, which samples anchor concepts based on past query-response patterns to ensure the queries' relevance to RAG documents; (2) Trust Region Directed Mutation, which iteratively mutates anchor concepts under similarity constraints to further exploit the embedding space. Extensive experiments demonstrate IKEA's effectiveness under various defenses, surpassing baselines by over 80% in extraction efficiency and 90% in attack success rate. Moreover, the substitute RAG system built from IKEA's extractions consistently outperforms those based on baseline methods across multiple evaluation tasks, underscoring the significant privacy risk in RAG systems.</p></details> |  |

A Comparative Study on LCMs-based Code Completion in Industry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15179v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code completion, a crucial practice in industrial settings, helps developers improve programming efficiency by automatically suggesting code snippets during development. With the emergence of Large Code Models (LCMs), this field has witnessed significant advancements. Due to the natural differences between open-source and industrial codebases, such as coding patterns and unique internal dependencies, it is a common practice for developers to conduct domain adaptation when adopting LCMs in industry. There exist multiple adaptation approaches, among which retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and fine-tuning are the two most popular paradigms. However, no prior research has explored the trade-off of the two approaches in industrial scenarios. To mitigate the gap, we comprehensively compare the two paradigms including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Fine-tuning (FT), for industrial code completion in this paper. In collaboration with Tencent's WXG department, we collect over 160,000 internal C++ files as our codebase. We then compare the two types of adaptation approaches from three dimensions that are concerned by industrial practitioners, including effectiveness, efficiency, and parameter sensitivity, using six LCMs. Our findings reveal that RAG, when implemented with appropriate embedding models that map code snippets into dense vector representations, can achieve higher accuracy than fine-tuning alone. Specifically, BM25 presents superior retrieval effectiveness and efficiency among studied RAG methods. Moreover, RAG and fine-tuning are orthogonal and their combination leads to further improvement. We also observe that RAG demonstrates better scalability than FT, showing more sustained performance gains with larger scales of codebase.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in FSE 25 Industry Track</p></details> |

However, existing RAG systems often suffer from imprecise retrieval, incomplete context coverage under constrained windows, and fragmented information from suboptimal context construction. We introduce Multi-scale Adaptive Context RAG (MacRAG), a hierarchical RAG framework that compresses and partitions documents into coarse-to-fine granularities, then adaptively merges relevant contexts through real-time chunk- and document-level expansions. By initiating with finest-level retrieval and progressively incorporating broader, higher-level context, MacRAG constructs effective query-specific long contexts, optimizing both precision and coverage. Evaluations on challenging LongBench expansions of HotpotQA, 2WikiMultihopQA, and Musique confirm MacRAG consistently surpasses baseline RAG pipelines in single- and multi-step generation using Llama-3.1-8B, Gemini-1.5-pro, and GPT-4o. Our results establish MacRAG as an efficient, scalable solution for real-world long-context, multi-hop reasoning. Our code is available at https://github.com/Leezekun/MacRAG.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches often rely on monolithic graph retrieval, incurring unnecessary latency for simple queries and fragmented reasoning for complex multi-hop questions. To address these challenges, this paper propose SPLIT-RAG, a multi-agent RAG framework that addresses these limitations with question-driven semantic graph partitioning and collaborative subgraph retrieval. The innovative framework first create Semantic Partitioning of Linked Information, then use the Type-Specialized knowledge base to achieve Multi-Agent RAG. The attribute-aware graph segmentation manages to divide knowledge graphs into semantically coherent subgraphs, ensuring subgraphs align with different query types, while lightweight LLM agents are assigned to partitioned subgraphs, and only relevant partitions are activated during retrieval, thus reduce search space while enhancing efficiency. Finally, a hierarchical merging module resolves inconsistencies across subgraph-derived answers through logical verifications. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates considerable improvements compared to existing approaches.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |

This study presents a novel multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation-based framework that automates anomaly detection across various Additive Manufacturing processes leveraging retrieved information from literature, including images and descriptive text, rather than training datasets. This framework integrates text and image retrieval from scientific literature and multimodal generation models to perform zero-shot anomaly identification, classification, and explanation generation in a Laser Powder Bed Fusion setting. The proposed framework is evaluated on four L-PBF manufacturing datasets from Oak Ridge National Laboratory, featuring various printer makes, models, and materials. This evaluation demonstrates the framework's adaptability and generalizability across diverse images without requiring additional training. Comparative analysis using Qwen2-VL-2B and GPT-4o-mini as MLLM within the proposed framework highlights that GPT-4o-mini outperforms Qwen2-VL-2B and proportional random baseline in manufacturing anomalies classification. Additionally, the evaluation of the RAG system confirms that incorporating retrieval mechanisms improves average accuracy by 12% by reducing the risk of hallucination and providing additional information. The proposed framework can be continuously updated by integrating emerging research, allowing seamless adaptation to the evolving landscape of AM technologies. This scalable, automated, and zero-shot-capable framework streamlines AM anomaly analysis, enhancing efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>ASME ...</summary><p>ASME 2025 International Design Engineering Technical Conferences and Computers and Information in Engineering Conference IDETC/CIE2025, August 17-20, 2025, Anaheim, CA (IDETC2025-168615)</p></details> |

We observe that for different queries, it could retrieve similar subgraphs as prompts, and thus we propose SubGCache, which aims to reduce inference latency by reusing computation across queries with similar structural prompts (i.e., subgraphs). Specifically, SubGCache clusters queries based on subgraph embeddings, constructs a representative subgraph for each cluster, and pre-computes the key-value (KV) cache of the representative subgraph. For each query with its retrieved subgraph within a cluster, it reuses the pre-computed KV cache of the representative subgraph of the cluster without computing the KV tensors again for saving computation. Experiments on two new datasets across multiple LLM backbones and graph-based RAG frameworks demonstrate that SubGCache consistently reduces inference latency with comparable and even improved generation quality, achieving up to 6.68$\times$ reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT).</p></details> |  |
| **[Effective and Transparent RAG: Adaptive-Reward Reinforcement Learning for Decision Traceability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13258v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly improved the performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive domains. However, although RAG achieved successes across distinct domains, there are still some unsolved challenges: 1) Effectiveness. Existing research mainly focuses on developing more powerful RAG retrievers, but how to enhance the generator's (LLM's) ability to utilize the retrieved information for reasoning and generation? 2) Transparency. Most RAG methods ignore which retrieved content actually contributes to the reasoning process, resulting in a lack of interpretability and visibility. To address this, we propose ARENA (Adaptive-Rewarded Evidence Navigation Agent), a transparent RAG generator framework trained via reinforcement learning (RL) with our proposed rewards. Based on the structured generation and adaptive reward calculation, our RL-based training enables the model to identify key evidence, perform structured reasoning, and generate answers with interpretable decision traces. Applied to Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, abundant experiments with various RAG baselines demonstrate that our model achieves 10-30% improvements on all multi-hop QA datasets, which is comparable with the SOTA Commercially-developed LLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1, DeepSeek-R1). Further analyses show that ARENA has strong flexibility to be adopted on new datasets without extra training. Our models and codes are publicly released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating the Performance of RAG Methods for Conversational AI in the Airport Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13006v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Airports from the top 20 in terms of annual passengers are highly dynamic environments with thousands of flights daily, and they aim to increase the degree of automation. To contribute to this, we implemented a Conversational AI system that enables staff in an airport to communicate with flight information systems. This system not only answers standard airport queries but also resolves airport terminology, jargon, abbreviations, and dynamic questions involving reasoning. In this paper, we built three different Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods, including traditional RAG, SQL RAG, and Knowledge Graph-based RAG (Graph RAG). Experiments showed that traditional RAG achieved 84.84% accuracy using BM25 + GPT-4 but occasionally produced hallucinations, which is risky to airport safety. In contrast, SQL RAG and Graph RAG achieved 80.85% and 91.49% accuracy respectively, with significantly fewer hallucinations. Moreover, Graph RAG was especially effective for questions that involved reasoning. Based on our observations, we thus recommend SQL RAG and Graph RAG are better for airport environments, due to fewer hallucinations and the ability to handle dynamic questions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NAACL 2025 industry track</p></details> |
| **[AMAQA: A Metadata-based QA Dataset for RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13557v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are widely used in question-answering (QA) tasks, but current benchmarks lack metadata integration, hindering evaluation in scenarios requiring both textual data and external information. To address this, we present AMAQA, a new open-access QA dataset designed to evaluate tasks combining text and metadata. The integration of metadata is especially important in fields that require rapid analysis of large volumes of data, such as cybersecurity and intelligence, where timely access to relevant information is critical. AMAQA includes about 1.1 million English messages collected from 26 public Telegram groups, enriched with metadata such as timestamps, topics, emotional tones, and toxicity indicators, which enable precise and contextualized queries by filtering documents based on specific criteria. It also includes 450 high-quality QA pairs, making it a valuable resource for advancing research on metadata-driven QA and RAG systems. To the best of our knowledge, AMAQA is the first single-hop QA benchmark to incorporate metadata and labels such as topics covered in the messages. We conduct extensive tests on the benchmark, establishing a new standard for future research. We show that leveraging metadata boosts accuracy from 0.12 to 0.61, highlighting the value of structured context. Building on this, we explore several strategies to refine the LLM input by iterating over provided context and enriching it with noisy documents, achieving a further 3-point gain over the best baseline and a 14-point improvement over simple metadata filtering. The dataset is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AMAQA-5D0D/</p></details> |  |
| **[Know3-RAG: A Knowledge-aware RAG Framework with Adaptive Retrieval, Generation, and Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12662v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to impressive progress in natural language generation, yet their tendency to produce hallucinated or unsubstantiated content remains a critical concern. To improve factual reliability, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates external knowledge during inference. However, existing RAG systems face two major limitations: (1) unreliable adaptive control due to limited external knowledge supervision, and (2) hallucinations caused by inaccurate or irrelevant references. To address these issues, we propose Know3-RAG, a knowledge-aware RAG framework that leverages structured knowledge from knowledge graphs (KGs) to guide three core stages of the RAG process, including retrieval, generation, and filtering. Specifically, we introduce a knowledge-aware adaptive retrieval module that employs KG embedding to assess the confidence of the generated answer and determine retrieval necessity, a knowledge-enhanced reference generation strategy that enriches queries with KG-derived entities to improve generated reference relevance, and a knowledge-driven reference filtering mechanism that ensures semantic alignment and factual accuracy of references. Experiments on multiple open-domain QA benchmarks demonstrate that Know3-RAG consistently outperforms strong baselines, significantly reducing hallucinations and enhancing answer reliability.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAGXplain: From Explainable Evaluation to Actionable Guidance of RAG Pipelines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13538v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems show promise by coupling large language models with external knowledge, yet traditional RAG evaluation methods primarily report quantitative scores while offering limited actionable guidance for refining these complex pipelines. In this paper, we introduce RAGXplain, an evaluation framework that quantifies RAG performance and translates these assessments into clear insights that clarify the workings of its complex, multi-stage pipeline and offer actionable recommendations. Using LLM reasoning, RAGXplain converts raw scores into coherent narratives identifying performance gaps and suggesting targeted improvements. By providing transparent explanations for AI decision-making, our framework fosters user trust-a key challenge in AI adoption. Our LLM-based metric assessments show strong alignment with human judgments, and experiments on public question-answering datasets confirm that applying RAGXplain's actionable recommendations measurably improves system performance. RAGXplain thus bridges quantitative evaluation and practical optimization, empowering users to understand, trust, and enhance their AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAGSynth: Synthetic Data for Robust and Faithful RAG Component Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10989v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RAG can enhance the performance of LLMs on knowledge-intensive tasks. Various RAG paradigms, including vanilla, planning-based, and iterative RAG, are built upon 2 cores: the retriever, which should robustly select relevant documents across complex queries, and the generator, which should faithfully synthesize responses. However, existing retrievers rely heavily on public knowledge and struggle with queries of varying logical complexity and clue completeness, while generators frequently face fidelity problems. In this work, we introduce RAGSynth, a framework that includes a data construction modeling and a corresponding synthetic data generation implementation, designed to optimize retriever robustness and generator fidelity. Additionally, we present SynthBench, a benchmark encompassing 8 domain-specific documents across 4 domains, featuring diverse query complexities, clue completeness, and fine-grained citation granularity. Leveraging RAGSynth, we generate a large-scale synthetic dataset, including single and multi-hop. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the synthetic data significantly improves the robustness of the retrievers and the fidelity of the generators. Additional evaluations confirm that RAGSynth can also generalize well across different domains. By integrating the optimized retrievers into various RAG paradigms, we consistently observe enhanced RAG system performance. We have open-sourced the implementation on https://github.com/EachSheep/RAGSynth.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Automated Situation Awareness: A RAG-Based Framework for Peacebuilding Reports](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10586v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Timely and accurate situation awareness is vital for decision-making in humanitarian response, conflict monitoring, and early warning and early action. However, the manual analysis of vast and heterogeneous data sources often results in delays, limiting the effectiveness of interventions. This paper introduces a dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that autonomously generates situation awareness reports by integrating real-time data from diverse sources, including news articles, conflict event databases, and economic indicators. Our system constructs query-specific knowledge bases on demand, ensuring timely, relevant, and accurate insights. To ensure the quality of generated reports, we propose a three-level evaluation framework that combines semantic similarity metrics, factual consistency checks, and expert feedback. The first level employs automated NLP metrics to assess coherence and factual accuracy. The second level involves human expert evaluation to verify the relevance and completeness of the reports. The third level utilizes LLM-as-a-Judge, where large language models provide an additional layer of assessment to ensure robustness. The system is tested across multiple real-world scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing coherent, insightful, and actionable reports. By automating report generation, our approach reduces the burden on human analysts and accelerates decision-making processes. To promote reproducibility and further research, we openly share our code and evaluation tools with the community via GitHub.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAG-Enabled Intent Reasoning for Application-Network Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09339v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intent-based network (IBN) is a promising solution to automate network operation and management. IBN aims to offer human-tailored network interaction, allowing the network to communicate in a way that aligns with the network users' language, rather than requiring the network users to understand the technical language of the network/devices. Nowadays, different applications interact with the network, each with its own specialized needs and domain language. Creating semantic languages (i.e., ontology-based languages) and associating them with each application to facilitate intent translation lacks technical expertise and is neither practical nor scalable. To tackle the aforementioned problem, we propose a context-aware AI framework that utilizes machine reasoning (MR), retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and generative AI technologies to interpret intents from different applications and generate structured network intents. The proposed framework allows for generalized/domain-specific intent expression and overcomes the drawbacks of large language models (LLMs) and vanilla-RAG framework. The experimental results show that our proposed intent-RAG framework outperforms the LLM and vanilla-RAG framework in intent translation.</p></details> |  |

Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a promising method for improving multistep reasoning by guiding models through intermediate steps. However, CoT alone does not fully address the hallucination problem. In this work, we investigate how combining CoT with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), as well as applying self-consistency and self-verification strategies, can reduce hallucinations and improve factual accuracy. By incorporating external knowledge sources during reasoning and enabling models to verify or revise their own outputs, we aim to generate more accurate and coherent responses. We present a comparative evaluation of baseline LLMs against CoT, CoT+RAG, self-consistency, and self-verification techniques. Our results highlight the effectiveness of each method and identify the most robust approach for minimizing hallucinations while preserving fluency and reasoning depth.</p></details> |  |

By combining structured knowledge graphs with contextually enriched text segments, Graph RAG offers a promising solution to address the inherent complexity and vast volume of legal data. The integration of hierarchical structure and temporal evolution into knowledge graphs - along with the concept of comprehensive Text Units - facilitates the construction of richer, interconnected representations of legal knowledge. Through a detailed analysis of Graph RAG and its application to legal norm datasets, this article aims to advance the field of Artificial Intelligence applied to Law, creating opportunities for more effective systems in legal research, legislative analysis, and decision support.</p></details> |  |

This study explores the application of RAG-enhanced LLMs coupled with pathology foundation models for thyroid cytology diagnosis, addressing challenges in cytological interpretation, standardization, and diagnostic accuracy. By leveraging a curated knowledge base, RAG facilitates dy-namic retrieval of relevant case studies, diagnostic criteria, and expert interpreta-tion, improving the contextual understanding of LLMs. Meanwhile, pathology foun-dation models, trained on high-resolution pathology images, refine feature extrac-tion and classification capabilities. The fusion of these AI-driven approaches en-hances diagnostic consistency, reduces variability, and supports pathologists in dis-tinguishing benign from malignant thyroid lesions. Our results demonstrate that integrating RAG with pathology-specific LLMs significantly improves diagnostic efficiency and interpretability, paving the way for AI-assisted thyroid cytopathology, with foundation model UNI achieving AUC 0.73-0.93 for correct prediction of surgi-cal pathology diagnosis from thyroid cytology samples.</p></details> |  |
| **[KAQG: A Knowledge-Graph-Enhanced RAG for Difficulty-Controlled Question Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07618v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>KAQG introduces a decisive breakthrough for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by explicitly tackling the two chronic weaknesses of current pipelines: transparent multi-step reasoning and fine-grained cognitive difficulty control. This transforms RAG from a passive retriever into an accountable generator of calibrated exam items. Technically, the framework fuses knowledge graphs, RAG retrieval, and educational assessment theory into a single pipeline. Domain passages are parsed into a structured graph; graph-aware retrieval feeds fact chains to an LLM; and an assessment layer governed by Bloom's Taxonomy levels and Item Response Theory (IRT) transforms those chains into psychometrically sound questions. This cross-disciplinary marriage yields two scholarly contributions: it shows how semantic graph contexts guide LLM reasoning paths, and it operationalizes difficulty metrics within the generation process, producing items whose IRT parameters match expert benchmarks. Every module, from KG construction scripts to the multi-agent reasoning scheduler and the automatic IRT validator, is openly released on GitHub. This enables peer laboratories to replicate experiments, benchmark against baselines, and extend individual components without licensing barriers. Its reproducible design paves the way for rigorous ablation studies, cross-domain transfer experiments, and shared leaderboards on multi-step reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Specifically by looking at the requirements engineering for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in expert settings. Through a case study at a maritime service provider, we demonstrate how data scientists face a fundamental tension between user expectations of AI perfection and the correctness of the generated outputs. Our findings reveal that data scientists must identify context-specific "retrieval requirements" through iterative experimentation together with users because they are the ones who can determine correctness. We present an empirical process model describing how data scientists practically elicited these "retrieval requirements" and managed system limitations. This work advances software engineering knowledge by providing insights into the specialized requirements engineering processes for implementing RAG systems in complex domain-specific applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EASE 2025, 17-20 June, Istanbul, Turkey</p></details> |
| **[The Distracting Effect: Understanding Irrelevant Passages in RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06914v1)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A well-known issue with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is that retrieved passages that are irrelevant to the query sometimes distract the answer-generating LLM, causing it to provide an incorrect response. In this paper, we shed light on this core issue and formulate the distracting effect of a passage w.r.t. a query (and an LLM). We provide a quantifiable measure of the distracting effect of a passage and demonstrate its robustness across LLMs. Our research introduces novel methods for identifying and using hard distracting passages to improve RAG systems. By fine-tuning LLMs with these carefully selected distracting passages, we achieve up to a 7.5% increase in answering accuracy compared to counterparts fine-tuned on conventional RAG datasets. Our contribution is two-fold: first, we move beyond the simple binary classification of irrelevant passages as either completely unrelated vs. distracting, and second, we develop and analyze multiple methods for finding hard distracting passages. To our knowledge, no other research has provided such a comprehensive framework for identifying and utilizing hard distracting passages.</p></details> |  |
| **[VR-RAG: Open-vocabulary Species Recognition with RAG-Assisted Large Multi-Modal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05635v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary recognition remains a challenging problem in computer vision, as it requires identifying objects from an unbounded set of categories. This is particularly relevant in nature, where new species are discovered every year. In this work, we focus on open-vocabulary bird species recognition, where the goal is to classify species based on their descriptions without being constrained to a predefined set of taxonomic categories. Traditional benchmarks like CUB-200-2011 and Birdsnap have been evaluated in a closed-vocabulary paradigm, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios where novel species continually emerge. We show that the performance of current systems when evaluated under settings closely aligned with open-vocabulary drops by a huge margin. To address this gap, we propose a scalable framework integrating structured textual knowledge from Wikipedia articles of 11,202 bird species distilled via GPT-4o into concise, discriminative summaries. We propose Visual Re-ranking Retrieval-Augmented Generation(VR-RAG), a novel, retrieval-augmented generation framework that uses visual similarities to rerank the top m candidates retrieved by a set of multimodal vision language encoders. This allows for the recognition of unseen taxa. Extensive experiments across five established classification benchmarks show that our approach is highly effective. By integrating VR-RAG, we improve the average performance of state-of-the-art Large Multi-Modal Model QWEN2.5-VL by 15.4% across five benchmarks. Our approach outperforms conventional VLM-based approaches, which struggle with unseen species. By bridging the gap between encyclopedic knowledge and visual recognition, our work advances open-vocabulary recognition, offering a flexible, scalable solution for biodiversity monitoring and ecological research.</p></details> | 7 figures |

This includes the LLM, embedding, and ranker models themselves, as well as hyperparameters governing individual RAG components. Yet, collectively optimizing the entire configuration in a RAG or LLM system remains under-explored - especially in multi-objective settings - due to intractably large solution spaces, noisy objective evaluations, and the high cost of evaluations. In this work, we introduce the first approach for multi-objective parameter optimization of cost, latency, safety and alignment over entire LLM and RAG systems. We find that Bayesian optimization methods significantly outperform baseline approaches, obtaining a superior Pareto front on two new RAG benchmark tasks. We conclude our work with important considerations for practitioners who are designing multi-objective RAG systems, highlighting nuances such as how optimal configurations may not generalize across tasks and objectives.</p></details> |  |

However, even when provided context, LLMs still frequently introduce unsupported information or contradictions. This paper presents our efforts to measure LLM hallucinations with a focus on summarization tasks, assessing how often various LLMs introduce hallucinations when summarizing documents. We discuss Vectara's existing LLM hallucination leaderboard, based on the Hughes Hallucination Evaluation Model (HHEM). While HHEM and Vectara's Hallucination Leaderboard have garnered great research interest, we examine challenges faced by HHEM and current hallucination detection methods by analyzing the effectiveness of these methods on existing hallucination datasets. To address these limitations, we propose FaithJudge, an LLM-as-a-judge approach guided by few-shot human hallucination annotations, which substantially improves automated LLM hallucination evaluation over current methods. We introduce an enhanced hallucination leaderboard centered on FaithJudge, alongside our current hallucination leaderboard, enabling more reliable benchmarking of LLMs for hallucinations in RAG.</p></details> |  |

Adaptive retrieval aims to retrieve only when necessary, but existing approaches rely on LLM-based uncertainty estimation, which remain inefficient and impractical. In this study, we introduce lightweight LLM-independent adaptive retrieval methods based on external information. We investigated 27 features, organized into 7 groups, and their hybrid combinations. We evaluated these methods on 6 QA datasets, assessing the QA performance and efficiency. The results show that our approach matches the performance of complex LLM-based methods while achieving significant efficiency gains, demonstrating the potential of external information for adaptive retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, complex tasks requiring multi-round retrieval remain challenging, and early attempts tend to be overly optimistic without a good sense of self-skepticism. Current multi-round RAG systems may continue searching even when enough information has already been retrieved, or they may provide incorrect answers without having sufficient information or knowledge. Existing solutions either require large amounts of expensive human-labeled process supervision data or lead to subpar performance. This paper aims to address these limitations by introducing a new framework, \textbf{SIM-RAG}, to explicitly enhance RAG systems' self-awareness and multi-round retrieval capabilities. To train SIM-RAG, we first let a RAG system self-practice multi-round retrieval, augmenting existing question-answer pairs with intermediate inner monologue reasoning steps to generate synthetic training data. For each pair, the system may explore multiple retrieval paths, which are labeled as successful if they reach the correct answer and unsuccessful otherwise. Using this data, we train a lightweight information sufficiency Critic. At inference time, the Critic evaluates whether the RAG system has retrieved sufficient information at each round, guiding retrieval decisions and improving system-level self-awareness through in-context reinforcement learning. Experiments across multiple prominent RAG benchmarks show that SIM-RAG is an effective multi-round RAG solution. Furthermore, this framework is system-efficient, adding a lightweight component to RAG without requiring modifications to existing LLMs or search engines, and data-efficient, eliminating the need for costly human-annotated mid-step retrieval process supervision data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 48th International ACM SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

This results in non-uniform cluster access patterns in disk-based vector search systems, particularly in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. While existing approaches optimize individual queries, they overlook the impact of cluster access patterns, failing to account for the locality effects of queries that access similar clusters. This oversight reduces cache efficiency and increases search latency due to excessive disk I/O. To address this, we introduce CaGR-RAG, a context-aware query grouping mechanism that organizes queries based on shared cluster access patterns. Additionally, it incorporates opportunistic cluster prefetching to minimize cache misses during transitions between query groups, further optimizing retrieval performance. Experimental results show that CaGR-RAG reduces 99th percentile tail latency by up to 51.55% while consistently maintaining a higher cache hit ratio than the baseline.</p></details> |  |

However, efficient deployment of these systems presents significant technical challenges due to their inherently heterogeneous computational pipelines comprising LLMs, databases, and specialized processing components. We introduce Patchwork, a comprehensive end-to-end RAG serving framework designed to address these efficiency bottlenecks. Patchwork's architecture offers three key innovations: First, it provides a flexible specification interface enabling users to implement custom RAG pipelines. Secondly, it deploys these pipelines as distributed inference systems while optimizing for the unique scalability characteristics of individual RAG components. Third, Patchwork incorporates an online scheduling mechanism that continuously monitors request load and execution progress, dynamically minimizing SLO violations through strategic request prioritization and resource auto-scaling. Our experimental evaluation across four distinct RAG implementations demonstrates that Patchwork delivers substantial performance improvements over commercial alternatives, achieving throughput gains exceeding 48% while simultaneously reducing SLO violations by ~24%.</p></details> |  |

A Survey of Methods and Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20119v2)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has advanced significantly in recent years. The complexity of RAG systems, which involve multiple components-such as indexing, retrieval, and generation-along with numerous other parameters, poses substantial challenges for systematic evaluation and quality enhancement. Previous research highlights that evaluating RAG systems is essential for documenting advancements, comparing configurations, and identifying effective approaches for domain-specific applications. This study systematically reviews 63 academic articles to provide a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art RAG evaluation methodologies, focusing on four key areas: datasets, retrievers, indexing and databases, and the generator component. We observe the feasibility of an automated evaluation approach for each component of a RAG system, leveraging an LLM capable of both generating evaluation datasets and conducting evaluations. In addition, we found that further practical research is essential to provide companies with clear guidance on the do's and don'ts of implementing and evaluating RAG systems. By synthesizing evaluation approaches for key RAG components and emphasizing the creation and adaptation of domain-specific datasets for benchmarking, we contribute to the advancement of systematic evaluation methods and the improvement of evaluation rigor for RAG systems. Furthermore, by examining the interplay between automated approaches leveraging LLMs and human judgment, we contribute to the ongoing discourse on balancing automation and human input, clarifying their respective contributions, limitations, and challenges in achieving robust and reliable evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 Pag...</summary><p>8 Pages.

A clear separation of private information from the LLM training has made RAG the basis for many enterprise LLM workloads as it allows the company to augment LLM's understanding using customers' private documents. Despite its popularity for private documents in enterprise deployments, current RAG benchmarks for validating and optimizing RAG pipelines draw their corpora from public data such as Wikipedia or generic web pages and offer little to no personal context. Seeking to empower more personal and private RAG we release the EnronQA benchmark, a dataset of 103,638 emails with 528,304 question-answer pairs across 150 different user inboxes. EnronQA enables better benchmarking of RAG pipelines over private data and allows for experimentation on the introduction of personalized retrieval settings over realistic data. Finally, we use EnronQA to explore the tradeoff in memorization and retrieval when reasoning over private documents.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Talk Before You Retrieve: Agent-Led Discussions for Better RAG in Medical QA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21252v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical question answering (QA) is a reasoning-intensive task that remains challenging for large language models (LLMs) due to hallucinations and outdated domain knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) provides a promising post-training solution by leveraging external knowledge. However, existing medical RAG systems suffer from two key limitations: (1) a lack of modeling for human-like reasoning behaviors during information retrieval, and (2) reliance on suboptimal medical corpora, which often results in the retrieval of irrelevant or noisy snippets. To overcome these challenges, we propose Discuss-RAG, a plug-and-play module designed to enhance the medical QA RAG system through collaborative agent-based reasoning. Our method introduces a summarizer agent that orchestrates a team of medical experts to emulate multi-turn brainstorming, thereby improving the relevance of retrieved content. Additionally, a decision-making agent evaluates the retrieved snippets before their final integration. Experimental results on four benchmark medical QA datasets show that Discuss-RAG consistently outperforms MedRAG, especially significantly improving answer accuracy by up to 16.67% on BioASQ and 12.20% on PubMedQA. The code is available at: https://github.com/LLM-VLM-GSL/Discuss-RAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[SLA Management in Reconfigurable Multi-Agent RAG: A Systems Approach to Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06832v2)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to generalize to new information by decoupling reasoning capabilities from static knowledge bases. Traditional RAG enhancements have explored vertical scaling-assigning subtasks to specialized modules-and horizontal scaling-replicating tasks across multiple agents-to improve performance. However, real-world applications impose diverse Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, involving trade-offs among objectives such as reducing cost, ensuring answer quality, and adhering to specific operational constraints. In this work, we present a systems-oriented approach to multi-agent RAG tailored for real-world Question Answering (QA) applications. By integrating task-specific non-functional requirements-such as answer quality, cost, and latency-into the system, we enable dynamic reconfiguration to meet diverse SLAs. Our method maps these Service Level Objectives (SLOs) to system-level parameters, allowing the generation of optimal results within specified resource constraints. We conduct a case study in the QA domain, demonstrating how dynamic re-orchestration of a multi-agent RAG system can effectively manage the trade-off between answer quality and cost. By adjusting the system based on query intent and operational conditions, we systematically balance performance and resource utilization. This approach allows the system to meet SLOs for various query types, showcasing its practicality for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-Guided Dynamic Retrieval for Improving Generation Quality in RAG Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19436v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on the dynamic optimization of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. It proposes a state-aware dynamic knowledge retrieval mechanism to enhance semantic understanding and knowledge scheduling efficiency in large language models for open-domain question answering and complex generation tasks. The method introduces a multi-level perceptive retrieval vector construction strategy and a differentiable document matching path. These components enable end-to-end joint training and collaborative optimization of the retrieval and generation modules. This effectively addresses the limitations of static RAG structures in context adaptation and knowledge access. Experiments are conducted on the Natural Questions dataset. The proposed structure is thoroughly evaluated across different large models, including GPT-4, GPT-4o, and DeepSeek. Comparative and ablation experiments from multiple perspectives confirm the significant improvements in BLEU and ROUGE-L scores. The approach also demonstrates stronger robustness and generation consistency in tasks involving semantic ambiguity and multi-document fusion. These results highlight its broad application potential and practical value in building high-quality language generation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring the Role of Knowledge Graph-Based RAG in Japanese Medical Question Answering with Small-Scale LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10982v5)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) perform well in medical QA, but their effectiveness in Japanese contexts is limited due to privacy constraints that prevent the use of commercial models like GPT-4 in clinical settings. As a result, recent efforts focus on instruction-tuning open-source LLMs, though the potential of combining them with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we are the first to explore a knowledge graph-based (KG) RAG framework for Japanese medical QA small-scale open-source LLMs. Experimental results show that KG-based RAG has only a limited impact on Japanese medical QA using small-scale open-source LLMs. Further case studies reveal that the effectiveness of the RAG is sensitive to the quality and relevance of the external retrieved content. These findings offer valuable insights into the challenges and potential of applying RAG in Japanese medical QA, while also serving as a reference for other low-resource languages.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[W-RAG: Weakly Supervised Dense Retrieval in RAG for Open-domain Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08444v2)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In knowledge-intensive tasks such as open-domain question answering (OpenQA), large language models (LLMs) often struggle to generate factual answers, relying solely on their internal (parametric) knowledge. To address this limitation, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance LLMs by retrieving relevant information from external sources, thereby positioning the retriever as a pivotal component. Although dense retrieval demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, its training poses challenges due to the scarcity of ground-truth evidence, largely attributed to the high costs of human annotation. In this paper, we propose W-RAG, a method that draws weak training signals from the downstream task (such as OpenQA) of an LLM, and fine-tunes the retriever to prioritize passages that most benefit the task. Specifically, we rerank the top-$k$ passages retrieved via BM25 by assessing the probability that the LLM will generate the correct answer for a question given each passage. The highest-ranking passages are then used as positive fine-tuning examples for dense retrieval. We conduct comprehensive experiments across four publicly available OpenQA datasets to demonstrate that our approach enhances both retrieval and OpenQA performance compared to baseline models, achieving results comparable to models fine-tuned with human-labeled data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Even Small Reasoners Should Quote Their Sources: Introducing the Pleias-RAG Model Family](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18225v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new generation of small reasoning models for RAG, search, and source summarization. Pleias-RAG-350m and Pleias-RAG-1B are mid-trained on a large synthetic dataset emulating the retrieval of a wide variety of multilingual open sources from the Common Corpus. They provide native support for citation and grounding with literal quotes and reintegrate multiple features associated with RAG workflows, such as query routing, query reformulation, and source reranking. Pleias-RAG-350m and Pleias-RAG-1B outperform SLMs below 4 billion parameters on standardized RAG benchmarks (HotPotQA, 2wiki) and are competitive with popular larger models, including Qwen-2.5-7B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Gemma-3-4B. They are the only SLMs to date maintaining consistent RAG performance across leading European languages and ensuring systematic reference grounding for statements. Due to their size and ease of deployment on constrained infrastructure and higher factuality by design, the models unlock a range of new use cases for generative AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAG LLMs are Not Safer: A Safety Analysis of Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18041v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efforts to ensure the safety of large language models (LLMs) include safety fine-tuning, evaluation, and red teaming. However, despite the widespread use of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, AI safety work focuses on standard LLMs, which means we know little about how RAG use cases change a model's safety profile. We conduct a detailed comparative analysis of RAG and non-RAG frameworks with eleven LLMs. We find that RAG can make models less safe and change their safety profile. We explore the causes of this change and find that even combinations of safe models with safe documents can cause unsafe generations. In addition, we evaluate some existing red teaming methods for RAG settings and show that they are less effective than when used for non-RAG settings. Our work highlights the need for safety research and red-teaming methods specifically tailored for RAG LLMs.</p></details> | NAACL 2025 |
