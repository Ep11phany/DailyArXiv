| **[A Scalable Measure of Loss Landscape Curvature for Analyzing the Training Dynamics of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16979v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the curvature evolution of the loss landscape is fundamental to analyzing the training dynamics of neural networks. The most commonly studied measure, Hessian sharpness ($λ_{\max}^H$) -- the largest eigenvalue of the loss Hessian -- determines local training stability and interacts with the learning rate throughout training. Despite its significance in analyzing training dynamics, direct measurement of Hessian sharpness remains prohibitive for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to high computational cost. We analyze $\textit{critical sharpness}$ ($λ_c$), a computationally efficient measure requiring fewer than $10$ forward passes given the update direction $Δ\mathbfθ$. Critically, this measure captures well-documented Hessian sharpness phenomena, including progressive sharpening and Edge of Stability. Using this measure, we provide the first demonstration of these sharpness phenomena at scale, up to $7$B parameters, spanning both pre-training and mid-training of OLMo-2 models. We further introduce $\textit{relative critical sharpness}$ ($λ_c^{1\to 2}$), which quantifies the curvature of one loss landscape while optimizing another, to analyze the transition from pre-training to fine-tuning and guide data mixing strategies. Critical sharpness provides practitioners with a practical tool for diagnosing curvature dynamics and informing data composition choices at scale. More broadly, our work shows that scalable curvature measures can provide actionable insights for large-scale training.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Towards Reasoning for PDE Foundation Models: A Reward-Model-Driven Inference-Time-Scaling Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02846v3)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are the bedrock for modern computational sciences and engineering, and inherently computationally expensive. While PDE foundation models have shown much promise for simulating such complex spatio-temporal phenomena, existing models remain constrained by the pretraining datasets and struggle with auto-regressive rollout performance, especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. Furthermore, they have significant compute and training data requirements which hamper their use in many critical applications. Inspired by recent advances in ``thinking" strategies used in large language models (LLMs), we introduce the first test-time computing (TTC) strategy for PDEs that utilizes computational resources during inference to achieve more accurate predictions with fewer training samples and smaller models. We accomplish this with two types of reward models that evaluate predictions of a stochastic based model for spatio-temporal consistency. We demonstrate this method on compressible Euler-equation simulations from the PDEGym benchmark and show that TTC captures improved predictions relative to standard non-adaptive auto-regressive inference. This TTC framework marks a foundational step towards more advanced reasoning algorithms or PDE modeling, inluding building reinforcement-learning-based approaches, potentially transforming computational workflows in physics and engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Reasoning for Cold-Start Item Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18261v3)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential for improving recommendation systems through their inherent reasoning capabilities and extensive knowledge base. Yet, existing studies predominantly address warm-start scenarios with abundant user-item interaction data, leaving the more challenging cold-start scenarios, where sparse interactions hinder traditional collaborative filtering methods, underexplored. To address this limitation, we propose novel reasoning strategies designed for cold-start item recommendations within the Netflix domain. Our method utilizes the advanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs to effectively infer user preferences, particularly for newly introduced or rarely interacted items. We systematically evaluate supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning, and hybrid approaches that combine both methods to optimize recommendation performance. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate significant improvements in both methodological efficacy and practical performance in cold-start recommendation contexts. Remarkably, our reasoning-based fine-tuned models outperform Netflix's production ranking model by up to 8% in certain cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published on Proceedings of the ACM on Web Conference 2026 (WWW 2026)</p></details> |
| **[On Fine-Grained I/O Complexity of Attention Backward Passes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09397v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional proficiency in handling extensive context windows in natural language. Nevertheless, the quadratic scaling of attention computation relative to sequence length creates substantial efficiency bottlenecks, necessitating the development of I/O-optimized algorithms. In this work, we conduct a systematic examination of the I/O complexity inherent in attention mechanisms, with a specific emphasis on the backward pass under both small and large cache settings. By leveraging the red-blue pebble game framework, we derive tight bounds for I/O complexity across the full spectrum of cache sizes. We validate that FlashAttention, one of the current industry standards, achieves optimality in the large-cache scenario for both forward and backward passes. Conversely, for small-cache environments, we introduce a novel algorithm that outperforms contemporary methods and successfully attains theoretical tight bounds. Furthermore, we expand our investigation to include sparse attention by establishing granular lower bounds for both forward and backward passes across all cache configurations. Ultimately, our results solidify the theoretical framework regarding I/O complexity in attention mechanisms, providing critical guidance for the development of efficient LLM training and inference systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empowering Medical Equipment Sustainability in Low-Resource Settings: An AI-Powered Diagnostic and Support Platform for Biomedical Technicians](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16967v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), a significant proportion of medical diagnostic equipment remains underutilized or non-functional due to a lack of timely maintenance, limited access to technical expertise, and minimal support from manufacturers, particularly for devices acquired through third-party vendors or donations. This challenge contributes to increased equipment downtime, delayed diagnoses, and compromised patient care. This research explores the development and validation of an AI-powered support platform designed to assist biomedical technicians in diagnosing and repairing medical devices in real-time. The system integrates a large language model (LLM) with a user-friendly web interface, enabling imaging technologists/radiographers and biomedical technicians to input error codes or device symptoms and receive accurate, step-by-step troubleshooting guidance. The platform also includes a global peer-to-peer discussion forum to support knowledge exchange and provide additional context for rare or undocumented issues. A proof of concept was developed using the Philips HDI 5000 ultrasound machine, achieving 100% precision in error code interpretation and 80% accuracy in suggesting corrective actions. This study demonstrates the feasibility and potential of AI-driven systems to support medical device maintenance, with the aim of reducing equipment downtime to improve healthcare delivery in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the MIRASOL Workshop at MICCAI 2025.

| **[AgentDrive: An Open Benchmark Dataset for Agentic AI Reasoning with LLM-Generated Scenarios in Autonomous Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16964v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has sparked growing interest in their integration into autonomous systems for reasoning-driven perception, planning, and decision-making. However, evaluating and training such agentic AI models remains challenging due to the lack of large-scale, structured, and safety-critical benchmarks. This paper introduces AgentDrive, an open benchmark dataset containing 300,000 LLM-generated driving scenarios designed for training, fine-tuning, and evaluating autonomous agents under diverse conditions. AgentDrive formalizes a factorized scenario space across seven orthogonal axes: scenario type, driver behavior, environment, road layout, objective, difficulty, and traffic density. An LLM-driven prompt-to-JSON pipeline generates semantically rich, simulation-ready specifications that are validated against physical and schema constraints. Each scenario undergoes simulation rollouts, surrogate safety metric computation, and rule-based outcome labeling. To complement simulation-based evaluation, we introduce AgentDrive-MCQ, a 100,000-question multiple-choice benchmark spanning five reasoning dimensions: physics, policy, hybrid, scenario, and comparative reasoning. We conduct a large-scale evaluation of fifty leading LLMs on AgentDrive-MCQ. Results show that while proprietary frontier models perform best in contextual and policy reasoning, advanced open models are rapidly closing the gap in structured and physics-grounded reasoning. We release the AgentDrive dataset, AgentDrive-MCQ benchmark, evaluation code, and related materials at https://github.com/maferrag/AgentDrive</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[DataStates-LLM: Scalable Checkpointing for Transformer Models Using Composable State Providers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16956v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of Large Transformer-based models, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), now scaling to trillions of parameters, has necessitated training across thousands of GPUs using complex hybrid parallelism strategies (e.g., data, tensor, and pipeline parallelism). Checkpointing this massive, distributed state is critical for a wide range of use cases, such as resilience, suspend-resume, investigating undesirable training trajectories, and explaining model evolution. However, existing checkpointing solutions typically treat model state as opaque binary blobs, ignoring the ``3D heterogeneity'' of the underlying data structures--varying by memory location (GPU vs. Host), number of ``logical'' objects sharded and split across multiple files, data types (tensors vs. Python objects), and their serialization requirements. This results in significant runtime overheads due to blocking device-to-host transfers, data-oblivious serialization, and storage I/O contention. In this paper, we introduce DataStates-LLM, a novel checkpointing architecture that leverages State Providers to decouple state abstraction from data movement. DataStates-LLM exploits the immutability of model parameters during the forward and backward passes to perform ``lazy'', non-blocking asynchronous snapshots. By introducing State Providers, we efficiently coalesce fragmented, heterogeneous shards and overlap the serialization of metadata with bulk tensor I/O. We evaluate DataStates-LLM on models up to 70B parameters on 256 A100-40GB GPUs. Our results demonstrate that DataStates-LLM achieves up to 4$\times$ higher checkpointing throughput and reduces end-to-end training time by up to 2.2$\times$ compared to state-of-the-art solutions, effectively mitigating the serialization and heterogeneity bottlenecks in extreme-scale LLM training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating the Effect of Retrieval Augmentation on Social Biases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17611v3)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has gained popularity as a method for conveniently incorporating novel facts that were not seen during the pre-training stage in Large Language Model (LLM)-based Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems. However, LLMs are known to encode significant levels of unfair social biases. The modulation of these biases by RAG in NLG systems is not well understood. In this paper, we systematically study the relationship between the different components of a RAG system and the social biases presented in the text generated across three languages (i.e. English, Japanese and Chinese) and four social bias types (i.e. gender, race, age and religion). Specifically, using the Bias Question Answering (BBQ) benchmark datasets, we evaluate the social biases in RAG responses from document collections with varying levels of stereotypical biases, employing multiple LLMs used as generators. We find that the biases in document collections are often amplified in the generated responses, even when the generating LLM exhibits a low-level of bias. Our findings raise concerns about the use of RAG as a technique for injecting novel facts into NLG systems and call for careful evaluation of potential social biases in RAG applications before their real-world deployment.</p></details> | EACL26 main |
| **[Strategies for Span Labeling with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16946v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for text analysis tasks, such as named entity recognition or error detection. Unlike encoder-based models, however, generative architectures lack an explicit mechanism to refer to specific parts of their input. This leads to a variety of ad-hoc prompting strategies for span labeling, often with inconsistent results. In this paper, we categorize these strategies into three families: tagging the input text, indexing numerical positions of spans, and matching span content. To address the limitations of content matching, we introduce LogitMatch, a new constrained decoding method that forces the model's output to align with valid input spans. We evaluate all methods across four diverse tasks. We find that while tagging remains a robust baseline, LogitMatch improves upon competitive matching-based methods by eliminating span matching issues and outperforms other strategies in some setups.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient semantic uncertainty quantification in language models via diversity-steered sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21310v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately estimating semantic aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in large language models (LLMs) is particularly challenging in free-form question answering (QA), where obtaining stable estimates often requires many expensive generations. We introduce a diversity-steered sampler that discourages semantically redundant outputs during decoding, covers both autoregressive and masked diffusion paradigms, and yields substantial sample-efficiency gains. The key idea is to inject a continuous semantic-similarity penalty into the model's proposal distribution using a natural language inference (NLI) model lightly finetuned on partial prefixes or intermediate diffusion states. We debias downstream uncertainty estimates with importance reweighting and shrink their variance with control variates. Across four QA benchmarks, our method matches or surpasses baselines while covering more semantic clusters with the same number of samples. Being modular and requiring no gradient access to the base LLM, the framework promises to serve as a drop-in enhancement for uncertainty estimation in risk-sensitive model deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages (+7 appendix), 7 figures.

| **[AfriEconQA: A Benchmark Dataset for African Economic Analysis based on World Bank Reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15297v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce AfriEconQA, a specialized benchmark dataset for African economic analysis grounded in a comprehensive corpus of 236 World Bank reports. The task of AfriEconQA is to answer complex economic queries that require high-precision numerical reasoning and temporal disambiguation from specialized institutional documents. The dataset consists of 8,937 curated QA instances, rigorously filtered from a pool of 10018 synthetic questions to ensure high-quality evidence-answer alignment. Each instance is composed of: (1) a question requiring reasoning over economic indicators, (2) the corresponding evidence retrieved from the corpus, (3) a verified ground-truth answer, and (4) source metadata (e.g., URL and publication date) to ensure temporal provenance. AfriEconQA is the first benchmark focused specifically on African economic analysis, providing a unique challenge for Information Retrieval (IR) systems, as the data is largely absent from the pretraining corpora of current Large Language Models (LLMs). We operationalize this dataset through an 11-experiment matrix, benchmarking a zero-shot baseline (GPT-5 Mini) against RAG configurations using GPT-4o and Qwen 32B across five distinct embedding and ranking strategies. Our results demonstrate a severe parametric knowledge gap, where zero-shot models fail to answer over 90 percent of queries, and even state-of-the-art RAG pipelines struggle to achieve high precision. This confirms AfriEconQA as a robust and challenging benchmark for the next generation of domain-specific IR and RAG systems. The AfriEconQA dataset and code will be made publicly available upon publication.</p></details> |  |
| **[CASE -- Condition-Aware Sentence Embeddings for Conditional Semantic Textual Similarity Measurement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17279v4)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The meaning conveyed by a sentence often depends on the context in which it appears. Despite the progress of sentence embedding methods, it remains unclear how to best modify a sentence embedding conditioned on its context. To address this problem, we propose Condition-Aware Sentence Embeddings (CASE), an efficient and accurate method to create an embedding for a sentence under a given condition. First, CASE creates an embedding for the condition using a Large Language Model (LLM), where the sentence influences the attention scores computed for the tokens in the condition during pooling. Next, a supervised nonlinear projection is learned to reduce the dimensionality of the LLM-based text embeddings. We show that CASE significantly outperforms previously proposed Conditional Semantic Textual Similarity (C-STS) methods on an existing standard benchmark dataset. We find that subtracting the condition embedding consistently improves the C-STS performance of LLM-based text embeddings. Moreover, we propose a supervised dimensionality reduction method that not only reduces the dimensionality of LLM-based embeddings but also significantly improves their performance.</p></details> | Accepted to EACL2026 |
| **[GRIP: Algorithm-Agnostic Machine Unlearning for Mixture-of-Experts via Geometric Router Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16905v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine unlearning (MU) for large language models has become critical for AI safety, yet existing methods fail to generalize to Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We identify that traditional unlearning methods exploit MoE's architectural vulnerability: they manipulate routers to redirect queries away from knowledgeable experts rather than erasing knowledge, causing a loss of model utility and superficial forgetting. We propose Geometric Routing Invariance Preservation (GRIP), an algorithm-agnostic framework for unlearning for MoE. Our core contribution is a geometric constraint, implemented by projecting router gradient updates into an expert-specific null-space. Crucially, this decouples routing stability from parameter rigidity: while discrete expert selections remain stable for retained knowledge, the continuous router parameters remain plastic within the null space, allowing the model to undergo necessary internal reconfiguration to satisfy unlearning objectives. This forces the unlearning optimization to erase knowledge directly from expert parameters rather than exploiting the superficial router manipulation shortcut. GRIP functions as an adapter, constraining router parameter updates without modifying the underlying unlearning algorithm. Extensive experiments on large-scale MoE models demonstrate that our adapter eliminates expert selection shift (achieving over 95% routing stability) across all tested unlearning methods while preserving their utility. By preventing existing algorithms from exploiting MoE model's router vulnerability, GRIP adapts existing unlearning research from dense architectures to MoEs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Programming over Thinking: Efficient and Robust Multi-Constraint Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09097v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-constraint planning involves identifying, evaluating, and refining candidate plans while satisfying multiple, potentially conflicting constraints. Existing large language model (LLM) approaches face fundamental limitations in this domain. Pure reasoning paradigms, which rely on long natural language chains, are prone to inconsistency, error accumulation, and prohibitive cost as constraints compound. Conversely, LLMs combined with coding- or solver-based strategies lack flexibility: they often generate problem-specific code from scratch or depend on fixed solvers, failing to capture generalizable logic across diverse problems. To address these challenges, we introduce the Scalable COde Planning Engine (SCOPE), a framework that disentangles query-specific reasoning from generic code execution. By separating reasoning from execution, SCOPE produces solver functions that are consistent, deterministic, and reusable across queries while requiring only minimal changes to input parameters. SCOPE achieves state-of-the-art performance while lowering cost and latency. For example, with GPT-4o, it reaches 93.1% success on TravelPlanner, a 61.6% gain over the best baseline (CoT) while cutting inference cost by 1.4x and time by ~4.67x.

| **[SPRINT: Scalable and Predictive Intent Refinement for LLM-Enhanced Session-based Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00570v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have enhanced conventional recommendation models via user profiling, which generates representative textual profiles from users' historical interactions. However, their direct application to session-based recommendation (SBR) remains challenging due to severe session context scarcity and poor scalability. In this paper, we propose SPRINT, a scalable SBR framework that incorporates reliable and informative intents while ensuring high efficiency in both training and inference. SPRINT constrains LLM-based profiling with a global intent pool and validates inferred intents based on recommendation performance to mitigate noise and hallucinations under limited context. To ensure scalability, LLMs are selectively invoked only for uncertain sessions during training, while a lightweight intent predictor generalizes intent prediction to all sessions without LLM dependency at inference time. Experiments on real-world datasets show that SPRINT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods while providing more explainable recommendations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning Promotes Robustness in Theory of Mind Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16853v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong performance on Theory of Mind (ToM) tests, prompting debate about the nature and true performance of the underlying capabilities. At the same time, reasoning-oriented LLMs trained via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) have achieved notable improvements across a range of benchmarks. This paper examines the behavior of such reasoning models in ToM tasks, using novel adaptations of machine psychological experiments and results from established benchmarks. We observe that reasoning models consistently exhibit increased robustness to prompt variations and task perturbations. Our analysis indicates that the observed gains are more plausibly attributed to increased robustness in finding the correct solution, rather than to fundamentally new forms of ToM reasoning. We discuss the implications of this interpretation for evaluating social-cognitive behavior in LLMs.</p></details> | 14 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Detecting High-Stakes Interactions with Activation Probes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10805v4)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monitoring is an important aspect of safely deploying Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper examines activation probes for detecting ``high-stakes'' interactions -- where the text indicates that the interaction might lead to significant harm -- as a critical, yet underexplored, target for such monitoring. We evaluate several probe architectures trained on synthetic data, and find them to exhibit robust generalization to diverse, out-of-distribution, real-world data. Probes' performance is comparable to that of prompted or finetuned medium-sized LLM monitors, while offering computational savings of six orders-of-magnitude. These savings are enabled by reusing activations of the model that is being monitored. Our experiments also highlight the potential of building resource-aware hierarchical monitoring systems, where probes serve as an efficient initial filter and flag cases for more expensive downstream analysis. We release our novel synthetic dataset and the codebase at https://github.com/arrrlex/models-under-pressure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Improving Training Efficiency and Reducing Maintenance Costs via Language Specific Model Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16127v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning a task-specific multilingual large language model (LLM) involves training the model on a multilingual dataset with examples in all the required languages. Updating one or more supported languages with additional data or adding support for a new language involves retraining the model, which can be computationally inefficient and creates a severe maintenance bottleneck. Recent research on merging multilingual multitask models has shown promise in terms of improved quality, but its computational and maintenance efficiency remains unstudied. In this work, we provide the first focused analysis of this merging strategy from an efficiency perspective, evaluating it across three independent tasks. We demonstrate significant efficiency gains while maintaining parity in terms of quality: this merging approach reduces the initial training time by up to 50\%. We also demonstrate that updating an individual language and re-merging as part of model maintenance reduces training costs by more than 60\%, compared to re-training the full multilingual model. We show this on both public and proprietary industry datasets confirming that the approach works well for industrial use cases in addition to academic settings already studied in previous work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EACL 2026 Industry Track</p></details> |
| **[Theoretical Foundations of Scaling Law in Familial Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23407v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural scaling laws have become foundational for optimizing large language model (LLM) training, yet they typically assume a single dense model output. This limitation effectively overlooks "Familial models, a transformative paradigm essential for realizing ubiquitous intelligence across heterogeneous device-edge-cloud hierarchies. Transcending static architectures, familial models integrate early exits with relay-style inference to spawn G deployable sub-models from a single shared backbone. In this work, we theoretically and empirically extend the scaling law to capture this "one-run, many-models" paradigm by introducing Granularity (G) as a fundamental scaling variable alongside model size (N) and training tokens (D). To rigorously quantify this relationship, we propose a unified functional form L(N, D, G) and parameterize it using large-scale empirical runs. Specifically, we employ a rigorous IsoFLOP experimental design to strictly isolate architectural impact from computational scale. Across fixed budgets, we systematically sweep model sizes (N) and granularities (G) while dynamically adjusting tokens (D). This approach effectively decouples the marginal cost of granularity from the benefits of scale, ensuring high-fidelity parameterization of our unified scaling law. Our results reveal that the granularity penalty follows a multiplicative power law with an extremely small exponent. Theoretically, this bridges fixed-compute training with dynamic architectures. Practically, it validates the "train once, deploy many" paradigm, demonstrating that deployment flexibility is achievable without compromising the compute-optimality of dense baselines.</p></details> |  |

Disentangling fluid and crystallized intelligence of large language models using chess](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16823v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities, yet it remains unclear to what extent these reflect sophisticated recall (crystallized intelligence) or reasoning ability (fluid intelligence). We introduce chess as a controlled testbed for disentangling these faculties. Leveraging the game's structure and scalable engine evaluations, we construct a taxonomy of positions varying in training corpus proximity--ranging from common states solvable by memorization to novel ones requiring first-principles reasoning. We systematically evaluate multiple GPT generations under varying reasoning intensities. Our analysis reveals a clear gradient: performance consistently degrades as fluid intelligence demands increase. Notably, in out-of-distribution tasks, performance collapses to random levels. While newer models improve, progress slows significantly for tasks outside the training distribution. Furthermore, while reasoning-augmented inference improves performance, its marginal benefit per token decreases with distributional proximity. These results suggest current architectures remain limited in systematic generalization, highlighting the need for mechanisms beyond scale to achieve robust fluid intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Curse of Depth in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05795v4)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce the Curse of Depth, a concept that highlights, explains, and addresses the recent observation in modern Large Language Models (LLMs) where nearly half of the layers are less effective than expected. We first confirm the wide existence of this phenomenon across the most popular families of LLMs such as Llama, Mistral, DeepSeek, and Qwen. Our analysis, theoretically and empirically, identifies that the underlying reason for the ineffectiveness of deep layers in LLMs is the widespread usage of Pre-Layer Normalization (Pre-LN). While Pre-LN stabilizes the training of Transformer LLMs, its output variance exponentially grows with the model depth, which undesirably causes the derivative of the deep Transformer blocks to be an identity matrix, and therefore barely contributes to the training. To resolve this training pitfall, we propose LayerNorm Scaling (LNS), which scales the variance of output of the layer normalization inversely by the square root of its depth. This simple modification mitigates the output variance explosion of deeper Transformer layers, improving their contribution. Across a wide range of model sizes (130M to 7B), our experiments show that LNS consistently outperforms previous normalization and scaling techniques in enhancing LLM pre-training performance. Moreover, this improvement seamlessly carries over to supervised fine-tuning. All these gains can be attributed to the fact that LayerNorm Scaling enables deeper layers to contribute more effectively during training. Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/lmsdss/LayerNorm-Scaling}{LayerNorm-Scaling}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Hybrid Phonological Filtering for Greek Poetry Rhyme Detection and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09631v4)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their remarkable capabilities across NLP tasks, struggle with phonologically-grounded phenomena like rhyme detection and generation. This is even more evident in lower-resource languages such as Modern Greek. In this paper, we present a hybrid system that combines LLMs with deterministic phonological algorithms to achieve accurate rhyme identification/analysis and generation. Our approach implements a comprehensive taxonomy of Greek rhyme types, including Pure, Rich, Imperfect, Mosaic, and Identical Pre-rhyme Vowel (IDV) patterns, and employs an agentic generation pipeline with phonological verification. We evaluate multiple prompting strategies (zero-shot, few-shot, Chain-of-Thought, and RAG-augmented) across several LLMs including Claude 3.7 and 4.5, GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 and open-weight models like Llama 3.1 8B and 70B and Mistral Large. Results reveal a significant "Reasoning Gap": while native-like models (Claude 3.7) perform intuitively (40\% accuracy in identification), reasoning-heavy models (Claude 4.5) achieve state-of-the-art performance (54\%) only when prompted with Chain-of-Thought. Most critically, pure LLM generation fails catastrophically (under 4\% valid poems), while our hybrid verification loop restores performance to 73.1\%. We release our system and a corpus of 40,000+ rhymes, derived from the Anemoskala and Interwar Poetry corpora, to support future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models as Automatic Annotators and Annotation Adjudicators for Fine-Grained Opinion Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16800v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained opinion analysis of text provides a detailed understanding of expressed sentiments, including the addressed entity. Although this level of detail is sound, it requires considerable human effort and substantial cost to annotate opinions in datasets for training models, especially across diverse domains and real-world applications. We explore the feasibility of LLMs as automatic annotators for fine-grained opinion analysis, addressing the shortage of domain-specific labelled datasets. In this work, we use a declarative annotation pipeline. This approach reduces the variability of manual prompt engineering when using LLMs to identify fine-grained opinion spans in text. We also present a novel methodology for an LLM to adjudicate multiple labels and produce final annotations. After trialling the pipeline with models of different sizes for the Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) and Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment (ACOS) analysis tasks, we show that LLMs can serve as automatic annotators and adjudicators, achieving high Inter-Annotator Agreement across individual LLM-based annotators. This reduces the cost and human effort needed to create these fine-grained opinion-annotated datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Persuasion Tokens for Editing Factual Knowledge in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16781v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-context knowledge editing (IKE) is a promising technique for updating Large Language Models (LLMs) with new information. However, IKE relies on lengthy, fact-specific demonstrations which are costly to create and consume significant context window space. In this paper, we introduce persuasion tokens (P-Tokens) -- special tokens trained to replicate the effect of IKE demonstrations, enabling efficient knowledge editing without requiring fact-specific demonstrations. We evaluate P-Tokens across two editing datasets and three LLMs, demonstrating performance comparable to, and often exceeding, IKE. We further find that editing performance is robust to distractors with small negative effects to neighboring facts, and that increasing the number of P-Tokens improves performance. Our work addresses key limitations of IKE and provides a more practical and scalable alternative for editing LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EACL Main 2026</p></details> |
| **[LLM-powered Real-time Patent Citation Recommendation for Financial Technologies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16775v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid financial innovation has been accompanied by a sharp increase in patenting activity, making timely and comprehensive prior-art discovery more difficult. This problem is especially evident in financial technologies, where innovations develop quickly, patent collections grow continuously, and citation recommendation systems must be updated as new applications arrive. Existing patent retrieval and citation recommendation methods typically rely on static indexes or periodic retraining, which limits their ability to operate effectively in such dynamic settings. In this study, we propose a real-time patent citation recommendation framework designed for large and fast-changing financial patent corpora. Using a dataset of 428,843 financial patents granted by the China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA) between 2000 and 2024, we build a three-stage recommendation pipeline. The pipeline uses large language model (LLM) embeddings to represent the semantic content of patent abstracts, applies efficient approximate nearest-neighbor search to construct a manageable candidate set, and ranks candidates by semantic similarity to produce top-k citation recommendations. In addition to improving recommendation accuracy, the proposed framework directly addresses the dynamic nature of patent systems. By using an incremental indexing strategy based on hierarchical navigable small-world (HNSW) graphs, newly issued patents can be added without rebuilding the entire index. A rolling day-by-day update experiment shows that incremental updating improves recall while substantially reducing computational cost compared with rebuild-based indexing. The proposed method also consistently outperforms traditional text-based baselines and alternative nearest-neighbor retrieval approaches.</p></details> |  |

While the de facto standard to deal with the problem is to treat unjudged documents as non-relevant, many alternatives have been proposed, such as the use of large language models (LLMs) as a relevance judge (LLM-as-a-judge). However, this has been criticized, among other things, as circular, since the same LLM can be used as the ranker and the judge. We propose to train topic-specific relevance classifiers instead: By finetuning monoT5 with independent LoRA weight adaptation on the judgments of a single assessor for a single topic's pool, we align it to that assessor's notion of relevance for the topic. The system rankings obtained through our classifier's relevance judgments achieve a Spearmans' $ρ$ correlation of $>0.94$ with ground truth system rankings. As little as 128 initial human judgments per topic suffice to improve the comparability of models, compared to treating unjudged documents as non-relevant, while achieving more reliability than existing LLM-as-a-judge approaches. Topic-specific relevance classifiers are thus a lightweight and straightforward way to tackle the unjudged document problem, while maintaining human judgments as the gold standard for retrieval evaluation. Code, models, and data are made openly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Standardizing Longitudinal Radiology Report Evaluation via Large Language Model Annotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16753v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Longitudinal information in radiology reports refers to the sequential tracking of findings across multiple examinations over time, which is crucial for monitoring disease progression and guiding clinical decisions. Many recent automated radiology report generation methods are designed to capture longitudinal information; however, validating their performance is challenging. There is no proper tool to consistently label temporal changes in both ground-truth and model-generated texts for meaningful comparisons. Existing annotation methods are typically labor-intensive, relying on the use of manual lexicons and rules. Complex rules are closed-source, domain specific and hard to adapt, whereas overly simple ones tend to miss essential specialised information. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising annotation alternative, as they are capable of capturing nuanced linguistic patterns and semantic similarities without extensive manual intervention. They also adapt well to new contexts. In this study, we therefore propose an LLM-based pipeline to automatically annotate longitudinal information in radiology reports. The pipeline first identifies sentences containing relevant information and then extracts the progression of diseases. We evaluate and compare five mainstream LLMs on these two tasks using 500 manually annotated reports. Considering both efficiency and performance, Qwen2.5-32B was subsequently selected and used to annotate another 95,169 reports from the public MIMIC-CXR dataset. Our Qwen2.5-32B-annotated dataset provided us with a standardized benchmark for evaluating report generation models. Using this new benchmark, we assessed seven state-of-the-art report generation models. Our LLM-based annotation method outperforms existing annotation solutions, achieving 11.3\% and 5.3\% higher F1-scores for longitudinal information detection and disease tracking, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Who Does This Name Remind You of ? Nationality Prediction via Large Language Model Associative Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12771v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) possess extensive world knowledge, yet methods for effectively eliciting this knowledge remain underexplored. Nationality and region prediction tasks require understanding of not only linguistic features but also cultural and historical background, making LLM world knowledge particularly valuable. However, conventional LLM prompting methods rely on direct reasoning approaches, which have limitations in applying abstract linguistic rules. We propose LLM Associative Memory Agents (LAMA), a novel framework that leverages LLM world knowledge as associative memory. Rather than directly inferring nationality from names, LAMA recalls famous individuals with the same name and aggregates their nationalities through indirect reasoning. A dual-agent architecture comprising a Person Agent and a Media Agent, specialized in different knowledge domains, recalls famous individuals in parallel, generating Top-1 predictions through voting and Top-K predictions through conditional completion. On a 99-country nationality prediction task, LAMA achieved 0.817 accuracy, substantially outperforming conventional LLM prompting methods and neural models. Our experiments reveal that LLMs exhibit higher reliability in recalling concrete examples than in abstract reasoning, that recall-based approaches are robust to low-frequency nationalities independent of data frequency distributions, and that the dual-agent architecture functions complementarily to produce synergistic effects. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of a new multi-agent system that retrieves and aggregates LLM knowledge rather than prompting reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[LATTLE: LLM Attention Transplant for Transfer Learning of Tabular Data Across Disparate Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06161v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transfer learning on tabular data is challenging due to disparate feature spaces across domains, in contrast to the homogeneous structures of image and text. Large language models (LLMs) offer a knowledge base to improve the limited effectiveness of cross-domain transfer learning for tabular data. However, LLM performance often stagnates due to subjective text prompts and the computational limitations of in-context learning. We present a novel language-to-tabular context-learning method that uses attention-specific transformer weights, enabling seamless transfer learning across disparate tabular data sets. The LLM attention transplant mechanism facilitates a domain-agnostic transfer learning, eliminating the need for shared features between tables, LLM prompt engineering, and large-scale pretrained models. Our experiments using ten pairs of disjoint source-target data sets and 12 baseline methods demonstrate the superiority of the proposed LLM-attention transplant for transfer learning (LATTLE) method over traditional ML models, state-of-the-art deep tabular architectures, and models trained on thousands to billions of tabular samples. The proposed cross-domain attention transfer demonstrates an effective solution for adapting LLMs to learning non-text tabular data in a low-resource environment. The source code of the LATTLE implementation is publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Supporting Stakeholder Requirements Expression with LLM Revisions: An Empirical Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16699v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stakeholders often struggle to accurately express their requirements due to articulation barriers arising from limited domain knowledge or from cognitive constraints. This can cause misalignment between expressed and intended requirements, complicating elicitation and validation. Traditional elicitation techniques, such as interviews and follow-up sessions, are time-consuming and risk distorting stakeholders' original intent across iterations. Large Language Models (LLMs) can infer user intentions from context, suggesting potential for assisting stakeholders in expressing their needs. This raises the questions of (i) how effectively LLMs can support requirement expression and (ii) whether such support benefits stakeholders with limited domain expertise. We conducted a study with 26 participants who produced 130 requirement statements. Each participant first expressed requirements unaided, then evaluated LLM-generated revisions tailored to their context. Participants rated LLM revisions significantly higher than their original statements across all dimensions-alignment with intent, readability, reasoning, and unambiguity. Qualitative feedback further showed that LLM revisions often surfaced tacit details stakeholders considered important and helped them better understand their own requirements. We present and evaluate a stakeholder-centered approach that leverages LLMs as articulation aids in requirements elicitation and validation. Our results show that LLM-assisted reformulation improves perceived completeness, clarity, and alignment of requirements. By keeping stakeholders in the validation loop, this approach promotes responsible and trustworthy use of AI in Requirements Engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at the research track of the 32nd International Working Conference on Requirements Engineering: Foundation for Software Quality (REFSQ 2026)</p></details> |

Jailbreak detection methods show promise in mitigating jailbreak attacks through the assistance of other models or multiple model inferences. However, existing methods entail significant computational costs. In this paper, we first present a finding that the difference in output distributions between jailbreak and benign prompts can be employed for detecting jailbreak prompts. Based on this finding, we propose a Free Jailbreak Detection (FJD) which prepends an affirmative instruction to the input and scales the logits by temperature to further distinguish between jailbreak and benign prompts through the confidence of the first token. Furthermore, we enhance the detection performance of FJD through the integration of virtual instruction learning. Extensive experiments on aligned LLMs show that our FJD can effectively detect jailbreak prompts with almost no additional computational costs during LLM inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 (Findings) https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-emnlp.309/</p></details> |

Given the scarcity of existing resources for Estonian, a new dataset was created by combining manually translated corpora with GPT-4.0-generated simplifications. OpenNMT was selected as a representative NMT-based system, while LLaMA was fine-tuned on the constructed dataset. Evaluation shows LLaMA outperforms OpenNMT in grammaticality, readability, and meaning preservation. These results underscore the effectiveness of large language models for text simplification in low-resource language settings. The complete dataset, fine-tuning scripts, and evaluation pipeline are provided in a publicly accessible supplementary package to support reproducibility and adaptation to other languages.</p></details> | <details><summary>RANLP...</summary><p>RANLP 2025 version, including code and data</p></details> |

Existing evaluation methods often fail to capture the structured diagnostic logic that underlies radiological interpretation, resulting in unreliable judgments and limited clinical relevance. We introduce AgentsEval, a multi-agent stream reasoning framework that emulates the collaborative diagnostic workflow of radiologists. By dividing the evaluation process into interpretable steps including criteria definition, evidence extraction, alignment, and consistency scoring, AgentsEval provides explicit reasoning traces and structured clinical feedback. We also construct a multi-domain perturbation-based benchmark covering five medical report datasets with diverse imaging modalities and controlled semantic variations. Experimental results demonstrate that AgentsEval delivers clinically aligned, semantically faithful, and interpretable evaluations that remain robust under paraphrastic, semantic, and stylistic perturbations. This framework represents a step toward transparent and clinically grounded assessment of medical report generation systems, fostering trustworthy integration of large language models into clinical practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Transactions to Exploits: Automated PoC Synthesis for Real-World DeFi Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16681v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blockchain systems are increasingly targeted by on-chain attacks that exploit contract vulnerabilities to extract value rapidly and stealthily, making systematic analysis and reproduction highly challenging. In practice, reproducing such attacks requires manually crafting proofs-of-concept (PoCs), a labor-intensive process that demands substantial expertise and scales poorly. In this work, we present the first automated framework for synthesizing verifiable PoCs directly from on-chain attack executions. Our key insight is that attacker logic can be recovered from low-level transaction traces via trace-driven reverse engineering, and then translated into executable exploits by leveraging the code-generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs). To this end, we propose TracExp, which localizes attack-relevant execution contexts from noisy, multi-contract traces and introduces a novel dual-decompiler to transform concrete executions into semantically enriched exploit pseudocode. Guided by this representation, TracExp synthesizes PoCs and refines them to preserve exploitability-relevant semantics. We evaluate TracExp on 321 real-world attacks over the past 20 months. TracExp successfully synthesizes PoCs for 93% of incidents, with 58.78% being directly verifiable, at an average cost of only \$0.07 per case. Moreover, TracExp enabled the release of a large number of previously unavailable PoCs to the community, earning a $900 bounty and demonstrating strong practical impact.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |
| **[PLawBench: A Rubric-Based Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs in Real-World Legal Practice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16669v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to legal domain-specific tasks, evaluating their ability to perform legal work in real-world settings has become essential. However, existing legal benchmarks rely on simplified and highly standardized tasks, failing to capture the ambiguity, complexity, and reasoning demands of real legal practice. Moreover, prior evaluations often adopt coarse, single-dimensional metrics and do not explicitly assess fine-grained legal reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce PLawBench, a Practical Law Benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic legal practice scenarios. Grounded in real-world legal workflows, PLawBench models the core processes of legal practitioners through three task categories: public legal consultation, practical case analysis, and legal document generation. These tasks assess a model's ability to identify legal issues and key facts, perform structured legal reasoning, and generate legally coherent documents. PLawBench comprises 850 questions across 13 practical legal scenarios, with each question accompanied by expert-designed evaluation rubrics, resulting in approximately 12,500 rubric items for fine-grained assessment. Using an LLM-based evaluator aligned with human expert judgments, we evaluate 10 state-of-the-art LLMs. Experimental results show that none achieves strong performance on PLawBench, revealing substantial limitations in the fine-grained legal reasoning capabilities of current LLMs and highlighting important directions for future evaluation and development of legal LLMs. Data is available at: https://github.com/skylenage/PLawbench.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting the Role of Natural Language Code Comments in Code Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16661v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of large language models (LLMs) has ushered in a new era in automated code translation across programming languages. Since most code-specific LLMs are pretrained on well-commented code from large repositories like GitHub, it is reasonable to hypothesize that natural language code comments could aid in improving translation quality. Despite their potential relevance, comments are largely absent from existing code translation benchmarks, rendering their impact on translation quality inadequately characterised. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study evaluating the impact of comments on translation performance. Our analysis involves more than $80,000$ translations, with and without comments, of $1100+$ code samples from two distinct benchmarks covering pairwise translations between five different programming languages: C, C++, Go, Java, and Python. Our results provide strong evidence that code comments, particularly those that describe the overall purpose of the code rather than line-by-line functionality, significantly enhance translation accuracy. Based on these findings, we propose COMMENTRA, a code translation approach, and demonstrate that it can potentially double the performance of LLM-based code translation. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first in terms of its comprehensiveness, scale, and language coverage on how to improve code translation accuracy using code comments.</p></details> |  |

Evaluating Lower-dimensional Vectors for LLM Training Data Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16651v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gradient-based methods for instance-based explanation for large language models (LLMs) are hindered by the immense dimensionality of model gradients. In practice, influence estimation is restricted to a subset of model parameters to make computation tractable, but this subset is often chosen ad hoc and rarely justified by systematic evaluation. This paper investigates if it is better to create low-dimensional representations by selecting a small, architecturally informed subset of model components or by projecting the full gradients into a lower-dimensional space. Using a novel benchmark, we show that a greedily selected subset of components captures the information about training data influence needed for a retrieval task more effectively than either the full gradient or random projection. We further find that this approach is more computationally efficient than random projection, demonstrating that targeted component selection is a practical strategy for making instance-based explanations of large models more computationally feasible.</p></details> | 8 pages |

In this work, we aim to better understand the relative importance of advancing these underlying capabilities for success on such tasks. We develop an oracle counterfactual framework for multi-turn problems that asks: how would an agent perform if it could leverage an oracle to perfectly perform a specific task? The change in the agent's performance due to this oracle assistance allows us to measure the criticality of such oracle skill in the future advancement of AI agents. We introduce a suite of procedurally generated, game-like tasks with tunable complexity. These controlled environments allow us to provide precise oracle interventions, such as perfect planning or flawless state tracking, and make it possible to isolate the contribution of each oracle without confounding effects present in real-world benchmarks. Our results show that while some interventions (e.g., planning) consistently improve performance across settings, the usefulness of other skills is dependent on the properties of the environment and language model. Our work sheds light on the challenges of multi-turn agentic environments to guide the future efforts in the development of AI agents and language models.</p></details> |  |

We examine how an incentive to convey humanness and task characteristics shape this human vs AI race across five studies. In Study 1-2 (n=530 and n=610) humans and a large language model (LLM) wrote relationship advice or relationship descriptions, either with or without instructions to sound human. New participants (n=428 and n=408) judged each text's source. Instructions to sound human were only effective for the LLM, reducing the human advantage. Study 3 (n=360 and n=350) showed that these effects persist when writers were instructed to avoid sounding like an LLM. Study 4 (n=219) tested empathy as mechanism of humanness and concluded that LLMs can produce empathy without humanness and humanness without empathy. Finally, computational text analysis (Study 5) indicated that LLMs become more human-like by applying an implicit representation of humanness to mimic stochastic empathy.</p></details> | preprint (updated) |

However, existing LLM-based agents often struggle with low-diversity and suboptimal code generation. While recent work has introduced Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to address these issues, limitations persist in the quality and diversity of thoughts generated, as well as in the scalar value feedback mechanisms used for node selection. In this study, we introduce Introspective Monte Carlo Tree Search (I-MCTS), a novel approach that iteratively expands tree nodes through an introspective process that meticulously analyzes solutions and results from parent and sibling nodes. This facilitates a continuous refinement of the node in the search tree, thereby enhancing the overall decision-making process. Furthermore, we integrate a Large Language Model (LLM)-based value model to facilitate direct evaluation of each node's solution prior to conducting comprehensive computational rollouts. A hybrid rewarding mechanism is implemented to seamlessly transition the Q-value from LLM-estimated scores to actual performance scores. This allows higher-quality nodes to be traversed earlier. Applied to the various ML tasks, our approach demonstrates a 4% absolute improvement in performance compared to the strong open-source AutoML agents, showcasing its effectiveness in enhancing agentic AutoML systems.

Since language use is more informal, spontaneous, and adheres to many different sociolects, the performance of NLP models often deteriorates. One solution to this problem is to transform data to a standard variant before processing it, which is also called lexical normalization. There has been a wide variety of benchmarks and models proposed for this task. The MultiLexNorm benchmark proposed to unify these efforts, but it consists almost solely of languages from the Indo-European language family in the Latin script. Hence, we propose an extension to MultiLexNorm, which covers 5 Asian languages from different language families in 4 different scripts. We show that the previous state-of-the-art model performs worse on the new languages and propose a new architecture based on Large Language Models (LLMs), which shows more robust performance. Finally, we analyze remaining errors, revealing future directions for this task.</p></details> |  |

Benchmarking Rational Preference Utilization in Personalized Assistants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16621v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM)-powered assistants have recently integrated memory mechanisms that record user preferences, leading to more personalized and user-aligned responses. However, irrelevant personalized memories are often introduced into the context, interfering with the LLM's intent understanding. To comprehensively investigate the dual effects of personalization, we develop RPEval, a benchmark comprising a personalized intent reasoning dataset and a multi-granularity evaluation protocol. RPEval reveals the widespread phenomenon of irrational personalization in existing LLMs and, through error pattern analysis, illustrates its negative impact on user experience. Finally, we introduce RP-Reasoner, which treats memory utilization as a pragmatic reasoning process, enabling the selective integration of personalized information. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms carefully designed baselines on RPEval, and resolves 80% of the bad cases observed in a large-scale commercial personalized assistant, highlighting the potential of pragmatic reasoning to mitigate irrational personalization. Our benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/XueyangFeng/RPEval.</p></details> |  |

Recent works mostly finetuned the pre-trained visual language models to achieve performance gain, yet suffering from overfitting and weak generalization. To deal with this, we introduce UniFGVC, a universal training-free framework that reformulates few-shot FGVC as multimodal retrieval. First, we propose the Category-Discriminative Visual Captioner (CDV-Captioner) to exploit the open-world knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate a structured text description that captures the fine-grained attribute features distinguishing closely related classes. CDV-Captioner uses chain-of-thought prompting and visually similar reference images to reduce hallucination and enhance discrimination of generated captions. Using it we can convert each image into an image-description pair, enabling more comprehensive feature representation, and construct the multimodal category templates using few-shot samples for the subsequent retrieval pipeline. Then, off-the-shelf vision and text encoders embed query and template pairs, and FGVC is accomplished by retrieving the nearest template in the joint space. UniFGVC ensures broad compatibility with diverse MLLMs and encoders, offering reliable generalization and adaptability across few-shot FGVC scenarios. Extensive experiments on 12 FGVC benchmarks demonstrate its consistent superiority over prior few-shot CLIP-based methods and even several fully-supervised MLLMs-based approaches.</p></details> |  |

First, we fine-tune the LLMs with the CVSS corpus, employing designed tri-task learning and chain of modality methods to boost the initial performance. Then, leveraging the fine-tuned model, we generate preference pairs through self-sampling and back-translation without human evaluation. Finally, these preference pairs are used for preference optimization to enhance the model's S2ST capability further.

Many deep learning models (DLMs) deployed in the production environment are gradually being replaced by VLLMs. Compared with DLMs, VLLMs have some advantages in industrial applications: (1) Their strong generalization ability enables them to perform well across a wide range of tasks. (2) They are flexible and can deal with unfamiliar samples through context learning quickly. However, VLLMs also have obvious drawbacks: (1) VLLMs do not perform as well as custom-developed DLMs in specific domains. (2) The number of parameters in VLLMs is generally quite large, and their deployment requires substantial computational resources. (3) VLLMs generally operate much slower than DLMs, making real-time response challenging to achieve. To better utilize VLLMs in industrial applications, we introduce AuroraEdge-V-2B in this work, a compact, robust, and high-speed VLLM designed for edge deployment. To make the model run faster, we also propose a compression-fusion method to improve inference efficiency. AuroraEdge-V-2B has the following notable features: (1) Easy deployment and faster: It has only 2B parameters and is highly suitable for edge deployment, offering better real-time performance. (2) Fewer visual tokens and cheaper: It significantly reduces the number of visual tokens in the decoding process, thereby reducing the floating-point operations by half during inference and making it cheaper to use. (3) Strong performance: It gets a higher score on 9 benchmarks than models with the same number of parameter (e.g., Qwen2-VL-2B, Qwen2.5-VL-3B, InternVL-2.5-2B).</p></details> |  |

While recent MoA variants have introduced dynamic routing and residual connections to improve efficiency, these methods often fail to facilitate deep semantic interaction between agents, limiting the system's ability to actively correct hallucinations and refine logic. In this paper, we introduce Attention-MoA, a novel MoA-based framework that redefines collaboration through Inter-agent Semantic Attention. Complemented by an Inter-layer Residual Module with Adaptive Early Stopping Mechanism, our architecture mitigates information degradation in deep layers while improving computational efficiency. Extensive evaluations across AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench, and FLASK demonstrate that Attention-MoA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 91.15% Length-Controlled Win Rate on AlpacaEval 2.0 and dominating in 10 out of 12 capabilities on FLASK. Notably, Attention-MoA enables an ensemble of small open-source models to outperform massive proprietary models like Claude-4.5-Sonnet and GPT-4.1, achieving an MT-Bench score of 8.83 and an AlpacaEval 2.0 LC Win Rate of 77.36%.</p></details> |  |

However, does such efficiency gains translate into effective agentic behavior? In this work, we present a comprehensive evaluation of dLLMs (e.g., LLaDA, Dream) across two distinct agentic paradigms: Embodied Agents (requiring long-horizon planning) and Tool-Calling Agents (requiring precise formatting). Contrary to the efficiency hype, our results on Agentboard and BFCL reveal a "bitter lesson": current dLLMs fail to serve as reliable agentic backbones, frequently leading to systematically failure. (1) In Embodied settings, dLLMs suffer repeated attempts, failing to branch under temporal feedback. (2) In Tool-Calling settings, dLLMs fail to maintain symbolic precision (e.g. strict JSON schemas) under diffusion noise. To assess the potential of dLLMs in agentic workflows, we introduce DiffuAgent, a multi-agent evaluation framework that integrates dLLMs as plug-and-play cognitive cores. Our analysis shows that dLLMs are effective in non-causal roles (e.g., memory summarization and tool selection) but require the incorporation of causal, precise, and logically grounded reasoning mechanisms into the denoising process to be viable for agentic tasks.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Predicting Startup Success Using Large Language Models: A Novel In-Context Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16568v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Venture capital (VC) investments in early-stage startups that end up being successful can yield high returns. However, predicting early-stage startup success remains challenging due to data scarcity (e.g., many VC firms have information about only a few dozen of early-stage startups and whether they were successful). This limits the effectiveness of traditional machine learning methods that rely on large labeled datasets for model training. To address this challenge, we propose an in-context learning framework for startup success prediction using large language models (LLMs) that requires no model training and leverages only a small set of labeled startups as demonstration examples. Specifically, we propose a novel k-nearest-neighbor-based in-context learning framework, called kNN-ICL, which selects the most relevant past startups as examples based on similarity. Using real-world profiles from Crunchbase, we find that the kNN-ICL approach achieves higher prediction accuracy than supervised machine learning baselines and vanilla in-context learning. Further, we study how performance varies with the number of in-context examples and find that a high balanced accuracy can be achieved with as few as 50 examples. Together, we demonstrate that in-context learning can serve as a decision-making tool for VC firms operating in data-scarce environments.</p></details> |  |

This paper addresses the gap by focusing on the application of LLMs to the United Nations (UN) decision-making process, where the stakes are particularly high and political decisions can have far-reaching consequences. We introduce a novel dataset comprising publicly available UN Security Council (UNSC) records from 1994 to 2024, including draft resolutions, voting records, and diplomatic speeches. Using this dataset, we propose the United Nations Benchmark (UNBench), the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs across four interconnected political science tasks: co-penholder judgment, representative voting simulation, draft adoption prediction, and representative statement generation. These tasks span the three stages of the UN decision-making process--drafting, voting, and discussing--and aim to assess LLMs' ability to understand and simulate political dynamics. Our experimental analysis demonstrates the potential and challenges of applying LLMs in this domain, providing insights into their strengths and limitations in political science. This work contributes to the growing intersection of AI and political science, opening new avenues for research and practical applications in global governance.

| **[From LLMs to Agents in Programming: The Impact of Providing an LLM with a Compiler](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12146v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models have demonstrated a remarkable capability in natural language and program generation and software development. However, the source code generated by the LLMs does not always meet quality requirements and may fail to compile. Therefore, many studies evolve into agents that can reason about the problem before generating the source code for the solution. The goal of this paper is to study the degree to which such agents benefit from access to software development tools, in our case, a gcc compiler. We conduct a computational experiment on the RosettaCode dataset, on 699 programming tasks in C. We evaluate how the integration with a compiler shifts the role of the language model from a passive generator to an active agent capable of iteratively developing runnable programs based on feedback from the compiler. We evaluated 16 language models with sizes ranging from small (135 million) to medium (3 billion) and large (70 billion). Our results show that access to a compiler improved the compilation success by 5.3 to 79.4 percentage units in compilation without affecting the semantics of the generated program. Syntax errors dropped by 75%, and errors related to undefined references dropped by 87% for the tasks where the agents outperformed the baselines. We also observed that in some cases, smaller models with a compiler outperform larger models with a compiler. We conclude that it is essential for LLMs to have access to software engineering tools to enhance their performance and reduce the need for large models in software engineering, such as reducing our energy footprint.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods typically follow a decomposition paradigm, in which a claim is broken down into sub-claims that are individually verified. However, the decomposition paradigm may introduce noise to the verification process due to irrelevant entities or evidence, ultimately degrading verification accuracy. To address this problem, we propose a Retrieve-Refine-Calibrate (RRC) framework based on large language models (LLMs). Specifically, the framework first identifies the entities mentioned in the claim and retrieves evidence relevant to them. Then, it refines the retrieved evidence based on the claim to reduce irrelevant information. Finally, it calibrates the verification process by re-evaluating low-confidence predictions. Experiments on two popular fact-checking datasets (HOVER and FEVEROUS-S) demonstrate that our framework achieves superior performance compared with competitive baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Cognitive Control Architecture (CCA): A Lifecycle Supervision Framework for Robustly Aligned AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06716v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents exhibit significant vulnerability to Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) attacks. These attacks hijack agent behavior by polluting external information sources, exploiting fundamental trade-offs between security and functionality in existing defense mechanisms. This leads to malicious and unauthorized tool invocations, diverting agents from their original objectives. The success of complex IPIs reveals a deeper systemic fragility: while current defenses demonstrate some effectiveness, most defense architectures are inherently fragmented. Consequently, they fail to provide full integrity assurance across the entire task execution pipeline, forcing unacceptable multi-dimensional compromises among security, functionality, and efficiency. Our method is predicated on a core insight: no matter how subtle an IPI attack, its pursuit of a malicious objective will ultimately manifest as a detectable deviation in the action trajectory, distinct from the expected legitimate plan. Based on this, we propose the Cognitive Control Architecture (CCA), a holistic framework achieving full-lifecycle cognitive supervision. CCA constructs an efficient, dual-layered defense system through two synergistic pillars: (i) proactive and preemptive control-flow and data-flow integrity enforcement via a pre-generated "Intent Graph"; and (ii) an innovative "Tiered Adjudicator" that, upon deviation detection, initiates deep reasoning based on multi-dimensional scoring, specifically designed to counter complex conditional attacks. Experiments on the AgentDojo benchmark substantiate that CCA not only effectively withstands sophisticated attacks that challenge other advanced defense methods but also achieves uncompromised security with notable efficiency and robustness, thereby reconciling the aforementioned multi-dimensional trade-off.</p></details> |  |

This work offers a rigorous, unified benchmark by using four publicly available datasets covering text and image modalities (binary and multiclass complexity) that contrasts traditional Machine Learning (ML) with contemporary transformer-based techniques. We evaluated three model classes for each task: Classical ML (LR, LightGBM, ResNet-50), Prompt-Based LLMs/VLMs (Gemini 2.5), and Fine-Tuned PEFT Models (LoRA-adapted Gemma3 variants). All experiments used consistent data splits and aligned metrics. According to our results, traditional machine learning (ML) models set a high standard by consistently achieving the best overall performance across most medical categorization tasks. This was especially true for structured text-based datasets, where the classical models performed exceptionally well. In stark contrast, the LoRA-tuned Gemma variants consistently showed the worst performance across all text and image experiments, failing to generalize from the minimal fine-tuning provided. However, the zero-shot LLM/VLM pipelines (Gemini 2.5) had mixed results; they performed poorly on text-based tasks, but demonstrated competitive performance on the multiclass image task, matching the classical ResNet-50 baseline. These results demonstrate that in many medical categorization scenarios, established machine learning models continue to be the most reliable option. The experiment suggests that foundation models are not universally superior and that the effectiveness of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is highly dependent on the adaptation strategy, as minimal fine-tuning proved detrimental in this study.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables, paper accepted in AAIML'26 conference</p></details> |
| **[CORD: Bridging the Audio-Text Reasoning Gap via Weighted On-policy Cross-modal Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16547v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) have garnered significant research interest. Despite being built upon text-based large language models (LLMs), LALMs frequently exhibit a degradation in knowledge and reasoning capabilities. We hypothesize that this limitation stems from the failure of current training paradigms to effectively bridge the acoustic-semantic gap within the feature representation space. To address this challenge, we propose CORD, a unified alignment framework that performs online cross-modal self-distillation. Specifically, it aligns audio-conditioned reasoning with its text-conditioned counterpart within a unified model. Leveraging the text modality as an internal teacher, CORD performs multi-granularity alignment throughout the audio rollout process. At the token level, it employs on-policy reverse KL divergence with importance-aware weighting to prioritize early and semantically critical tokens. At the sequence level, CORD introduces a judge-based global reward to optimize complete reasoning trajectories via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Empirical results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that CORD consistently enhances audio-conditioned reasoning and substantially bridges the audio-text performance gap with only 80k synthetic training samples, validating the efficacy and data efficiency of our on-policy, multi-level cross-modal alignment approach.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |

Existing parameter regularization methods (e.g., O-LoRA, N-LoRA) mitigate interference via low-rank subspace orthogonality, but additive updates distort the intrinsic geometry of model parameters. We propose \textbf{OLieRA}, a Lie group based fine-tuning framework that preserves parameter geometry through multiplicative updates while enforcing orthogonality across task subspaces. OLieRA achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Standard CL benchmark and remains highly competitive under large task sequences. It further inherits the replay-free and task-ID free inference properties of O-LoRA, establishing a principled paradigm for continual learning in LLMs.</p></details> | 13 pages, 3 figures |

Probing the Representational Alignment of Audio LLMs and Naturalistic EEG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16540v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio Large Language Models (Audio LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in integrating speech perception with language understanding. However, whether their internal representations align with human neural dynamics during naturalistic listening remains largely unexplored. In this work, we systematically examine layer-wise representational alignment between 12 open-source Audio LLMs and Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals across 2 datasets. Specifically, we employ 8 similarity metrics, such as Spearman-based Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA), to characterize within-sentence representational geometry. Our analysis reveals 3 key findings: (1) we observe a rank-dependence split, in which model rankings vary substantially across different similarity metrics; (2) we identify spatio-temporal alignment patterns characterized by depth-dependent alignment peaks and a pronounced increase in RSA within the 250-500 ms time window, consistent with N400-related neural dynamics; (3) we find an affective dissociation whereby negative prosody, identified using a proposed Tri-modal Neighborhood Consistency (TNC) criterion, reduces geometric similarity while enhancing covariance-based dependence. These findings provide new neurobiological insights into the representational mechanisms of Audio LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods overlook the importance of the ability to continuously work in an ever-changing world, and lack the possibility of deployment on embodied systems in real-world environments. In this work, we introduce OnlineSI, a framework that can continuously improve its spatial understanding of its surroundings given a video stream. Our core idea is to maintain a finite spatial memory to retain past observations, ensuring the computation required for each inference does not increase as the input accumulates. We further integrate 3D point cloud information with semantic information, helping MLLM to better locate and identify objects in the scene. To evaluate our method, we introduce the Fuzzy $F_1$-Score to mitigate ambiguity, and test our method on two representative datasets. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, paving the way towards real-world embodied systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://onlinesi.github.io/</p></details> |

However, its efficient deployment on Huawei's Ascend 910 Neural Processing Unit (NPU) is challenging due to limited native mixed-precision support and the accelerator's decoupled compute architecture. To enable quantization on such architecture, we present the first practical W4A16 matrix multiplication kernel tailored for the Ascend 910 NPU. Our design leverages vector cores for on-the-fly INT4-to-FP16 dequantization, cube cores for high-throughput GEMM, and Split-K parallelization to mitigate memory latency. Performance evaluations across diverse matrix shapes and batch sizes show our method outperforms data-parallel approaches when K >> N, a typical scenario in LLM decoding. Specially, our method can achieve a speedup ranging from 1.01x to 1.74x. In addition, our profile reveals the primary bottleneck is not dequantization compution itself, but extra global memory transfer for the weight, making W4A16 only reaching a maximum speedup of 1.48x over native FP16xFP16 matrix multiplication in PyTorch. In the long run, our method lays a solid foundation and provides insightful views for the efficient deployment of quantized large language models on various domain-specific accelerators.</p></details> |  |

Despite the effectiveness in general-domain benchmarks, their applicability to complex medical domain remains largely unexplored. Medical knowledge editing is particularly challenging, as it requires LLMs to internalize the knowledge and generalize to unseen scenarios for effective and interpretable decision-making. In this work, we propose a novel framework called MedEditBench to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of existing KE methods in the medical domain. In MedEditBench, we introduce a new medical knowledge editing benchmark as well as three different knowledge editing paradigms, which are designed to assess the impact of different knowledge sources for editing. Our findings indicate that current KE methods result in only superficial memorization of the injected information, failing to generalize to new scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we present Self-Generated Rationale Editing (SGR-Edit), which utilizes model-derived rationales as the target knowledge for editing, thereby uncovering the underlying reasoning process and demonstrating significant improvements over existing KE approaches. Additionally, we offer deeper insights into medical knowledge editing, including the localization of medical knowledge in LLMs and the impact of sequential editing on evolving knowledge. This could provide practical guidance for implementing KE methods in real-world medical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EACL 2026 Main Conference</p></details> |

We propose training lightweight text classifiers using dynamically generated supervision from an LLM. Our method employs an iterative, agentic loop in which the LLM curates training data, analyzes model successes and failures, and synthesizes targeted examples to address observed errors. This closed-loop generation and evaluation process progressively improves data quality and adapts it to the downstream classifier and task. Across four widely used benchmarks, our approach consistently outperforms standard zero and few-shot baselines. These results indicate that LLMs can serve effectively as data curators, enabling accurate and efficient classification without the operational cost of large-model deployment.</p></details> |  |

We introduce SycoEval-EM, a multi-agent simulation framework evaluating LLM robustness through adversarial patient persuasion in emergency medicine. Across 20 LLMs and 1,875 encounters spanning three Choosing Wisely scenarios, acquiescence rates ranged from 0-100\%. Models showed higher vulnerability to imaging requests (38.8\%) than opioid prescriptions (25.0\%), with model capability poorly predicting robustness. All persuasion tactics proved equally effective (30.0-36.0\%), indicating general susceptibility rather than tactic-specific weakness. Our findings demonstrate that static benchmarks inadequately predict safety under social pressure, necessitating multi-turn adversarial testing for clinical AI certification.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

While effective in domains such as mathematics, their applicability to tasks involving semi-structured data, like table question answering (TQA), remains unexplored. TQA poses unique challenges for PRMs, including abundant irrelevant information, loosely connected reasoning steps, and domain-specific reasoning. This work presents the first systematic study of PRMs for TQA. We evaluate state-of-the-art generative PRMs on TQA from both answer and step perspectives. Results show that PRMs that combine textual and code verification can aid solution selection but struggle to generalize to out-of-domain data. Analysis reveals a weak correlation between performance in step-level verification and answer accuracy, possibly stemming from weak step dependencies and loose causal links. Our findings highlight limitations of current PRMs on TQA and offer valuable insights for building more robust, process-aware verifiers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EACL 2026 Main</p></details> |

We present MusiCRS, the first benchmark for audio-centric conversational recommendation that links authentic user conversations from Reddit with corresponding tracks. MusiCRS includes 477 high-quality conversations spanning diverse genres (classical, hip-hop, electronic, metal, pop, indie, jazz), with 3,589 unique musical entities and audio grounding via YouTube links. MusiCRS supports evaluation under three input modality configurations: audio-only, query-only, and audio+query, allowing systematic comparison of audio-LLMs, retrieval models, and traditional approaches. Our experiments reveal that current systems struggle with cross-modal integration, with optimal performance frequently occurring in single-modality settings rather than multimodal configurations. This highlights fundamental limitations in cross-modal knowledge integration, as models excel at dialogue semantics but struggle when grounding abstract musical concepts in audio. To facilitate progress, we release the MusiCRS dataset (https://huggingface.co/datasets/rohan2810/MusiCRS), evaluation code (https://github.com/rohan2810/musiCRS), and comprehensive baselines.</p></details> | 5 pages |

Inspired by these achievements, there has been a growing interest in adapting LLMs for Recommendation Systems (RecSys) by reformulating RecSys tasks into generative problems. However, these End-to-End Generative Recommendation (E2E-GR) methods tend to prioritize idealized goals, often at the expense of the practical advantages offered by traditional Deep Learning based Recommendation Models (DLRMs) in terms of in features, architecture, and practices. This disparity between idealized goals and practical needs introduces several challenges and limitations, locking the scaling law in industrial RecSys. In this paper, we introduce a large user model (LUM) that addresses these limitations through a three-step paradigm, designed to meet the stringent requirements of industrial settings while unlocking the potential for scalable recommendations. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that LUM outperforms both state-of-the-art DLRMs and E2E-GR approaches. Notably, LUM exhibits excellent scalability, with performance improvements observed as the model scales up to 7 billion parameters. Additionally, we have successfully deployed LUM in an industrial application, where it achieved significant gains in an A/B test, further validating its effectiveness and practicality.</p></details> | <details><summary>WSDM ...</summary><p>WSDM 2026, 10 pages; The first three authors contributed equally to this work</p></details> |

Nevertheless, their ability to perform precise compositional spatial reasoning remains largely unexplored. Existing benchmarks often involve relatively simple tasks and rely on semantic approximations or coarse relative positioning, while their evaluation metrics are typically limited and lack rigorous mathematical formulations. To bridge this gap, we introduce TangramPuzzle, a geometry-grounded benchmark designed to evaluate compositional spatial reasoning through the lens of the classic Tangram game. We propose the Tangram Construction Expression (TCE), a symbolic geometric framework that grounds tangram assemblies in exact, machine-verifiable coordinate specifications, to mitigate the ambiguity of visual approximation. We design two complementary tasks: Outline Prediction, which demands inferring global shapes from local components, and End-to-End Code Generation, which requires solving inverse geometric assembly problems. We conduct extensive evaluation experiments on advanced open-source and proprietary models, revealing an interesting insight: MLLMs tend to prioritize matching the target silhouette while neglecting geometric constraints, leading to distortions or deformations of the pieces.</p></details> |  |

With the rise of large language models (LLMs), textual attributes in FGL graphs are gaining attention. Text-attributed graph federated learning (TAG-FGL) improves FGL by explicitly leveraging LLMs to process and integrate these textual features. However, current TAG-FGL methods face three main challenges: \textbf{(1) Overhead.} LLMs for processing long texts incur high token and computation costs. To make TAG-FGL practical, we introduce graph condensation (GC) to reduce computation load, but this choice also brings new issues. \textbf{(2) Suboptimal.} To reduce LLM overhead, we introduce GC into TAG-FGL by compressing multi-hop texts/neighborhoods into a condensed core with fixed LLM surrogates. However, this one-shot condensation is often not client-adaptive, leading to suboptimal performance. \textbf{(3) Interpretability.} LLM-based condensation further introduces a black-box bottleneck: summaries lack faithful attribution and clear grounding to specific source spans, making local inspection and auditing difficult. To address the above issues, we propose \textbf{DANCE}, a new TAG-FGL paradigm with GC. To improve \textbf{suboptimal} performance, DANCE performs round-wise, model-in-the-loop condensation refresh using the latest global model. To enhance \textbf{interpretability}, DANCE preserves provenance by storing locally inspectable evidence packs that trace predictions to selected neighbors and source text spans. Across 8 TAG datasets, DANCE improves accuracy by \textbf{2.33\%} at an \textbf{8\%} condensation ratio, with \textbf{33.42\%} fewer tokens than baselines.</p></details> |  |

While recent advancements in applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to time series modeling (TSM) have shown great promise, their effectiveness on the irregular ICU data, characterized by particularly high rates of missing values, remains largely unexplored. This work investigates two key components underlying the success of LLMs for TSM: the time series encoder and the multimodal alignment strategy. To this end, we establish a systematic testbed to evaluate their impact across various state-of-the-art LLM-based methods on benchmark ICU datasets against strong supervised and self-supervised baselines. Results reveal that the encoder design is more critical than the alignment strategy. Encoders that explicitly model irregularity achieve substantial performance gains, yielding an average AUPRC increase of $12.8\%$ over the vanilla Transformer. While less impactful, the alignment strategy is also noteworthy, with the best-performing semantically rich, fusion-based strategy achieving a modest $2.9\%$ improvement over cross-attention. However, LLM-based methods require at least 10$\times$ longer training than the best-performing irregular supervised models, while delivering only comparable performance. They also underperform in data-scarce few-shot learning settings. These findings highlight both the promise and current limitations of LLMs for irregular ICU time series.

However, this process can sometimes result in the loss or distortion of the original intended meaning. Due to the human-like quality of LLM-generated text, traditional detection methods often fail, particularly when text is paraphrased to closely mimic original content. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel approach named SearchLLM, designed to identify LLM-paraphrased text by leveraging search engine capabilities to locate potential original text sources. By analyzing similarities between the input and regenerated versions of candidate sources, SearchLLM effectively distinguishes LLM-paraphrased content. SearchLLM is designed as a proxy layer, allowing seamless integration with existing detectors to enhance their performance. Experimental results across various LLMs demonstrate that SearchLLM consistently enhances the accuracy of recent detectors in detecting LLM-paraphrased text that closely mimics original content. Furthermore, SearchLLM also helps the detectors prevent paraphrasing attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>EACL ...</summary><p>EACL 2026 camera ready (Main Track)</p></details> |

Beyond serving as code auto-completion tools in integrated development environments, large language models increasingly function as foundation models within coding agents in vibe-coding scenarios. In such settings, prompts play a central role in agent-based intelligent software development, as they not only guide the behavior of large language models but also serve as carriers of user requirements. Under the dominant conversational paradigm, prompts are typically divided into system prompts and user prompts. System prompts provide high-level instructions to steer model behavior and establish conversational context, while user prompts represent inputs and requirements provided by human users. Despite their importance, designing effective prompts remains challenging, as it requires expertise in both prompt engineering and software engineering, particularly requirements engineering. To reduce the burden of manual prompt construction, numerous automated prompt engineering methods have been proposed. However, most existing approaches neglect the methodological principles of requirements engineering, limiting their ability to generate artifacts that conform to formal requirement specifications in realistic software development scenarios. To address this gap, we propose REprompt, a multi-agent prompt optimization framework guided by requirements engineering. Experiment results demonstrate that REprompt effectively optimizes both system and user prompts by grounding prompt generation in requirements engineering principles.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we propose SafeThinker, an adaptive framework that dynamically allocates defensive resources via a lightweight gateway classifier. Based on the gateway's risk assessment, inputs are routed through three distinct mechanisms: (i) a Standardized Refusal Mechanism for explicit threats to maximize efficiency; (ii) a Safety-Aware Twin Expert (SATE) module to intercept deceptive attacks masquerading as benign queries; and (iii) a Distribution-Guided Think (DDGT) component that adaptively intervenes during uncertain generation. Experiments show that SafeThinker significantly lowers attack success rates across diverse jailbreak strategies without compromising utility, demonstrating that coordinating intrinsic judgment throughout the generation process effectively balances robustness and practicality.</p></details> |  |

Domain-specific datasets of harmful prompts remain scarce and still largely rely on manual construction; public datasets mainly focus on explicit harmful prompts, which modern LLM defenses can often detect and refuse. In contrast, implicit harmful prompts-expressed through indirect domain knowledge-are harder to detect and better reflect real-world threats. We identify two challenges: transforming domain knowledge into actionable constraints and increasing the implicitness of generated harmful prompts. To address them, we propose an end-to-end framework that first performs knowledge-graph-guided harmful prompt generation to systematically produce domain-relevant prompts, and then applies dual-path obfuscation rewriting to convert explicit harmful prompts into implicit variants via direct and context-enhanced rewriting. This framework yields high-quality datasets combining strong domain relevance with implicitness, enabling more realistic red-teaming and advancing LLM safety research. We release our code and datasets at GitHub.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Open-World Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Knowledge Graph: A Multi-Agent Collaboration Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01238v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in web search and reasoning. However, their dependence on static training corpora makes them prone to factual errors and knowledge gaps. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by incorporating external knowledge sources, especially structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which provide explicit semantics and efficient retrieval. Existing KG-based RAG approaches, however, generally assume that anchor entities are accessible to initiate graph traversal, which limits their robustness in open-world settings where accurate linking between the user query and the KG entity is unreliable. To overcome this limitation, we propose AnchorRAG, a novel multi-agent collaboration framework for open-world RAG without the predefined anchor entities. Specifically, a predictor agent dynamically identifies candidate anchor entities by aligning user query terms with KG nodes and initializes independent retriever agents to conduct parallel multi-hop explorations from each candidate. Then a supervisor agent formulates the iterative retrieval strategy for these retriever agents and synthesizes the resulting knowledge paths to generate the final answer. This multi-agent collaboration framework improves retrieval robustness and mitigates the impact of ambiguous or erroneous anchors. Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks demonstrate that AnchorRAG significantly outperforms existing baselines and establishes new state-of-the-art results on the real-world reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are We Using the Right Benchmark: An Evaluation Framework for Visual Token Compression Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07143v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent efforts to accelerate inference in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have largely focused on visual token compression. The effectiveness of these methods is commonly evaluated by measuring the accuracy drop on existing MLLM benchmarks before and after compression. However, these benchmarks are originally designed to assess general perception and reasoning abilities, rather than the specific challenges posed by visual token compression, leading to a fundamental task mismatch. In this work, we uncover a counterintuitive yet consistent phenomenon: simple image downsampling outperforms many advanced visual token compression methods across multiple widely used benchmarks. Through a comprehensive empirical study spanning eight popular benchmarks and multiple state-of-the-art compression techniques, we show that (i) current benchmarks contain substantial noise (task-irrelevant samples) for evaluating visual token compression, and (ii) downsampling can act as an effective data filter that distinguishes between simple and difficult samples with respect to compression sensitivity. Motivated by these findings, we propose VTC-Bench, an evaluation framework that explicitly leverages downsampling as a discriminator to denoise existing benchmarks, enabling a fairer and more meaningful additional assessment of visual token compression methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/Chenfei-Liao/VTC-Bench; Project Page: https://chenfei-liao.github.io/VTC-Bench-Page/</p></details> |

Due to the complex and tedious construction process, large-scale configuration is relatively inefficient. However, most methods always overlook fine-grained analysis of the actions performed by the agent, making it difficult to handle complex errors and resulting in configuration failures. To address this bottleneck, we propose EvoConfig, an efficient environment configuration framework that optimizes multi-agent collaboration to build correct runtime environments. EvoConfig features an expert diagnosis module for fine-grained post-execution analysis, and a self-evolving mechanism that lets expert agents self-feedback and dynamically adjust error-fixing priorities in real time. Empirically, EvoConfig matches the previous state-of-the-art Repo2Run on Repo2Run's 420 repositories, while delivering clear gains on harder cases: on the more challenging Envbench, EvoConfig achieves a 78.1% success rate, outperforming Repo2Run by 7.1%. Beyond end-to-end success, EvoConfig also demonstrates stronger debugging competence, achieving higher accuracy in error identification and producing more effective repair recommendations than existing methods.</p></details> |  |

However, in agentic scenarios with frequent tool calls, the traditional generation-length-based definition breaks down: tool latency decouples inference time from generation length. We propose Timely Machine, redefining test-time as wall-clock time, where models dynamically adjust strategies based on time budgets. We introduce Timely-Eval, a benchmark spanning high-frequency tool calls, low-frequency tool calls, and time-constrained reasoning. By varying tool latency, we find smaller models excel with fast feedback through more interactions, while larger models dominate high-latency settings via superior interaction quality. Moreover, existing models fail to adapt reasoning to time budgets. We propose Timely-RL to address this gap. After cold-start supervised fine-tuning, we use reinforcement learning to enhance temporal planning. Timely-RL improves time budget awareness and consistently boosts performance across Timely-Eval. We hope our work offers a new perspective on test-time scaling for the agentic era.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[TL-GRPO: Turn-Level RL for Reasoning-Guided Iterative Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16480v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities in complex tasks through tool integration, which is typically framed as a Markov Decision Process and optimized with trajectory-level RL algorithms such as GRPO. However, a common class of reasoning tasks, iterative optimization, presents distinct challenges: the agent interacts with the same underlying environment state across turns, and the value of a trajectory is determined by the best turn-level reward rather than cumulative returns. Existing GRPO-based methods cannot perform fine-grained, turn-level optimization in such settings, while black-box optimization methods discard prior knowledge and reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we propose Turn-Level GRPO (TL-GRPO), a lightweight RL algorithm that performs turn-level group sampling for fine-grained optimization. We evaluate TL-GRPO on analog circuit sizing (ACS), a challenging scientific optimization task requiring multiple simulations and domain expertise. Results show that TL-GRPO outperforms standard GRPO and Bayesian optimization methods across various specifications. Furthermore, our 30B model trained with TL-GRPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on ACS tasks under same simulation budget, demonstrating both strong generalization and practical utility.</p></details> | Work in progress |

Although classical decision theories, such as the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), offer systematic rational frameworks, their construction relies heavily on labor-intensive domain expertise, creating an "expert bottleneck" that hinders scalability in general scenarios. To bridge the gap between the generalization capabilities of LLMs and the rigor of decision theory, we propose Doc2AHP, a novel structured inference framework guided by AHP principles. Eliminating the need for extensive annotated data or manual intervention, our approach leverages the structural principles of AHP as constraints to direct the LLM in a constrained search within the unstructured document space, thereby enforcing the logical entailment between parent and child nodes. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-agent weighting mechanism coupled with an adaptive consistency optimization strategy to ensure the numerical consistency of weight allocation. Empirical results demonstrate that Doc2AHP not only empowers non-expert users to construct high-quality decision models from scratch but also significantly outperforms direct generative baselines in both logical completeness and downstream task accuracy.</p></details> |  |

We revisit this setting in a controlled study and introduce Stable-DiffCoder, a block diffusion code model that reuses the Seed-Coder architecture, data, and training pipeline. To enable efficient knowledge learning and stable training, we incorporate a block diffusion continual pretraining (CPT) stage enhanced by a tailored warmup and block-wise clipped noise schedule. Under the same data and architecture, Stable-DiffCoder overall outperforms its AR counterpart on a broad suite of code benchmarks. Moreover, relying only on the CPT and supervised fine-tuning stages, Stable-DiffCoder achieves stronger performance than a wide range of \~8B ARs and DLLMs, demonstrating that diffusion-based training can improve code modeling quality beyond AR training alone. Moreover, diffusion-based any-order modeling improves structured code modeling for editing and reasoning, and through data augmentation, benefits low-resource coding languages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Order from Chaos: Physical World Understanding from Glitchy Gameplay Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16471v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the physical world, including object dynamics, material properties, and causal interactions, remains a core challenge in artificial intelligence. Although recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive general reasoning capabilities, they still fall short of achieving human-level understanding of physical principles. Existing datasets for physical reasoning either rely on real-world videos, which incur high annotation costs, or on synthetic simulations, which suffer from limited realism and diversity. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm that leverages glitches in gameplay videos, referring to visual anomalies that violate predefined physical laws, as a rich and scalable supervision source for physical world understanding. We introduce PhysGame, an meta information guided instruction-tuning dataset containing 140,057 glitch-centric question-answer pairs across five physical domains and sixteen fine-grained categories. To ensure data accuracy, we design a prompting strategy that utilizes gameplay metadata such as titles and descriptions to guide high-quality QA generation. Complementing PhysGame, we construct GameBench, an expert-annotated benchmark with 880 glitch-identified gameplay videos designed to evaluate physical reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments show that PhysGame significantly enhances both Game2Real transferability, improving the real world physical reasoning performance of Qwen2.5VL by 2.5% on PhysBench, and Game2General transferability, yielding a 1.9% gain on the MVBench benchmark. Moreover, PhysGame-tuned models achieve a 3.7% absolute improvement on GameBench, demonstrating enhanced robustness in detecting physical implausibilities. These results indicate that learning from gameplay anomalies offers a scalable and effective pathway toward advancing physical world understanding in multimodal intelligence.</p></details> | Accepted by TMLR |

Yet, existing studies focus on narrative or role-playing tasks and overlook how adversarial conversational history alone can reshape induced personas. Black-box persona manipulation remains unexplored, raising concerns for robustness in realistic interactions. In response, we introduce the task of persona editing, which adversarially steers LLM traits through user-side inputs under a black-box, inference-only setting. To this end, we propose PHISH (Persona Hijacking via Implicit Steering in History), the first framework to expose a new vulnerability in LLM safety that embeds semantically loaded cues into user queries to gradually induce reverse personas. We also define a metric to quantify attack success. Across 3 benchmarks and 8 LLMs, PHISH predictably shifts personas, triggers collateral changes in correlated traits, and exhibits stronger effects in multi-turn settings. In high-risk domains mental health, tutoring, and customer support, PHISH reliably manipulates personas, validated by both human and LLM-as-Judge evaluations. Importantly, PHISH causes only a small reduction in reasoning benchmark performance, leaving overall utility largely intact while still enabling significant persona manipulation. While current guardrails offer partial protection, they remain brittle under sustained attack. Our findings expose new vulnerabilities in personas and highlight the need for context-resilient persona in LLMs. Our codebase and dataset is available at: https://github.com/Jivnesh/PHISH</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EACL26 (Findings)</p></details> |

This problem arises because current tools rely on simple syntactic rules rather than semantic understanding, failing to distinguish between identical API calls serving legitimate versus malicious purposes. To address this challenge, we propose PyGuard, a knowledge-driven framework that converts detection failures into useful behavioral knowledge by extracting patterns from existing tools' false positives and negatives. Our method utilizes hierarchical pattern mining to identify behavioral sequences that distinguish malicious from benign code, employs Large Language Models to create semantic abstractions beyond syntactic variations, and combines this knowledge into a detection system that integrates exact pattern matching with contextual reasoning. PyGuard achieves 99.50% accuracy with only 2 false positives versus 1,927-2,117 in existing tools, maintains 98.28% accuracy on obfuscated code, and identified 219 previously unknown malicious packages in real-world deployment. The behavioral patterns show cross-ecosystem applicability with 98.07% accuracy on NPM packages, demonstrating that semantic understanding enables knowledge transfer across programming languages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph-Anchored Knowledge Indexing for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16462v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a dominant paradigm for mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge. Nevertheless, effectively integrating and interpreting key evidence scattered across noisy documents remains a critical challenge for existing RAG systems. In this paper, we propose GraphAnchor, a novel Graph-Anchored Knowledge Indexing approach that reconceptualizes graph structures from static knowledge representations into active, evolving knowledge indices. GraphAnchor incrementally updates a graph during iterative retrieval to anchor salient entities and relations, yielding a structured index that guides the LLM in evaluating knowledge sufficiency and formulating subsequent subqueries. The final answer is generated by jointly leveraging all retrieved documents and the final evolved graph. Experiments on four multi-hop question answering benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphAnchor, and reveal that GraphAnchor modulates the LLM's attention to more effectively associate key information distributed in retrieved documents.

While watermarking has proven effective in benign settings, its robustness under adversarial evasion remains contested. To advance a rigorous understanding and evaluation of such vulnerabilities, we propose the \emph{Bias-Inversion Rewriting Attack} (BIRA), which is theoretically motivated and model-agnostic. BIRA weakens the watermark signal by suppressing the logits of likely watermarked tokens during LLM-based rewriting, without any knowledge of the underlying watermarking scheme. Across recent watermarking methods, BIRA achieves over 99\% evasion while preserving the semantic content of the original text. Beyond demonstrating an attack, our results reveal a systematic vulnerability, emphasizing the need for stress testing and robust defenses.</p></details> |  |

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have excelled in general vision-language tasks, their capabilities in emotional reasoning remain limited. The field currently suffers from a scarcity of large-scale datasets with high-quality, descriptive emotion annotations and lacks standardized benchmarks for evaluation. Our preliminary framework, Emotion-LLaMA, pioneered instruction-tuned multimodal learning for emotion reasoning but was restricted by explicit face detectors, implicit fusion strategies, and low-quality training data with limited scale. To address these limitations, we present Emotion-LLaMAv2 and the MMEVerse benchmark, establishing an end-to-end pipeline together with a standardized evaluation setting for emotion recognition and reasoning. Emotion-LLaMAv2 introduces three key advances. First, an end-to-end multiview encoder eliminates external face detection and captures nuanced emotional cues via richer spatial and temporal multiview tokens. Second, a Conv Attention pre-fusion module is designed to enable simultaneous local and global multimodal feature interactions external to the LLM backbone. Third, a perception-to-cognition curriculum instruction tuning scheme within the LLaMA2 backbone unifies emotion recognition and free-form emotion reasoning. To support large-scale training and reproducible evaluation, MMEVerse aggregates twelve publicly available emotion datasets, including IEMOCAP, MELD, DFEW, and MAFW, into a unified multimodal instruction format. The data are re-annotated via a multi-agent pipeline involving Qwen2 Audio, Qwen2.5 VL, and GPT 4o, producing 130k training clips and 36k testing clips across 18 evaluation benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, these impressive reasoning abilities face significant challenges in specialized domains. Taking Go as an example, although AlphaGo has established the high performance ceiling of AI systems in Go, mainstream LLMs still struggle to reach even beginner-level proficiency, let alone perform natural language reasoning. This performance gap between general-purpose LLMs and domain experts is significantly limiting the application of LLMs on a wider range of domain-specific tasks. In this work, we aim to bridge the divide between LLMs' general reasoning capabilities and expert knowledge in domain-specific tasks. We perform mixed fine-tuning with structured Go expertise and general long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning data as a cold start, followed by reinforcement learning to integrate expert knowledge in Go with general reasoning capabilities. Through this methodology, we present \textbf{LoGos}, a powerful LLM that not only maintains outstanding general reasoning abilities, but also conducts Go gameplay in natural language, demonstrating effective strategic reasoning and accurate next-move prediction. LoGos achieves performance comparable to human professional players, substantially surpassing all existing LLMs. Through this work, we aim to contribute insights on applying general LLM reasoning capabilities to specialized domains. We will release the first large-scale Go dataset for LLM training, the first LLM Go evaluation benchmark, and the first general LLM that reaches human professional-level performance in Go at: https://github.com/Entarochuan/LoGos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

While bilingual data in pretraining corpora is widely believed to enable these abilities, details of its contributions remain unclear. We investigate this question by pretraining models from scratch under controlled conditions, comparing the standard web corpus with a monolingual-only version that removes all multilingual documents. Despite constituting only 2% of the corpus, removing bilingual data causes translation performance to drop 56% in BLEU, while behaviour on cross-lingual QA and general reasoning tasks remains stable, with training curves largely overlapping the baseline. To understand this asymmetry, we categorize bilingual data into parallel (14%), code-switching (72%), and miscellaneous documents (14%) based on the semantic relevance of content in different languages. We then conduct granular ablations by reintroducing parallel or code-switching data into the monolingual-only corpus. Our experiments reveal that parallel data almost fully restores translation performance (91% of the unfiltered baseline), whereas code-switching contributes minimally. Other cross-lingual tasks remain largely unaffected by either type. These findings reveal that translation critically depends on systematic token-level alignments from parallel data, whereas cross-lingual understanding and reasoning appear to be achievable even without bilingual data.</p></details> | under review |

However, existing reviews have not comprehensively addressed these recent breakthroughs and their integrated impact across the creative production pipeline. This paper addresses this gap by providing a systematic review of AI technologies that have emerged or matured since our 2022 review, examining their applications across content creation, information analysis, post-production enhancement, compression, and quality assessment. We document how transformers, LLMs, diffusion models, and implicit neural representations have established new capabilities in text-to-image/video generation, real-time 3D reconstruction, and unified multi-task frameworks-shifting AI from support tool to core creative technology. Beyond technological advances, we analyze the trend toward unified AI frameworks that integrate multiple creative tasks, replacing task-specific solutions. We critically examine the evolving role of human-AI collaboration, where human oversight remains essential for creative direction and mitigating AI hallucinations. Finally, we identify emerging challenges including copyright concerns, bias mitigation, computational demands, and the need for robust regulatory frameworks. This review provides researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive understanding of current AI capabilities, limitations, and future trajectories in creative applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an updated review of our previous paper (see https://doi.org/10.1007/s10462-021-10039-7), and has been accepted by Artificial Intelligence Review journal</p></details> |

However, evaluator LLMs exhibit numerical bias, a phenomenon where certain evaluation scores are generated disproportionately often, leading reduced evaluation performance. This study investigates the cause of this bias. Given that most evaluator LLMs are aligned through instruction tuning and preference tuning, and that prior research suggests alignment reduces output diversity, we hypothesize that numerical bias arises from alignment. To test this, we compare outputs from pre- and post-alignment LLMs, and observe that alignment indeed increases numerical bias. We also explore mitigation strategies for post-alignment LLMs, including temperature scaling, distribution calibration, and score range adjustment. Among these, score range adjustment is most effective in reducing bias and improving performance, though still heuristic. Our findings highlight the need for further work on optimal score range selection and more robust mitigation strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AIBSD 2026 (Workshop at AAAI 2026)</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we propose an evolutionary automatic benchmark generation framework that leverages a large language model (LLM) as a generative operator, termed the LLM-driven evolutionary benchmark generator (LLM-EBG). In this framework, the LLM serves as an evolutionary operator that generates and evolves benchmark problems within a flexible, expressive representation space. As a case study, we generate unconstrained single-objective continuous minimization problems represented as mathematical expressions designed to induce significant performance differences between a genetic algorithm (GA) and differential evolution (DE). Experimental results show that LLM-EBG successfully produces benchmark problems in which the designated target algorithm consistently outperforms the comparative algorithm in more than 80\% of trials. Furthermore, exploratory landscape analysis reveals that benchmarks favoring GA are highly sensitive to variable scaling, demonstrating that the proposed framework can generate problems with distinct geometric characteristics that reflect the intrinsic search behaviors of different optimization algorithms.</p></details> |  |

SQL is highly optimized for processing structured data laid out in relations. Meanwhile, in the present application development landscape, it is highly desirable to utilize the power of learned models to perform complex tasks. Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to understand and extract information from unstructured textual data. However, SQL as a query language and accompanying relational database systems are either incompatible or inefficient for workloads that require leveraging learned models. This results in complex engineering and multiple data migration operations that move data between the data sources and the model inference platform. In this paper, we present iPDB, a relational system that supports in-database machine learning (ML) and large language model (LLM) inferencing using extended SQL syntax. In iPDB, LLMs and ML calls can function as semantic projects, as predicates to perform semantic selects and semantic joins, or for semantic grouping in group-by clauses. iPDB has a novel relational predict operator and semantic query optimizations that enable users to write and efficiently execute semantic SQL queries, outperforming the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

The goal is to identify the important nodes and edges of an input graph that are crucial for performing a specific graph reasoning task. A number of studies have been conducted in this area, and various benchmark datasets have been proposed to facilitate evaluation. Among them, one of the most challenging is the Spurious-Motif benchmark, introduced at ICLR 2022. The datasets in this synthetic benchmark are deliberately designed to include spurious correlations, making it particularly difficult for models to distinguish truly relevant structures from misleading patterns. As a result, existing methods exhibit significantly worse performance on this benchmark compared to others. In this paper, we focus on improving interpretability on the challenging Spurious-Motif datasets. We demonstrate that the self-reflection technique, commonly used in large language models to tackle complex tasks, can also be effectively adapted to enhance interpretability in datasets with strong spurious correlations. Specifically, we propose a self-reflection framework that can be integrated with existing interpretable graph learning methods. When such a method produces importance scores for each node and edge, our framework feeds these predictions back into the original method to perform a second round of evaluation. This iterative process mirrors how large language models employ self-reflective prompting to reassess their previous outputs. We further analyze the reasons behind this improvement from the perspective of graph representation learning, which motivates us to propose a fine-tuning training method based on this feedback mechanism.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce EmbedAgent, a paradigm designed to simulate real-world roles in embedded system development, such as Embedded System Programmer, Architect, and Integrator. This paradigm enables LLMs to be tested in tasks that bridge the gap between digital and physical systems, allowing for a more comprehensive assessment of their capabilities. To evaluate LLMs on these tasks, we propose Embedbench, the first comprehensive benchmark for embedded system programming, circuit design, and cross-platform migration. Embedbench consists of 126 cases, covering 9 electronic components across 3 hardware platforms. Through extensive experiments on 10 mainstream LLMs, we uncover several key findings. Surprisingly, despite the simplicity of the cases, DeepSeek-R1 achieves only a 55.6% pass@1 rate when provided with schematic information, and 50.0% when tasked with generating the schematics itself. In the cross-platform migration tasks, LLMs show relatively strong performance with MicroPython on the Raspberry Pi Pico (with the top model achieving 73.8% pass@1), but perform poorly on ESP-IDF, where the best model reaches only 29.4% pass@1. Interestingly, we observe that general-purpose chat LLMs like DeepSeek-V3 often fail to utilize relevant pre-trained knowledge in this domain, while reasoning LLMs tend to overthink and overlook efficient knowledge during pretraining. Based on these insights, we propose two strategies: retrieval augmented generation and compiler feedback-to enhance LLM performance. These strategies result in significant improvements, with Deepseek-R1 reaching a 65.1% pass@1 with correct schematics, and 53.1% without. Additionally, the accuracy of the Arduino to ESP32 migration task improves from 21.4% to 27.8%.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, accepted by International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)</p></details> |

However, their effectiveness in specialized domains, such as remote sensing and medical imaging, remains limited. A natural approach to domain adaptation is to inject domain knowledge through textual instructions, prompts, or auxiliary captions. Surprisingly, we find that such input-level domain knowledge injection yields little to no improvement on scientific multimodal tasks, even when the domain knowledge is explicitly provided. This observation suggests that current MLLMs fail to internalize domain-specific priors through language alone, and that domain knowledge must be integrated at the optimization level. Motivated by this insight, we propose a reinforcement fine-tuning framework that incorporates domain knowledge directly into the learning objective. Instead of treating domain knowledge as descriptive information, we encode it as domain-informed constraints and reward signals, shaping the model's behavior in the output space. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets in remote sensing and medical domains consistently demonstrate good performance gains, achieving state-of-the-art results on multimodal domain tasks. Our results highlight the necessity of optimization-level domain knowledge integration and reveal a fundamental limitation of textual domain conditioning in current MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

The domains of Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, and Robotics have also undergone a similar phenomenon through the advent of large foundational models in the form of Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision Language Models (VLMs) and Vision Language Action models (VLAs), respectively. In this paper, we investigate the current state of Artificial Intelligence for Database Systems research (AI4DB), and assess how far AI4DB systems are from achieving their own Move\,37 moment. We envision a Generative Database Agent (Gen-DBA, for short) as the pathway to achieving Move\,37 for database systems that will bring generative reasoning and creativity into the realm of database learning tasks. This vision paper explores this direction by presenting the recipe for building Gen-DBA that encompasses but is not limited to a Transformer backbone, a hardware-grounded tokenization mechanism, a two-stage Goal-Directed Next Token Prediction training paradigm, and a generative inference process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchy-Aware Multimodal Unlearning for Medical AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09867v3)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretrained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly used in sensitive domains such as medical AI, where privacy regulations like HIPAA and GDPR require specific removal of individuals' or institutions' data. This motivates machine unlearning, which aims to remove the influence of target data from a trained model. However, existing unlearning benchmarks fail to reflect the hierarchical and multimodal structure of real-world medical data, limiting their ability to properly evaluate unlearning in practice. Therefore, we introduce MedForget, a hierarchy-aware multimodal unlearning benchmark that models hospital data as a nested structure, enabling fine-grained evaluation of multimodal unlearning across retain and forget splits. Experiments with current unlearning methods show that existing approaches struggle to achieve effective hierarchy-aware forgetting without degrading downstream medical utility. To address this limitation, we propose Cross-modal Hierarchy-Informed Projection for unlearning (CHIP), a training-free, hierarchy-aware multimodal unlearning method that deletes information by selectively removing target-specific weight subspaces while preserving sibling-shared information. Experiments show that CHIP achieves the highest forget-retain performance gap across all hierarchy levels while maintaining competitive downstream utility compared to existing methods. Overall, MedForget provides a practical, HIPAA-aligned benchmark for evaluating structured multimodal unlearning for medical data, and CHIP offers an effective and general solution for hierarchy-aware forgetting that balances deletion with utility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Dataset and Code: https://github.com/fengli-wu/MedForget</p></details> |

Yet, elucidating which prior tokens most strongly influence a given prediction remains challenging due to the proliferation of layers and attention heads in modern architectures. We propose Jacobian Scopes, a suite of gradient-based, token-level causal attribution methods for interpreting LLM predictions. By analyzing the linearized relations of final hidden state with respect to inputs, Jacobian Scopes quantify how input tokens influence a model's prediction. We introduce three variants - Semantic, Fisher, and Temperature Scopes - which respectively target sensitivity of specific logits, the full predictive distribution, and model confidence (inverse temperature). Through case studies spanning instruction understanding, translation and in-context learning (ICL), we uncover interesting findings, such as when Jacobian Scopes point to implicit political biases. We believe that our proposed methods also shed light on recently debated mechanisms underlying in-context time-series forecasting. Our code and interactive demonstrations are publicly available at https://github.com/AntonioLiu97/JacobianScopes.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 15 figures, under review at ACL 2026</p></details> |
| **[Towards a Theoretical Understanding to the Generalization of RLHF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16403v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and its variants have emerged as the dominant approaches for aligning Large Language Models with human intent. While empirically effective, the theoretical generalization properties of these methods in high-dimensional settings remain to be explored. To this end, we build the generalization theory on RLHF of LLMs under the linear reward model, through the framework of algorithmic stability. In contrast to the existing works built upon the consistency of maximum likelihood estimations on reward model, our analysis is presented under an end-to-end learning framework, which is consistent with practice. Concretely, we prove that under a key \textbf{feature coverage} condition, the empirical optima of policy model have a generalization bound of order $\mathcal{O}(n^{-\frac{1}{2}})$. Moreover, the results can be extrapolated to parameters obtained by gradient-based learning algorithms, i.e., Gradient Ascent (GA) and Stochastic Gradient Ascent (SGA). Thus, we argue that our results provide new theoretical evidence for the empirically observed generalization of LLMs after RLHF.</p></details> | 31 pages, 6 figures |

The widespread adoption of test-time scaling further intensifies the tension between model capability and resource consumption, highlighting the importance of inference efficiency. However, a unified metric that accurately reflects an LLM's efficiency across diverse model sizes and architectures remains absent. Motivated by the correlation between compression and intelligence, we introduce information capacity, a measure of model efficiency based on text compression performance relative to computational complexity. A distinctive feature of information capacity is its incorporation of tokenizer efficiency, which affects inference costs but is often neglected in LLM evaluations. We assess the information capacity of 52 open-source models and observe a consistent information capacity among different-sized models within a series. Experiments on 5 heterogeneous datasets reveal strong linguistic biases in mainstream LLMs. Three major factors of information capacity include tokenizer efficiency, pretraining data, and the mixture-of-experts architecture. Empirical results verify the accuracy of performance prediction across model sizes based on information capacity and show the correlation between information capacity and benchmark scores.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/TeleAI-AI-Flow/InformationCapacity.

First, current approaches lack a mechanism for automated, data-driven discovery of effective reasoning patterns, relying instead on brittle manual templates or unstable zero-shot prompting. Second, they employ structure-collapsing integration: direct prompting incurs prohibitive online inference costs, while feature extraction collapses reasoning chains into single vectors, discarding stepwise logic. To address these challenges, we propose SCoTER (Structured Chain-of-Thought Transfer for Enhanced Recommendation), a unified framework that treats pattern discovery and structure-aware transfer as a jointly optimized problem. Specifically, SCoTER operationalizes this through two synergistic components: a GVM pipeline for automated pattern discovery and a structure-preserving integration architecture that transfers stepwise logic to efficient models. Formally, we provide information-theoretic justification proving that structure-preserving transfer achieves tighter performance bounds than structure-agnostic alternatives. Empirically, experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate improvements of 3.75\%-11.59\% over a strong TIGER backbone. Moreover, in production deployment on the Tencent Advertising Platform, SCoTER achieved a 2.14\% lift in Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) while eliminating online LLM inference costs. Overall, SCoTER establishes a principled and production-validated blueprint for transferring structured LLM reasoning to large-scale recommender systems.</p></details> |  |

Existing datasets often rely on general-domain corpora or purely textual retrieval, failing to capture the complexity of specialized technical documents where information is inextricably multimodal and reasoning requires synthesizing disjoint evidence. We address this gap by introducing MiRAGE, a Multiagent framework for RAG systems Evaluation, that leverages a collaborative swarm of specialized agents to generate verified, domain-specific, multimodal, and multi-hop Question-Answer datasets. MiRAGE orchestrates a swarm of specialized agents: a recursive context optimization loop to aggregate scattered evidence, an adversarial verifier agent to guarantee factual grounding, and an agent to recognize the expert persona and the relevant domain to mimic expert cognitive workflows. Extensive empirical evaluation across four distinct domains (regulations, finance, quantitative biology, and journalism) demonstrates that MiRAGE generates datasets with significantly higher reasoning complexity (>2.3 average hops) and factual faithfulness. Our ablation studies point that MiRAGE can be powered by LLMs if textual descriptions of the images are available. Visual grounding still remains a frontier. By automating the creation of gold standard evaluation datasets that reflect the latent thematic structure of proprietary corpora, MiRAGE provides the necessary infrastructure to rigorously benchmark the next generation information retrieval systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, Submitted to ACL</p></details> |
| **[Chunking, Retrieval, and Re-ranking: An Empirical Evaluation of RAG Architectures for Policy Document Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15457v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into the public health policy sector offers a transformative approach to navigating the vast repositories of regulatory guidance maintained by agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). However, the propensity for LLMs to generate hallucinations, defined as plausible but factually incorrect assertions, presents a critical barrier to the adoption of these technologies in high-stakes environments where information integrity is non-negotiable. This empirical evaluation explores the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures in mitigating these risks by grounding generative outputs in authoritative document context. Specifically, this study compares a baseline Vanilla LLM against Basic RAG and Advanced RAG pipelines utilizing cross-encoder re-ranking. The experimental framework employs a Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 model and an all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embedding model to process a corpus of official CDC policy analytical frameworks and guidance documents. The analysis measures the impact of two distinct chunking strategies, recursive character-based and token-based semantic splitting, on system accuracy, measured through faithfulness and relevance scores across a curated set of complex policy scenarios. Quantitative findings indicate that while Basic RAG architectures provide a substantial improvement in faithfulness (0.621) over Vanilla baselines (0.347), the Advanced RAG configuration achieves a superior faithfulness average of 0.797. These results demonstrate that two-stage retrieval mechanisms are essential for achieving the precision required for domain-specific policy question answering, though structural constraints in document segmentation remain a significant bottleneck for multi-step reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |

We evaluate whether domain knowledge graphs (KGs) improve Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for healthcare by constructing three PubMed-derived graphs: $\mathbb{G}_1$ (T2DM), $\mathbb{G}_2$ (Alzheimer's disease), and $\mathbb{G}_3$ (AD+T2DM). We design two probes: Probe 1 targets merged AD T2DM knowledge, while Probe 2 targets the intersection of $\mathbb{G}_1$ and $\mathbb{G}_2$. Seven instruction-tuned LLMs are tested across retrieval sources {No-RAG, $\mathbb{G}_1$, $\mathbb{G}_2$, $\mathbb{G}_1$ + $\mathbb{G}_2$, $\mathbb{G}_3$, $\mathbb{G}_1$+$\mathbb{G}_2$ + $\mathbb{G}_3$} and three decoding temperatures. Results show that scope alignment between probe and KG is decisive: precise, scope-matched retrieval (notably $\mathbb{G}_2$) yields the most consistent gains, whereas indiscriminate graph unions often introduce distractors that reduce accuracy. Larger models frequently match or exceed KG-RAG with a No-RAG baseline on Probe 1, indicating strong parametric priors, whereas smaller/mid-sized models benefit more from well-scoped retrieval. Temperature plays a secondary role; higher values rarely help. We conclude that precision-first, scope-matched KG-RAG is preferable to breadth-first unions, and we outline practical guidelines for graph selection, model sizing, and retrieval/reranking.

| **[What Should I Cite? A RAG Benchmark for Academic Citation Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14949v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of Web-based academic publications, more and more papers are being published annually, making it increasingly difficult to find relevant prior work. Citation prediction aims to automatically suggest appropriate references, helping scholars navigate the expanding scientific literature. Here we present \textbf{CiteRAG}, the first comprehensive retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-integrated benchmark for evaluating large language models on academic citation prediction, featuring a multi-level retrieval strategy, specialized retrievers, and generators. Our benchmark makes four core contributions: (1) We establish two instances of the citation prediction task with different granularity. Task 1 focuses on coarse-grained list-specific citation prediction, while Task 2 targets fine-grained position-specific citation prediction. To enhance these two tasks, we build a dataset containing 7,267 instances for Task 1 and 8,541 instances for Task 2, enabling comprehensive evaluation of both retrieval and generation. (2) We construct a three-level large-scale corpus with 554k papers spanning many major subfields, using an incremental pipeline. (3) We propose a multi-level hybrid RAG approach for citation prediction, fine-tuning embedding models with contrastive learning to capture complex citation relationships, paired with specialized generation models. (4) We conduct extensive experiments across state-of-the-art language models, including closed-source APIs, open-source models, and our fine-tuned generators, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework. Our open-source toolkit enables reproducible evaluation and focuses on academic literature, providing the first comprehensive evaluation framework for citation prediction and serving as a methodological template for other scientific domains.

Most notably, indirect prompt injection and retrieval poisoning attack the web-native carriers that survive ingestion pipelines and are very concerning. We provide OpenRAG-Soc, a compact, reproducible benchmark-and-harness for web-facing RAG evaluation under these threats, in a discrete data package. The suite combines a social corpus with interchangeable sparse and dense retrievers and deployable mitigations - HTML/Markdown sanitization, Unicode normalization, and attribution-gated answered. It standardizes end-to-end evaluation from ingestion to generation and reports attacks time of one of the responses at answer time, rank shifts in both sparse and dense retrievers, utility and latency, allowing for apples-to-apples comparisons across carriers and defenses. OpenRAG-Soc targets practitioners who need fast, and realistic tests to track risk and harden deployments.</p></details> | WWW 2026 |

The challenge aims to address a critical limitation of modern Vision Language Models (VLMs): their propensity to hallucinate, especially when faced with egocentric imagery, long-tail entities, and complex, multi-hop questions. This issue is particularly problematic in real-world applications where users pose fact-seeking queries that demand high factual accuracy across diverse modalities. To tackle this, we propose a robust, multi-stage framework that prioritizes factual accuracy and truthfulness over completeness. Our solution integrates a lightweight query router for efficiency, a query-aware retrieval and summarization pipeline, a dual-pathways generation and a post-hoc verification. This conservative strategy is designed to minimize hallucinations, which incur a severe penalty in the competition's scoring metric. Our approach achieved 3rd place in Task 1, demonstrating the effectiveness of prioritizing answer reliability in complex multi-modal RAG systems.

Most existing design methods focus on vector-valued responses (e.g., Young's modulus and bandgap width), while the inverse design of functional responses remains challenging due to their high-dimensionality, the complexity of accommodating design requirements in inverse-design frameworks, and non-existence or non-uniqueness of feasible solutions. Although generative design approaches have shown promise, they are often data-hungry, handle design requirements heuristically, and may generate infeasible designs without uncertainty quantification. To address these challenges, we introduce a RAndom-forest-based Generative approach (RAG). By leveraging the small-data compatibility of random forests, RAG enables data-efficient predictions of high-dimensional functional responses. During the inverse design, the framework estimates the likelihood through the ensemble which quantifies the trustworthiness of generated designs while reflecting the relative difficulty across different requirements. The one-to-many mapping is addressed through single-shot design generation by sampling from the conditional likelihood. We demonstrate RAG on: 1) acoustic metamaterials with prescribed partial passbands/stopbands, and 2) mechanical metamaterials with targeted snap-through responses, using 500 and 1057 samples, respectively. Its data-efficiency is benchmarked against neural networks on a public mechanical metamaterial dataset with nonlinear stress-strain relations. Our framework provides a lightweight, trustworthy pathway to inverse design involving functional responses, expensive simulations, and complex design requirements, beyond metamaterials.</p></details> |  |
| **[Insider Knowledge: How Much Can RAG Systems Gain from Evaluation Secrets?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13227v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RAG systems are increasingly evaluated and optimized using LLM judges, an approach that is rapidly becoming the dominant paradigm for system assessment. Nugget-based approaches in particular are now embedded not only in evaluation frameworks but also in the architectures of RAG systems themselves. While this integration can lead to genuine improvements, it also creates a risk of faulty measurements due to circularity. In this paper, we investigate this risk through comparative experiments with nugget-based RAG systems, including Ginger and Crucible, against strong baselines such as GPT-Researcher. By deliberately modifying Crucible to generate outputs optimized for an LLM judge, we show that near-perfect evaluation scores can be achieved when elements of the evaluation - such as prompt templates or gold nuggets - are leaked or can be predicted. Our results highlight the importance of blind evaluation settings and methodological diversity to guard against mistaking metric overfitting for genuine system progress.</p></details> |  |

However, co-locating the vector retriever and the LLM on shared GPU infrastructure introduces significant challenges: vector search is memory and I/O intensive, while LLM inference demands high throughput and low latency. Naive resource sharing often leads to severe performance degradation, particularly under high request load or large index sizes. We present VectorLiteRAG, a deployment-friendly RAG system that achieves latency-compliant inference without requiring additional hardware resources. VectorLiteRAG introduces a fine-grained GPU resource allocation mechanism based on detailed performance modeling and access pattern analysis. By estimating search latency and query hit rate distributions, it identifies an optimal index partitioning point across CPU and GPU tiers to minimize contention and maximize throughput. Our evaluations show that VectorLiteRAG consistently expands the SLO compliant request rate range across all tested configurations, including both small and large LLMs, and small and large vector databases compared to naive baselines and state of the art alternatives. In the best case, VectorLiteRAG improves the attainable SLO throughput by up to 1.5 times without compromising generation quality or requiring additional compute resources.</p></details> |  |

However, the performance of a RAG system is not determined by a single component but emerges from a complex interplay of modular choices, such as embedding models and retrieval algorithms. This creates a vast and often opaque configuration space, making it challenging for developers to understand performance trade-offs and identify optimal designs. To address this challenge, we present RAGExplorer, a visual analytics system for the systematic comparison and diagnosis of RAG configurations. RAGExplorer guides users through a seamless macro-to-micro analytical workflow. Initially, it empowers developers to survey the performance landscape across numerous configurations, allowing for a high-level understanding of which design choices are most effective. For a deeper analysis, the system enables users to drill down into individual failure cases, investigate how differences in retrieved information contribute to errors, and interactively test hypotheses by manipulating the provided context to observe the resulting impact on the generated answer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RAGExplorer through detailed case studies and user studies, validating its ability to empower developers in navigating the complex RAG design space.

This increase leads to higher computational costs and longer Time to First Token (TTFT). To mitigate this issue, existing solutions aim to reuse the preprocessed KV cache of each retrieved chunk to accelerate RAG. However, the lack of cross-chunk contextual information leads to a significant drop in generation quality, leaving the potential benefits of KV cache reuse largely unfulfilled. The challenge lies in how to reuse the precomputed KV cache of chunks while preserving generation quality. We propose FusionRAG, a novel inference framework that optimizes both the preprocessing and reprocessing stages of RAG. In the offline preprocessing stage, we embed information from other related text chunks into each chunk, while in the online reprocessing stage, we recompute the KV cache for tokens that the model focuses on. As a result, we achieve a better trade-off between generation quality and efficiency. According to our experiments, FusionRAG significantly improves generation quality at the same recomputation ratio compared to previous state-of-the-art solutions. By recomputing fewer than 15% of the tokens, FusionRAG achieves up to 70% higher normalized F1 scores than baselines and reduces TTFT by 2.66x-9.39x compared to Full Attention.</p></details> |  |

By refining retrieval processes and improving contextual grounding, our approach improves both answer accuracy and informativeness.

Existing pre-generation filters rely on heuristics or uncalibrated LLM confidence scores, offering no statistical control over retained evidence. We evaluate and demonstrate context engineering through conformal prediction, a coverage-controlled filtering framework that removes irrelevant content while preserving recall of supporting evidence. Using both embedding- and LLM-based scoring functions, we test this approach on the NeuCLIR and RAGTIME collections. Conformal filtering consistently meets its target coverage, ensuring that a specified fraction of relevant snippets are retained, and reduces retained context by 2-3x relative to unfiltered retrieval. On NeuCLIR, downstream factual accuracy measured by ARGUE F1 improves under strict filtering and remains stable at moderate coverage, indicating that most discarded material is redundant or irrelevant. These results demonstrate that conformal prediction enables reliable, coverage-controlled context reduction in RAG, offering a model-agnostic and principled approach to context engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECIR 2026</p></details> |

Stakeholders require traceable evidence, clear rationales for why specific evidence is selected, and safeguards against poisoned or misleading content. Yet current RAG pipelines rely on similarity-based retrieval with arbitrary top-k cutoffs, provide no explanation for selections, and remain vulnerable to poisoning attacks. We propose METEORA, which replaces these drawbacks with rationale-driven selection, using explicit reasoning to guide evidence choice, explain decisions, and improve robustness to RAG poisoning. METEORA operates in three stages: (1) a general-purpose LLM is preference-tuned to generate query-conditioned rationales using direct preference optimization; (2) these rationales drive an Evidence Chunk Selection Engine that pairs rationales with retrieved evidence for query-specific relevance and applies elbow detection to choose an adaptive cutoff (optionally expanding context with neighboring chunks); and (3) a Verifier LLM uses the rationales to detect and filter poisoned or misleading evidence before generation. Across six datasets, METEORA achieves 13.41% higher recall and, without expansion, 21.05% higher precision than the strongest baseline. It reduces the evidence needed for comparable recall by 80%, improving downstream answer accuracy by 33.34%, and strengthens adversarial defense by increasing F1 from 0.10 to 0.44.

Out-of-domain (OOD) queries can cause dense retrieval to surface weakly related context and lead the generator to produce fluent but unjustified responses. We study lightweight, KB-aligned OOD detection as an always-on gate for RAG systems. Our approach applies PCA to KB embeddings and scores queries in a compact subspace selected either by explained-variance retention (EVR) or by a separability-driven t-test ranking. We evaluate geometric semantic-search rules and lightweight classifiers across 16 domains, including high-stakes COVID-19 and Substance Use KBs, and stress-test robustness using both LLM-generated attacks and an in-the-wild 4chan attack. We find that low-dimensional detectors achieve competitive OOD performance while being faster, cheaper, and more interpretable than prompted LLM-based judges. Finally, human and LLM-based evaluations show that OOD queries primarily degrade the relevance of RAG outputs, showing the need for efficient external OOD detection to maintain safe, in-scope behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Effective and Unsupervised Social Event Detection and Evolution via RAG and Structural Entropy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12035v1)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing scale of social media, social event detection and evolution modeling have attracted increasing attention. Graph neural networks (GNNs) and transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs) have become mainstream approaches in this area. However, existing methods still face three major challenges. First, the sheer volume of social media messages makes learning resource-intensive. Second, the fragmentation of social media messages often impedes the model's ability to capture a comprehensive view of the events. Third, the lack of structured temporal context has hindered the development of effective models for event evolution, limiting users' access to event information. To address these challenges, we propose a foundation model for unsupervised Social Event Detection and Evolution, namely RagSEDE. Specifically, RagSEDE introduces a representativeness- and diversity-driven sampling strategy to extract key messages from massive social streams, significantly reducing noise and computational overhead. It further establishes a novel paradigm based on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that enhances PLMs in detecting events while simultaneously constructing and maintaining an evolving event knowledge base. Finally, RagSEDE leverages structural information theory to dynamically model event evolution keywords for the first time. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the superiority of RagSEDE in open-world social event detection and evolution.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, accepted for The Web Conference (WWW) 2026</p></details> |

A Fact-Checking Dataset for Evaluating the Robustness of RAG Against Misleading Retrievals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16101v5)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has shown impressive capabilities in mitigating hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs struggle to maintain consistent reasoning when exposed to misleading or conflicting evidence, especially in real-world domains such as politics, where information is polarized or selectively framed. Mainstream RAG benchmarks evaluate models under clean retrieval settings, where systems generate answers from gold-standard documents, or under synthetically perturbed settings, where documents are artificially injected with noise. These assumptions fail to reflect real-world conditions, often leading to an overestimation of RAG system performance. To address this gap, we introduce RAGuard, the first benchmark to evaluate the robustness of RAG systems against misleading retrievals. Unlike prior benchmarks that rely on synthetic noise, our fact-checking dataset captures naturally occurring misinformation by constructing its retrieval corpus from Reddit discussions. It categorizes retrieved evidence into three types: supporting, misleading, and unrelated, providing a realistic and challenging testbed for assessing how well RAG systems navigate different types of evidence. Our experiments reveal that, when exposed to potentially misleading retrievals, all tested LLM-powered RAG systems perform worse than their zero-shot baselines (i.e., no retrieval at all), while human annotators consistently perform better, highlighting LLMs' susceptibility to noisy environments. To our knowledge, RAGuard is the first benchmark to systematically assess the robustness of the RAG against misleading evidence. We expect this benchmark to drive future research toward improving RAG systems beyond idealized datasets, making them more reliable for real-world applications. The dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/UCSC-IRKM/RAGuard.</p></details> | <details><summary>Advan...</summary><p>Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

Current LLMs are trained on large code datasets and are capable of writing IEC 61131-3 compatible code out of the box, but they neither know specific function blocks, nor related project code. Moreover, companies like Mitsubishi Electric and their customers do not trust cloud providers. Hence, an own coding agent is the desired solution to cope with this. In this study, we present our work on a low-data domain coding assistant solution for industrial use. We show how we achieved high quality code generation without fine-tuning large models and by fine-tuning small local models for edge device usage. Our tool lets several AI models compete with each other, uses reasoning, corrects bugs automatically and checks code validity by compiling it directly in the chat interface. We support our approach with an extensive evaluation that comes with code compilation statistics and user ratings. We found that a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) supported coding assistant can work in low-data domains by using extensive prompt engineering and directed retrieval.</p></details> | ICIT2026 |
| **[FACTUM: Mechanistic Detection of Citation Hallucination in Long-Form RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05866v2)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models are critically undermined by citation hallucinations, a deceptive failure where a model cites a source that fails to support its claim. While existing work attributes hallucination to a simple over-reliance on parametric knowledge, we reframe this failure as an evolving, scale-dependent coordination failure between the Attention (reading) and Feed-Forward Network (recalling) pathways. We introduce FACTUM (Framework for Attesting Citation Trustworthiness via Underlying Mechanisms), a framework of four mechanistic scores: Contextual Alignment (CAS), Attention Sink Usage (BAS), Parametric Force (PFS), and Pathway Alignment (PAS). Our analysis reveals that correct citations are consistently marked by higher parametric force (PFS) and greater use of the attention sink (BAS) for information synthesis. Crucially, we find that "one-size-fits-all" theories are insufficient as the signature of correctness evolves with scale: while the 3B model relies on high pathway alignment (PAS), our best-performing 8B detector identifies a shift toward a specialized strategy where pathways provide distinct, orthogonal information. By capturing this complex interplay, FACTUM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 37.5% in AUC. Our results demonstrate that high parametric force is constructive when successfully coordinated with the Attention pathway, paving the way for more nuanced and reliable RAG systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECIR 2026. 13 pages, 2 figures</p></details> |

However, existing ranking models are primarily optimized for query--document relevance, which often misaligns with generators' preferences for evidence selection and citation, limiting their impact on response quality. Moreover, most approaches do not account for preference differences across generators, resulting in unstable cross-generator performance. We propose \textbf{Rank4Gen}, a generator-aware ranker for RAG that targets the goal of \emph{Ranking for Generators}. Rank4Gen introduces two key preference modeling strategies: (1) \textbf{From Ranking Relevance to Response Quality}, which optimizes ranking with respect to downstream response quality rather than query--document relevance; and (2) \textbf{Generator-Specific Preference Modeling}, which conditions a single ranker on different generators to capture their distinct ranking preferences. To enable such modeling, we construct \textbf{PRISM}, a dataset built from multiple open-source corpora and diverse downstream generators. Experiments on five challenging and recent RAG benchmarks demonstrate that RRank4Gen achieves strong and competitive performance for complex evidence composition in RAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[SD-RAG: A Prompt-Injection-Resilient Framework for Selective Disclosure in Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11199v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has attracted significant attention due to its ability to combine the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with knowledge obtained through efficient retrieval mechanisms over large-scale data collections. Currently, the majority of existing approaches overlook the risks associated with exposing sensitive or access-controlled information directly to the generation model. Only a few approaches propose techniques to instruct the generative model to refrain from disclosing sensitive information; however, recent studies have also demonstrated that LLMs remain vulnerable to prompt injection attacks that can override intended behavioral constraints. For these reasons, we propose a novel approach to Selective Disclosure in Retrieval-Augmented Generation, called SD-RAG, which decouples the enforcement of security and privacy constraints from the generation process itself. Rather than relying on prompt-level safeguards, SD-RAG applies sanitization and disclosure controls during the retrieval phase, prior to augmenting the language model's input. Moreover, we introduce a semantic mechanism to allow the ingestion of human-readable dynamic security and privacy constraints together with an optimized graph-based data model that supports fine-grained, policy-aware retrieval. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the superiority of SD-RAG over baseline existing approaches, achieving up to a $58\%$ improvement in the privacy score, while also showing a strong resilience to prompt injection attacks targeting the generative model.</p></details> |  |
| **[NAACL: Noise-AwAre Verbal Confidence Calibration for LLMs in RAG Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11004v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately assessing model confidence is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) in mission-critical factual domains. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is widely adopted to improve grounding, confidence calibration in RAG settings remains poorly understood. We conduct a systematic study across four benchmarks, revealing that LLMs exhibit poor calibration performance due to noisy retrieved contexts. Specifically, contradictory or irrelevant evidence tends to inflate the model's false certainty, leading to severe overconfidence. To address this, we propose NAACL Rules (Noise-AwAre Confidence CaLibration Rules) to provide a principled foundation for resolving overconfidence under noise. We further design NAACL, a noise-aware calibration framework that synthesizes supervision from about 2K HotpotQA examples guided by these rules. By performing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with this data, NAACL equips models with intrinsic noise awareness without relying on stronger teacher models. Empirical results show that NAACL yields substantial gains, improving ECE scores by 10.9% in-domain and 8.0% out-of-domain. By bridging the gap between retrieval noise and verbal calibration, NAACL paves the way for both accurate and epistemically reliable LLMs.</p></details> |  |

While scaling generators often improves accuracy, it also increases inference and deployment overhead. We study an orthogonal axis: enlarging the retriever's corpus, and how it trades off with generator scale. Across multiple open-domain QA benchmarks, corpus scaling consistently strengthens RAG and can in many cases match the gains of moving to a larger model tier, though with diminishing returns at larger scales. Small- and mid-sized generators paired with larger corpora often rival much larger models with smaller corpora; mid-sized models tend to gain the most, while tiny and very large models benefit less. Our analysis suggests that these improvements arise primarily from increased coverage of answer-bearing passages, while utilization efficiency remains largely unchanged. Overall, our results characterize a corpus-generator trade-off in RAG and provide empirical guidance on how corpus scale and model capacity interact in this setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceeding Version of ECIR 2026</p></details> |

They are not just text, nor just numbers; they are a complex amalgam of narrative and structure. Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have attempted to address this complexity with a blunt tool: linearization. We convert rich, multidimensional tables into simple Markdown-style text strings, hoping that an embedding model will capture the geometry of a spreadsheet in a single vector. But it has already been shown that this is mathematically insufficient. This work presents Topo-RAG, a framework that challenges the assumption that "everything is text". We propose a dual architecture that respects the topology of the data: we route fluid narrative through traditional dense retrievers, while tabular structures are processed by a Cell-Aware Late Interaction mechanism, preserving their spatial relationships. Evaluated on SEC-25, a synthetic enterprise corpus that mimics real-world complexity, Topo-RAG demonstrates an 18.4% improvement in nDCG@10 on hybrid queries compared to standard linearization approaches. It's not just about searching better; it's about understanding the shape of information.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disco-RAG: Discourse-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04377v3)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as an important means of enhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, most existing RAG strategies treat retrieved passages in a flat and unstructured way, which prevents the model from capturing structural cues and constrains its ability to synthesize knowledge from dispersed evidence across documents. To overcome these limitations, we propose Disco-RAG, a discourse-aware framework that explicitly injects discourse signals into the generation process. Our method constructs intra-chunk discourse trees to capture local hierarchies and builds inter-chunk rhetorical graphs to model cross-passage coherence. These structures are jointly integrated into a planning blueprint that conditions the generation. Experiments on question answering and long-document summarization benchmarks show the efficacy of our approach. Disco-RAG achieves state-of-the-art results on the benchmarks without fine-tuning. These findings underscore the important role of discourse structure in advancing RAG systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAG-3DSG: Enhancing 3D Scene Graphs with Re-Shot Guided Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10168v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary 3D Scene Graph (3DSG) generation can enhance various downstream tasks in robotics, such as manipulation and navigation, by leveraging structured semantic representations. A 3DSG is constructed from multiple images of a scene, where objects are represented as nodes and relationships as edges. However, existing works for open-vocabulary 3DSG generation suffer from both low object-level recognition accuracy and speed, mainly due to constrained viewpoints, occlusions, and redundant surface density. To address these challenges, we propose RAG-3DSG to mitigate aggregation noise through re-shot guided uncertainty estimation and support object-level Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) via reliable low-uncertainty objects. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic downsample-mapping strategy to accelerate cross-image object aggregation with adaptive granularity. Experiments on Replica dataset demonstrate that RAG-3DSG significantly improves node captioning accuracy in 3DSG generation while reducing the mapping time by two-thirds compared to the vanilla version.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

We quantify this challenge using Dhao, an indigenous language of Eastern Indonesia with no digital footprint beyond the New Testament (NT). When applied to the unseen Old Testament (OT), a standard NMT model fine-tuned on the NT drops from an in-domain score of 36.17 chrF++ to 27.11 chrF++. To recover this loss, we introduce a hybrid framework where a fine-tuned NMT model generates an initial draft, which is then refined by a Large Language Model (LLM) using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The final system achieves 35.21 chrF++ (+8.10 recovery), effectively matching the original in-domain quality. Our analysis reveals that this performance is driven primarily by the number of retrieved examples rather than the choice of retrieval algorithm. Qualitative analysis confirms the LLM acts as a robust "safety net," repairing severe failures in zero-shot domains.</p></details> |  |

However, multimodal retrieval-augmented diagnosis is highly challenging. We explore a lightweight mechanism for enhancing diagnostic performance of retrieval-augmented LVLMs. We train a lightweight LVLM-aware multimodal retriever, such that the retriever learns to return images and texts that guide the LVLM toward correct predictions. In our low-resource setting, we perform only lightweight fine-tuning with small amounts of data, and use only general-purpose backbone models, achieving competitive results in clinical classification and VQA tasks compared to medically pre-trained models with extensive training. In a novel analysis, we highlight a previously unexplored class of errors that we term inconsistent retrieval predictions: cases where different top-retrieved images yield different predictions for the same target. We find that these cases are challenging for all models, even for non-retrieval models, and that our retrieval optimization mechanism significantly improves these cases over standard RAG. However, our analysis also sheds light on gaps in the ability of LVLMs to utilize retrieved information for clinical predictions.

These manuals, written in natural language, describe many steps in detail. Unfortunately, the number, magnitude, and articulation of these descriptions can significantly slow down and complicate the retrieval of the correct procedure during critical incidents. Interestingly, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enables the development of tools based on conversational interfaces that can assist operators in their retrieval tasks, improving their capability to respond to incidents. This paper presents the results of a set of experiments that derive from the analysis of the troubleshooting procedures available in Fincantieri, a large international company developing complex naval cyber-physical systems. Results show that RAG can assist operators in reacting promptly to failure symptoms, although specific measures have to be taken into consideration to cross-validate recommendations before actuating them.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in the Software Engineering in Practice track at the 48th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2026)</p></details> |

Despite advancements in NLP, poetry remains underexplored due to its complex figurative language and cultural specificity. We constructed a multi-label dataset of 7,662 entries (7,007 line-level and 615 work-level), annotated with 44 fine-grained emotion categories from five influential Korean poets. The KPoEM emotion classification model, fine-tuned through a sequential strategy -- moving from general-purpose corpora to the specialized KPoEM dataset -- achieved an F1-micro score of 0.60, significantly outperforming previous models (0.43). The model demonstrates an enhanced ability to identify temporally and culturally specific emotional expressions while preserving core poetic sentiments. Furthermore, applying the structured emotion dataset to a RAG-based poetry generation model demonstrates the empirical feasibility of generating texts that reflect the emotional and cultural sensibilities of Korean literature. This integrated approach strengthens the connection between computational techniques and literary analysis, opening new pathways for quantitative emotion research and generative poetics. Overall, this study provides a foundation for advancing emotion-centered analysis and creation in modern Korean poetry.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 22 tables, 3 figures, Digital Humanities and Social Sciences Korea Conference, James Joo-Jin Kim Center for Korean Studies, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA</p></details> |

The quality of generated content heavily relies on the usefulness of the retrieved information and the capacity of LLMs' internal information processing mechanism to incorporate it in answer generation. It is generally assumed that the retrieved information is relevant to the question. However, the retrieved information may have a variable degree of relevance and usefulness, depending on the question and the document collection. It is important to take into account the relevance of the retrieved information in answer generation. In this paper, we propose OpenDecoder, a new approach that leverages explicit evaluation of the retrieved information as quality indicator features for generation. We aim to build a RAG model that is more robust to varying levels of noisy context. Three types of explicit evaluation information are considered: relevance score, ranking score, and QPP (query performance prediction) score. The experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and better robustness of OpenDecoder by outperforming various baseline methods. Importantly, this paradigm is flexible to be integrated with the post-training of LLMs for any purposes and incorporated with any type of external indicators.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM WWW 2026</p></details> |

This paper benchmarks three retrieval pipelines on Java codebases (Shopizer, with additional runs on ThingsBoard and OpenMRS Core): (A) vector-only No-Graph RAG, (B) an LLM-generated knowledge graph RAG (LLM-KB), and (C) a deterministic AST-derived knowledge graph RAG (DKB) built with Tree-sitter and bidirectional traversal. Using 15 architecture and code-tracing queries per repository, we measure indexing time, query latency, corpus coverage, cost, and answer correctness. DKB builds its graph in seconds, while LLM-KB requires much longer graph generation. LLM-KB also shows indexing incompleteness: on Shopizer, 377 files are skipped or missed, reducing embedded chunk coverage and graph size compared to DKB. End-to-end cost is modest for DKB relative to the vector-only baseline but much higher for LLM-KB, especially as repository scale increases. Query latency is similar for No-Graph and DKB, while LLM-KB is slower and more variable. On the Shopizer question suite, DKB achieves the highest correctness, LLM-KB is close behind, and the vector-only baseline performs worst on upstream architectural queries and has the highest hallucination risk. Overall, deterministic AST-derived graphs provide more reliable coverage and multi-hop grounding than LLM-extracted graphs at substantially lower indexing cost.</p></details> | 46 pages, 2 figures |

However, the development of robust agents is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality training data that reflects the noise and complexity of real-world retrieval environments. Conventional manual annotation is unscalable and often fails to capture the dynamic reasoning strategies required to handle retrieval failures. To bridge this gap, we introduce RAGShaper, a novel data synthesis framework designed to automate the construction of RAG tasks and robust agent trajectories. RAGShaper incorporates an InfoCurator to build dense information trees enriched with adversarial distractors spanning Perception and Cognition levels. Furthermore, we propose a constrained navigation strategy that forces a teacher agent to confront these distractors, thereby eliciting trajectories that explicitly demonstrate error correction and noise rejection. Comprehensive experiments confirm that models trained on our synthesized corpus significantly outperform existing baselines, exhibiting superior robustness in noise-intensive and complex retrieval tasks.</p></details> |  |

While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrated with Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a solution, these methods are fundamentally constrained by a single-query mode, leading to prohibitive latency and inherent brittleness. To overcome these limitations, we introduce RAG-R1, a novel two-stage training framework centered around multi-query parallelism. Our framework enables LLMs to adaptively leverage internal and external knowledge during the reasoning process while transitioning from the single-query mode to multi-query parallelism. This architectural shift bolsters reasoning robustness while significantly reducing inference latency. Extensive experiments on seven question-answering benchmarks confirm the superiority of our method, which outperforms the strongest baseline by up to 13.7% and decreases inference time by 11.1%.</p></details> |  |

| **[Is Agentic RAG worth it? An experimental comparison of RAG approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07711v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are usually defined by the combination of a generator and a retrieval component that extracts textual context from a knowledge base to answer user queries. However, such basic implementations exhibit several limitations, including noisy or suboptimal retrieval, misuse of retrieval for out-of-scope queries, weak query-document matching, and variability or cost associated with the generator. These shortcomings have motivated the development of "Enhanced" RAG, where dedicated modules are introduced to address specific weaknesses in the workflow. More recently, the growing self-reflective capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a new paradigm, which we refer to as "Agentic" RAG. In this approach, the LLM orchestrates the entire process-deciding which actions to perform, when to perform them, and whether to iterate-thereby reducing reliance on fixed, manually engineered modules. Despite the rapid adoption of both paradigms, it remains unclear which approach is preferable under which conditions. In this work, we conduct an extensive, empirically driven evaluation of Enhanced and Agentic RAG across multiple scenarios and dimensions. Our results provide practical insights into the trade-offs between the two paradigms, offering guidance on selecting the most effective RAG design for real-world applications, considering both costs and performance.</p></details> |  |

Yet standard MCQ/MRC-style evaluations do not capture key real-world failure modes, notably free-form hallucinations and whether models appropriately abstain when evidence is lacking. To shed a light on this aspect we introduce ISLAMICFAITHQA, a 3,810-item bilingual (Arabic/English) generative benchmark with atomic single-gold answers, which enables direct measurement of hallucination and abstention. We additionally developed an end-to-end grounded Islamic modelling suite consisting of (i) 25K Arabic text-grounded SFT reasoning pairs, (ii) 5K bilingual preference samples for reward-guided alignment, and (iii) a verse-level Qur'an retrieval corpus of $\sim$6k atomic verses (ayat). Building on these resources, we develop an agentic Quran-grounding framework (agentic RAG) that uses structured tool calls for iterative evidence seeking and answer revision. Experiments across Arabic-centric and multilingual LLMs show that retrieval improves correctness and that agentic RAG yields the largest gains beyond standard RAG, achieving state-of-the-art performance and stronger Arabic-English robustness even with a small model (i.e., Qwen3 4B). We will make the experimental resources and datasets publicly available for the community.</p></details> |  |

However, the complexity of developing, evaluating, and iterating on LLM-based agent workflows presents significant barriers to researchers, particularly those without extensive software engineering expertise. We present FROAV (Framework for RAG Observation and Agent Verification), an open-source research platform that democratizes LLM agent research by providing a plug-and-play architecture combining visual workflow orchestration, a comprehensive evaluation framework, and extensible Python integration. FROAV implements a multi-stage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline coupled with a rigorous "LLM-as-a-Judge" evaluation system, all accessible through intuitive graphical interfaces. Our framework integrates n8n for no-code workflow design, PostgreSQL for granular data management, FastAPI for flexible backend logic, and Streamlit for human-in-the-loop interaction. Through this integrated ecosystem, researchers can rapidly prototype RAG strategies, conduct prompt engineering experiments, validate agent performance against human judgments, and collect structured feedback-all without writing infrastructure code. We demonstrate the framework's utility through its application to financial document analysis, while emphasizing its material-agnostic architecture that adapts to any domain requiring semantic analysis. FROAV represents a significant step toward making LLM agent research accessible to a broader scientific community, enabling researchers to focus on hypothesis testing and algorithmic innovation rather than system integration challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Credible Plan-Driven RAG Method for Multi-Hop Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16787v3)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated strong performance in single-hop question answering (QA) by integrating external knowledge into large language models (LLMs). However, its effectiveness remains limited in multi-hop QA, which demands both stable reasoning and factual consistency. Existing approaches often provide partial solutions, addressing either reasoning trajectory stability or factual verification, but rarely achieving both simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we propose PAR-RAG, a three-stage Plan-then-Act-and-Review framework inspired by the PDCA cycle. PAR-RAG incorporates semantic complexity as a unifying principle through three key components: (i) complexity-aware exemplar selection guides plan generation by aligning decomposition granularity with question difficulty, thereby stabilizing reasoning trajectories; (ii) execution follows a structured retrieve-then-read process; and (iii) dual verification identifies and corrects intermediate errors while dynamically adjusting verification strength based on question complexity: emphasizing accuracy for simple queries and multi-evidence consistency for complex ones. This cognitively inspired framework integrates theoretical grounding with practical robustness. Experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that PAR-RAG consistently outperforms competitive baselines, while ablation studies confirm the complementary roles of complexity-aware planning and dual verification. Collectively, these results establish PAR-RAG as a robust and generalizable framework for reliable multi-hop reasoning.</p></details> | 24 pages, 7 figures |

Benchmarking and Empirical Insights into Reasoning under Incomplete Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08344v4)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) is an increasingly explored approach for combining the reasoning capabilities of large language models with the structured evidence of knowledge graphs. However, current evaluation practices fall short: existing benchmarks often include questions that can be directly answered using existing triples in KG, making it unclear whether models perform reasoning or simply retrieve answers directly. Moreover, inconsistent evaluation metrics and lenient answer matching criteria further obscure meaningful comparisons. In this work, we introduce a general method for constructing benchmarks and present BRINK (Benchmark for Reasoning under Incomplete Knowledge) to systematically assess KG-RAG methods under knowledge incompleteness. Our empirical results show that current KG-RAG methods have limited reasoning ability under missing knowledge, often rely on internal memorization, and exhibit varying degrees of generalization depending on their design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a main conference paper at EACL 2026</p></details> |

This paper proposes a Tree-RAG acceleration method based on the improved Cuckoo Filter, which optimizes entity localization during the retrieval process to achieve significant performance improvements. Tree-RAG effectively organizes entities through the introduction of a hierarchical tree structure, while the Cuckoo Filter serves as an efficient data structure that supports rapid membership queries and dynamic updates. The experiment results demonstrate that our method is much faster than naive Tree-RAG while maintaining high levels of generative quality. When the number of trees is large, our method is hundreds of times faster than naive Tree-RAG.

While prior work has explored different mechanisms for providing knowledge to LLMs, such as finetuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), their relative effectiveness for multi-hop question answering remains insufficiently understood, particularly when the required knowledge is temporally novel. In this paper, we systematically compare parametric and non-parametric knowledge injection methods for open-domain multi-hop question answering. We evaluate unsupervised fine-tuning (continual pretraining), supervised fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation across three 7B-parameter open-source LLMs. Experiments are conducted on two benchmarks: QASC, a standard multi-hop science question answering dataset, and a newly constructed dataset of over 10,000 multi-hop questions derived from Wikipedia events in 2024, designed to test knowledge beyond the models' pretraining cutoff. Our results show that unsupervised fine-tuning provides only limited gains over base models, suggesting that continual pretraining alone is insufficient for improving multi-hop reasoning accuracy. In contrast, retrieval-augmented generation yields substantial and consistent improvements, particularly when answering questions that rely on temporally novel information. Supervised fine-tuning achieves the highest overall accuracy across models and datasets. These findings highlight fundamental differences in how knowledge injection mechanisms support multi-hop question answering and underscore the importance of retrieval-based methods when external or compositional knowledge is required.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Effectiveness of Proposed Techniques to Reduce Energy Consumption in RAG Systems: A Controlled Experiment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02522v2)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rising energy demands of machine learning (ML), e.g., implemented in popular variants like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, have raised significant concerns about their environmental sustainability. While previous research has proposed green tactics for ML-enabled systems, their empirical evaluation within RAG systems remains largely unexplored. This study presents a controlled experiment investigating five practical techniques aimed at reducing energy consumption in RAG systems. Using a production-like RAG system developed at our collaboration partner, the Software Improvement Group, we evaluated the impact of these techniques on energy consumption, latency, and accuracy. Through a total of 9 configurations spanning over 200 hours of trials using the CRAG dataset, we reveal that techniques such as increasing similarity retrieval thresholds, reducing embedding sizes, applying vector indexing, and using a BM25S reranker can significantly reduce energy usage, up to 60% in some cases. However, several techniques also led to unacceptable accuracy decreases, e.g., by up to 30% for the indexing strategies. Notably, finding an optimal retrieval threshold and reducing embedding size substantially reduced energy consumption and latency with no loss in accuracy, making these two techniques truly energy-efficient. We present the first comprehensive, empirical study on energy-efficient design techniques for RAG systems, providing guidance for developers and researchers aiming to build sustainable RAG applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 2026 International Conference on Software Engineering: Software Engineering in Society (ICSE-SEIS'26)</p></details> |
| **[TreePS-RAG: Tree-based Process Supervision for Reinforcement Learning in Agentic RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06922v1)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) formulates question answering as a multi-step interaction between reasoning and information retrieval, and has recently been advanced by reinforcement learning (RL) with outcome-based supervision. While effective, relying solely on sparse final rewards limits step-wise credit assignment and provides weak guidance for intermediate reasoning and actions. Recent efforts explore process-level supervision, but typically depend on offline constructed training data, which risks distribution shift, or require costly intermediate annotations. We present TreePS-RAG, an online, tree-based RL framework for agentic RAG that enables step-wise credit assignment while retaining standard outcome-only rewards. Our key insight is to model agentic RAG reasoning as a rollout tree, where each reasoning step naturally maps to a node. This tree structure allows step utility to be estimated via Monte Carlo estimation over its descendant outcomes, yielding fine-grained process advantages without requiring intermediate labels. To make this paradigm practical, we introduce an efficient online tree construction strategy that preserves exploration diversity under a constrained computational budget. With a rollout cost comparable to strong baselines like Search-R1, experiments on seven multi-hop and general QA benchmarks across multiple model scales show that TreePS-RAG consistently and significantly outperforms both outcome-supervised and leading process-supervised RL methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[CSR-RAG: An Efficient Retrieval System for Text-to-SQL on the Enterprise Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06564v1)** | 2026-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural language to SQL translation (Text-to-SQL) is one of the long-standing problems that has recently benefited from advances in Large Language Models (LLMs). While most academic Text-to-SQL benchmarks request schema description as a part of natural language input, enterprise-scale applications often require table retrieval before SQL query generation. To address this need, we propose a novel hybrid Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system consisting of contextual, structural, and relational retrieval (CSR-RAG) to achieve computationally efficient yet sufficiently accurate retrieval for enterprise-scale databases. Through extensive enterprise benchmarks, we demonstrate that CSR-RAG achieves up to 40% precision and over 80% recall while incurring a negligible average query generation latency of only 30ms on commodity data center hardware, which makes it appropriate for modern LLM-based enterprise-scale systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[L-RAG: Balancing Context and Retrieval with Entropy-Based Lazy Loading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06551v1)** | 2026-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the predominant paradigm for grounding Large Language Model outputs in factual knowledge, effectively mitigating hallucinations. However, conventional RAG systems operate under a "retrieve-always" assumption, querying vector databases for every input regardless of query complexity. This static approach incurs substantial computational overhead and inference latency, particularly problematic for high-throughput production deployments. We introduce L-RAG (Lazy Retrieval-Augmented Generation), an adaptive framework that implements hierarchical context management through entropy-based gating. L-RAG employs a two-tier architecture: queries are first processed with a compact document summary, and expensive chunk retrieval is triggered only when the model's predictive entropy exceeds a calibrated threshold, signaling genuine uncertainty. Through experiments on SQuAD 2.0 (N=500) using the Phi-2 model, we demonstrate that L-RAG provides a tunable accuracy-efficiency trade-off: at a conservative threshold (tau=0.5), L-RAG achieves 78.2% accuracy, matching Standard RAG (77.8%), with 8% retrieval reduction; at a balanced threshold (tau=1.0), retrieval reduction increases to 26% with modest accuracy trade-off (76.0%). Latency analysis shows that L-RAG saves 80-210ms per query when retrieval latency exceeds 500ms. Analysis of entropy distributions reveals statistically significant separation (p < 0.001) between correct predictions (H=1.72) and errors (H=2.20), validating entropy as a reliable uncertainty signal. L-RAG offers a practical, training-free approach toward more efficient RAG deployment, providing system architects with a configurable knob to balance accuracy and throughput requirements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Controlled Retrieval-augmented Context Evaluation for Long-form RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20051v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models by incorporating context retrieved from external knowledge sources. While the effectiveness of the retrieval module is typically evaluated with relevance-based ranking metrics, such metrics may be insufficient to reflect the retrieval's impact on the final RAG result, especially in long-form generation scenarios. We argue that providing a comprehensive retrieval-augmented context is important for long-form RAG tasks like report generation and propose metrics for assessing the context independent of generation. We introduce CRUX, a \textbf{C}ontrolled \textbf{R}etrieval-a\textbf{U}gmented conte\textbf{X}t evaluation framework designed to directly assess retrieval-augmented contexts. This framework uses human-written summaries to control the information scope of knowledge, enabling us to measure how well the context covers information essential for long-form generation. CRUX uses question-based evaluation to assess RAG's retrieval in a fine-grained manner. Empirical results show that CRUX offers more reflective and diagnostic evaluation. Our findings also reveal substantial room for improvement in current retrieval methods, pointing to promising directions for advancing RAG's retrieval. Our data and code are publicly available to support and advance future research on retrieval.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stable-RAG: Mitigating Retrieval-Permutation-Induced Hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02993v3)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a key paradigm for reducing factual hallucinations in large language models (LLMs), yet little is known about how the order of retrieved documents affects model behavior. We empirically show that under Top-5 retrieval with the gold document included, LLM answers vary substantially across permutations of the retrieved set, even when the gold document is fixed in the first position. This reveals a previously underexplored sensitivity to retrieval permutations. Although robust RAG methods primarily focus on enhancing LLM robustness to low-quality retrieval and mitigating positional bias to distribute attention fairly over long contexts, neither approach directly addresses permutation sensitivity. In this paper, we propose Stable-RAG, which exploits permutation sensitivity estimation to mitigate permutation-induced hallucinations. Stable-RAG runs the generator under multiple retrieval orders, clusters hidden states, and decodes from a cluster-center representation that captures the dominant reasoning pattern. It then uses these reasoning results to align hallucinated outputs toward the correct answer, encouraging the model to produce consistent and accurate predictions across document permutations. Experiments on three QA datasets show that Stable-RAG significantly improves answer accuracy, reasoning consistency and robust generalization across datasets, retrievers, and input lengths compared with baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 13 figures, 8 tables, under review</p></details> |

Traditional documentation is often outdated or incomplete, making it difficult to derive accurate, context-specific explanations. Meanwhile, issue-tracking systems capture rich and continuously updated development knowledge, but their potential for explainability remains untapped. With this work, we are the first to apply a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach for generating explanations from issue-tracking data. Our proof-of-concept system is implemented using open-source tools and language models, demonstrating the feasibility of leveraging structured issue data for explanation generation. Evaluating our approach on an exemplary project's set of GitHub issues, we achieve 90% alignment with human-written explanations. Additionally, our system exhibits strong faithfulness and instruction adherence, ensuring reliable and grounded explanations. These findings suggest that RAG-based methods can extend explainability beyond black-box ML models to a broader range of software systems, provided that issue-tracking data is available - making system behavior more accessible and interpretable.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NLBSE 2026, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil</p></details> |

This has motivated context compression, ranging from token pruning and summarization to embedding-based compression. While researchers have tried ''compressing'' these documents into smaller summaries or mathematical embeddings, there is a catch: the more you compress the data, the more the LLM struggles to understand it. To address this challenge, we propose ArcAligner (Adaptive recursive context *Aligner*), a lightweight module integrated into the language model layers to help the model better utilize highly compressed context representations for downstream generation. It uses an adaptive ''gating'' system that only adds extra processing power when the information is complex, keeping the system fast. Across knowledge-intensive QA benchmarks, ArcAligner consistently beats compression baselines at comparable compression rates, especially on multi-hop and long-tail settings.

Conversely, initial strategies that interleave retrieval with reasoning often lack global corpus awareness, while Knowledge Graph (KG)-based RAG performs strongly on complex multi-hop tasks but suffers on fact-oriented single-hop queries. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel RAG framework: ToPG (Traversal over Proposition Graphs). ToPG models its knowledge base as a heterogeneous graph of propositions, entities, and passages, effectively combining the granular fact density of propositions with graph connectivity. We leverage this structure using iterative Suggestion-Selection cycles, where the Suggestion phase enables a query-aware traversal of the graph, and the Selection phase provides LLM feedback to prune irrelevant propositions and seed the next iteration. Evaluated on three distinct QA tasks (Simple, Complex, and Abstract QA), ToPG demonstrates strong performance across both accuracy- and quality-based metrics. Overall, ToPG shows that query-aware graph traversal combined with factual granularity is a critical component for efficient structured RAG systems. ToPG is available at https://github.com/idiap/ToPG.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 10 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

In most environments, information is distributed across isolated files like reports and logs that lack explicit links. Standard search engines process files independently, ignoring the connections between them. Furthermore, manually building Knowledge Graphs is impractical for such vast data. To bridge this gap, we present Orion-RAG. Our core insight is simple yet effective: we do not need heavy algorithms to organize this data. Instead, we use a low-complexity strategy to extract lightweight paths that naturally link related concepts. We demonstrate that this streamlined approach suffices to transform fragmented documents into semi-structured data, enabling the system to link information across different files effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Orion-RAG consistently outperforms mainstream frameworks across diverse domains, supporting real-time updates and explicit Human-in-the-Loop verification with high cost-efficiency. Experiments on FinanceBench demonstrate superior precision with a 25.2% relative improvement over strong baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[TPA: Next Token Probability Attribution for Detecting Hallucinations in RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07515v3)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation remains a challenge. Prior approaches attribute hallucinations to a binary conflict between internal knowledge stored in FFNs and the retrieved context. However, this perspective is incomplete, failing to account for the impact of other components of the LLM, such as the user query, previously generated tokens, the self token, and the final LayerNorm adjustment. To comprehensively capture the impact of these components on hallucination detection, we propose TPA which mathematically attributes each token's probability to seven distinct sources: Query, RAG Context, Past Token, Self Token, FFN, Final LayerNorm, and Initial Embedding. This attribution quantifies how each source contributes to the generation of the next token. Specifically, we aggregate these attribution scores by Part-of-Speech (POS) tags to quantify the contribution of each model component to the generation of specific linguistic categories within a response. By leveraging these patterns, such as detecting anomalies where Nouns rely heavily on LayerNorm, TPA effectively identifies hallucinated responses. Extensive experiments show that TPA achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | Under review |

Analyzing LLMs in RAG-based Question-Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06189v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is the prevailing paradigm for grounding Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the mechanisms governing how models integrate groups of conflicting retrieved evidence remain opaque. Does an LLM answer a certain way because the evidence is factually strong, because of a prior belief, or merely because it is repeated frequently? To answer this, we introduce GroupQA, a curated dataset of 1,635 controversial questions paired with 15,058 diversely-sourced evidence documents, annotated for stance and qualitative strength. Through controlled experiments, we characterize group-level evidence aggregation dynamics: Paraphrasing an argument can be more persuasive than providing distinct independent support; Models favor evidence presented first rather than last, and Larger models are increasingly resistant to adapt to presented evidence. Additionally, we find that LLM explanations to group-based answers are unfaithful. Together, we show that LLMs behave consistently as vulnerable heuristic followers, with direct implications for improving RAG system design.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, ACL ARR submission</p></details> |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a promising solution, but current methods remain inefficient and often fail to maintain high answer quality. To address these challenges, we propose VideoSpeculateRAG, an efficient VLM-based RAG framework built on two key ideas. First, we introduce a speculative decoding pipeline: a lightweight draft model quickly generates multiple answer candidates, which are then verified and refined by a more accurate heavyweight model, substantially reducing inference latency without sacrificing correctness. Second, we identify a major source of error - incorrect entity recognition in retrieved knowledge - and mitigate it with a simple yet effective similarity-based filtering strategy that improves entity alignment and boosts overall answer accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that VideoSpeculateRAG achieves comparable or higher accuracy than standard RAG approaches while accelerating inference by approximately 2x. Our framework highlights the potential of combining speculative decoding with retrieval-augmented reasoning to enhance efficiency and reliability in complex, knowledge-intensive multimodal tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging OLAP and RAG: A Multidimensional Approach to the Design of Corpus Partitioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03748v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are increasingly deployed on large-scale document collections, often comprising millions of documents and tens of millions of text chunks. In industrial-scale retrieval platforms, scalability is typically addressed through horizontal sharding and a combination of Approximate Nearest-Neighbor search, hybrid indexing, and optimized metadata filtering. Although effective from an efficiency perspective, these mechanisms rely on bottom-up, similarity-driven organization and lack a conceptual rationale for corpus partitioning. In this paper, we claim that the design of large-scale RAG systems may benefit from the combination of two orthogonal strategies: semantic clustering, which optimizes locality in embedding space, and multidimensional partitioning, which governs where retrieval should occur based on conceptual dimensions such as time and organizational context. Although such dimensions are already implicitly present in current systems, they are used in an ad hoc and poorly structured manner. We propose the Dimensional Fact Model (DFM) as a conceptual framework to guide the design of multidimensional partitions for RAG corpora. The DFM provides a principled way to reason about facts, dimensions, hierarchies, and granularity in retrieval-oriented settings. This framework naturally supports hierarchical routing and controlled fallback strategies, ensuring that retrieval remains robust even in the presence of incomplete metadata, while transforming the search process from a 'black-box' similarity matching into a governable and deterministic workflow. This work is intended as a position paper; its goal is to bridge the gap between OLAP-style multidimensional modeling and modern RAG architectures, and to stimulate further research on principled, explainable, and governable retrieval strategies at scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Routing RAG: Binding Selective Retrieval with Knowledge Verbalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01018v3)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Selective retrieval aims to make retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) more efficient and reliable by skipping retrieval when an LLM's parametric knowledge suffices. Despite promising results, existing methods are constrained by a binary design choice: either retrieve from a single external source or skip retrieval and let the LLM directly produce the final answer. We argue that this fallback underestimates the model's knowledge and obscures the more general multi-source decision problem that arises in practical systems. We propose Self-Routing RAG (SR-RAG), which casts selective retrieval as knowledge source selection and treats the LLM itself as a first-class knowledge source. SR-RAG learns to select an appropriate knowledge source, optionally verbalize parametric knowledge, and answer using the selected source, all within a single left-to-right generation pass. SR-RAG further augments source selection by combining LLM-based uncertainty with a flexible external policy datastore to improve decision calibration. Across four benchmarks and three 7B-class LLMs, SR-RAG outperforms a strong selective retrieval baseline by 8.5%/2.1%/4.7% while performing 26%/40%/21% fewer retrievals, and it achieves favorable accuracy-latency trade-offs without dataset-specific threshold tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tackling the Inherent Difficulty of Noise Filtering in RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01896v2)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a widely adopted approach to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge and reducing hallucinations. However, noisy or irrelevant documents are often introduced during RAG, potentially degrading performance and even causing hallucinated outputs. While various methods have been proposed to filter out such noise, we argue that identifying irrelevant information from retrieved content is inherently difficult and limited number of transformer layers can hardly solve this. Consequently, retrievers fail to filter out irrelevant documents entirely. Therefore, LLMs must be robust against such noise, but we demonstrate that standard fine-tuning approaches are often ineffective in enabling the model to selectively utilize relevant information while ignoring irrelevant content due to the structural constraints of attention patterns. To address this, we propose a novel fine-tuning method designed to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant information within retrieved documents. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our approach significantly improves the robustness and performance of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

This study presents an LLM-powered, agentic assessment system built on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to address these challenges. The system integrates a large language model with a structured retrieval mechanism that accesses rubric criteria, exemplar essays, and instructor feedback to generate contextually grounded grades and formative comments. A mixed-methods evaluation was conducted using 701 student essays, combining quantitative analyses of inter-rater reliability, scoring alignment, and consistency with instructor assessments, alongside qualitative evaluation of feedback quality, pedagogical relevance, and student support. Results demonstrate that the RAG system can produce reliable, rubric-aligned feedback at scale, achieving 94--99% agreement with human evaluators, while also enhancing students' opportunities for self-regulated learning and engagement with assessment criteria. The discussion highlights both pedagogical limitations, including potential constraints on originality and feedback dialogue, and the transformative potential of RAG systems to augment instructors' capabilities, streamline assessment workflows, and support scalable, adaptive learning environments. This research contributes empirical evidence for the application of agentic AI in higher education, offering a scalable and pedagogically informed model for enhancing feedback accessibility, consistency, and quality.</p></details> | 19 Pages |

We propose SRAS (Sparse Reward-Aware Selector), a lightweight document selector trained via reinforcement learning (RL) for edge-native RAG deployment. Unlike prior RL-based retrievers that assume large memory and latency budgets, SRAS learns a compact (~0.76MB) policy using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), guided by a hybrid reward signal combining Relaxed F1 and BERTScore. Our method operates under tight token and compute constraints, maintaining <1s latency on CPU. SRAS outperforms supervised and random selectors on a synthetic QA benchmark, and generalizes to real-world data, achieving BERTScore F1 of 0.8546 on SQuAD v2 without domain-specific tuning. This work is the first to demonstrate that RL-based document selection can be made ultra-lightweight, latency-aware, and effective for on-device RAG pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at ICEdge 2025; nominated for Best Paper Award</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce UniDoc-Bench, the first large-scale, realistic benchmark for MM-RAG built from $k$ real-world PDF pages across domains. Our pipeline extracts and links evidence from text, tables, and figures, then generates multimodal QA pairs spanning factual retrieval, comparison, summarization, and logical reasoning queries. To ensure reliability, all of QA pairs are validated by multiple human annotators and expert adjudication. UniDoc-Bench supports apples-to-apples comparison across four paradigms: 1) text-only, 2) image-only, 3) \emph{multimodal} text-image fusion and 4) multimodal joint retrieval -- under a unified protocol with standardized candidate pools, prompts, and evaluation metrics. UniDoc-Bench can also be used to evaluate Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. Our experiments show that multimodal text-image fusion RAG systems consistently outperform both unimodal and jointly multimodal embedding-based retrieval, indicating that neither text nor images alone are sufficient and that current multimodal embeddings remain inadequate. Beyond benchmarking, our analysis reveals when and how visual context complements textual evidence, uncovers systematic failure modes, and offers actionable guidance for developing more robust MM-RAG pipelines.</p></details> |  |

Simulating Vulnerabilities, and Threats in Multimodal Medical RAG System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17215v2)** | 2026-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) augmented with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) are increasingly employed in medical AI to enhance factual grounding through external clinical image-text retrieval. However, this reliance creates a significant attack surface. We propose MedThreatRAG, a novel multimodal poisoning framework that systematically probes vulnerabilities in medical RAG systems by injecting adversarial image-text pairs. A key innovation of our approach is the construction of a simulated semi-open attack environment, mimicking real-world medical systems that permit periodic knowledge base updates via user or pipeline contributions. Within this setting, we introduce and emphasize Cross-Modal Conflict Injection (CMCI), which embeds subtle semantic contradictions between medical images and their paired reports. These mismatches degrade retrieval and generation by disrupting cross-modal alignment while remaining sufficiently plausible to evade conventional filters. While basic textual and visual attacks are included for completeness, CMCI demonstrates the most severe degradation. Evaluations on IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR QA tasks show that MedThreatRAG reduces answer F1 scores by up to 27.66% and lowers LLaVA-Med-1.5 F1 rates to as low as 51.36%. Our findings expose fundamental security gaps in clinical RAG systems and highlight the urgent need for threat-aware design and robust multimodal consistency checks. Finally, we conclude with a concise set of guidelines to inform the safe development of future multimodal medical RAG systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sumbi...</summary><p>Sumbitted to 2026 ICASSP</p></details> |

While the former may be mitigated by RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) by anchoring answers in trusted clinical sources, there remains an open question as to whether the most effective model under this paradigm would be one that is fine-tuned on mental health data, or a more general and powerful model that succeeds purely on the basis of reasoning. In this paper, we perform a direct comparison by running four open-source models through the same RAG pipeline using ChromaDB: two generalist reasoners (Qwen2.5-3B and Phi-3-Mini) and two domain-specific fine-tunes (MentalHealthBot-7B and TherapyBot-7B). We use an LLM-as-a-Judge framework to automate evaluation over 50 turns. We find a clear trend: the generalist models outperform the domain-specific ones in empathy (3.72 vs. 3.26, $p < 0.001$) in spite of being much smaller (3B vs. 7B), and all models perform well in terms of safety, but the generalist models show better contextual understanding and are less prone to overfitting as we observe in the domain-specific models. Overall, our results indicate that for RAG-based therapy systems, strong reasoning is more important than training on mental health-specific vocabulary; i.e. a well-reasoned general model would provide more empathetic and balanced support than a larger narrowly fine-tuned model, so long as the answer is already grounded in clinical evidence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evidence-Grounded Multi-Agent Planning Support for Urban Carbon Governance via RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11587v1)** | 2026-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban carbon governance requires planners to integrate heterogeneous evidence -- emission inventories, statistical yearbooks, policy texts, technical measures, and academic findings -- into actionable, cross-departmental plans. Large Language Models (LLMs) can assist planning workflows, yet their factual reliability and evidential traceability remain critical barriers in professional use. This paper presents an evidence-grounded multi-agent planning support system for urban carbon governance built upon standard text-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) (without GraphRAG). We align the system with the typical planning workflow by decomposing tasks into four specialized agents: (i) evidence Q\&A for fact checking and compliance queries, (ii) emission status assessment for diagnostic analysis, (iii) planning recommendation for generating multi-sector governance pathways, and (iv) report integration for producing planning-style deliverables. We evaluate the system in two task families: factual retrieval and comprehensive planning generation. On factual retrieval tasks, introducing RAG increases the average score from below 6 to above 90, and dramatically improves key-field extraction (e.g., region and numeric values near 100\% detection). A real-city case study (Ningbo, China) demonstrates end-to-end report generation with strong relevance, coverage, and coherence in expert review, while also highlighting boundary inconsistencies across data sources as a practical limitation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Multi-step RAG with Hypergraph-based Memory for Long-Context Complex Relational Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23959v2)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-step retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a widely adopted strategy for enhancing large language models (LLMs) on tasks that demand global comprehension and intensive reasoning. Many RAG systems incorporate a working memory module to consolidate retrieved information. However, existing memory designs function primarily as passive storage that accumulates isolated facts for the purpose of condensing the lengthy inputs and generating new sub-queries through deduction. This static nature overlooks the crucial high-order correlations among primitive facts, the compositions of which can often provide stronger guidance for subsequent steps. Therefore, their representational strength and impact on multi-step reasoning and knowledge evolution are limited, resulting in fragmented reasoning and weak global sense-making capacity in extended contexts. We introduce HGMem, a hypergraph-based memory mechanism that extends the concept of memory beyond simple storage into a dynamic, expressive structure for complex reasoning and global understanding. In our approach, memory is represented as a hypergraph whose hyperedges correspond to distinct memory units, enabling the progressive formation of higher-order interactions within memory. This mechanism connects facts and thoughts around the focal problem, evolving into an integrated and situated knowledge structure that provides strong propositions for deeper reasoning in subsequent steps. We evaluate HGMem on several challenging datasets designed for global sense-making. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses show that our method consistently improves multi-step RAG and substantially outperforms strong baseline systems across diverse tasks.</p></details> | 21 pages |

Current biomedical question-answering systems primarily focus on short-form answers, failing to provide comprehensive explanations necessary for clinical decision-making. We present RAG-BioQA, a retrieval-augmented generation framework for long-form biomedical question answering. Our system integrates BioBERT embeddings with FAISS indexing for retrieval and a LoRA fine-tuned FLAN-T5 model for answer generation. We train on 181k QA pairs from PubMedQA, MedDialog, and MedQuAD, and evaluate on a held-out PubMedQA test set. We compare four retrieval strategies: dense retrieval (FAISS), BM25, ColBERT, and MonoT5. Our results show that domain-adapted dense retrieval outperforms zero-shot neural re-rankers, with the best configuration achieving 0.24 BLEU-1 and 0.29 ROUGE-1. Fine-tuning improves BERTScore by 81\% over the base model. We release our framework to support reproducible biomedical QA research.</p></details> | Submitted to ICAEI |

This paper presents a comparative study on the effectiveness of LLM-based techniques for detecting software vulnerabilities. The study evaluates three approaches, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and a Dual-Agent LLM framework, against a baseline LLM model. A curated dataset was compiled from Big-Vul and real-world code repositories from GitHub, focusing on five critical Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories: CWE-119, CWE-399, CWE-264, CWE-20, and CWE-200. Our RAG approach, which integrated external domain knowledge from the internet and the MITRE CWE database, achieved the highest overall accuracy (0.86) and F1 score (0.85), highlighting the value of contextual augmentation. Our SFT approach, implemented using parameter-efficient QLoRA adapters, also demonstrated strong performance. Our Dual-Agent system, an architecture in which a secondary agent audits and refines the output of the first, showed promise in improving reasoning transparency and error mitigation, with reduced resource overhead. These results emphasize that incorporating a domain expertise mechanism significantly strengthens the practical applicability of LLMs in real-world vulnerability detection tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Retrieval for RAG via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24652v2)** | 2026-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) becomes more widespread, the role of retrieval is shifting from retrieving information for human browsing to retrieving context for AI reasoning. This shift creates more complex search environments, where relevance is difficult to pre-define. Existing retrievers rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with human labels or synthetic data, resulting in static relevance that struggles to adapt to diverse RAG environments. To address this challenge, we propose R3, a Retrieval framework optimized for RAG through Reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we adopt an RL training paradigm that enables the retriever to explore and self-improve within given RAG environments, automating the learning process with minimal manual experimentation or tuning effort. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate that R3 improves RAG performance by 5.2% over the original retriever and surpasses state-of-the-art retrievers by 4.9%, while achieving comparable results to LLM-augmented retrieval and RAG systems built on post-trained or instruction-tuned LLMs. It is both efficient and practical, requiring only 4 GPUs and completing training within a single day.</p></details> |  |

We present AdaGReS, a redundancy-aware context selection framework for token-budgeted RAG that optimizes a set-level objective combining query-chunk relevance and intra-set redundancy penalties. AdaGReS performs greedy selection under a token-budget constraint using marginal gains derived from the objective, and introduces a closed-form, instance-adaptive calibration of the relevance-redundancy trade-off parameter to eliminate manual tuning and adapt to candidate-pool statistics and budget limits. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that the proposed objective exhibits epsilon-approximate submodularity under practical embedding similarity conditions, yielding near-optimality guarantees for greedy selection. Experiments on open-domain question answering (Natural Questions) and a high-redundancy biomedical (drug) corpus demonstrate consistent improvements in redundancy control and context quality, translating to better end-to-end answer quality and robustness across settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Mitigation is achieved in a question-answering Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework while detection is obtained by introducing the Negative Missing Information Scoring System (NMISS), which accounts for contextual relevance in responses. While RAG mitigates hallucinations by grounding answers in external data, NMISS refines the evaluation by identifying cases where traditional metrics incorrectly flag contextually accurate responses as hallucinations. I use Italian health news articles as context to evaluate LLM performance. Results show that Gemma2 and GPT-4 outperform the other models, with GPT-4 producing answers closely aligned with reference responses. Mid-tier models, such as Llama2, Llama3, and Mistral benefit significantly from NMISS, highlighting their ability to provide richer contextual information. This combined approach offers new insights into the reduction and more accurate assessment of hallucinations in LLMs, with applications in real-world healthcare tasks and other domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Domain Knowledge for Financial QA: A Multi-Retriever RAG Approach with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23848v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This research project addresses the errors of financial numerical reasoning Question Answering (QA) tasks due to the lack of domain knowledge in finance. Despite recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), financial numerical questions remain challenging because they require specific domain knowledge in finance and complex multi-step numeric reasoning. We implement a multi-retriever Retrieval Augmented Generators (RAG) system to retrieve both external domain knowledge and internal question contexts, and utilize the latest LLM to tackle these tasks. Through comprehensive ablation experiments and error analysis, we find that domain-specific training with the SecBERT encoder significantly contributes to our best neural symbolic model surpassing the FinQA paper's top model, which serves as our baseline. This suggests the potential superior performance of domain-specific training. Furthermore, our best prompt-based LLM generator achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with significant improvement (>7%), yet it is still below the human expert performance. This study highlights the trade-off between hallucinations loss and external knowledge gains in smaller models and few-shot examples. For larger models, the gains from external facts typically outweigh the hallucination loss. Finally, our findings confirm the enhanced numerical reasoning capabilities of the latest LLM, optimized for few-shot learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[TV-RAG: A Temporal-aware and Semantic Entropy-Weighted Framework for Long Video Retrieval and Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23483v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Video Language Models (LVLMs) have rapidly emerged as the focus of multimedia AI research. Nonetheless, when confronted with lengthy videos, these models struggle: their temporal windows are narrow, and they fail to notice fine-grained semantic shifts that unfold over extended durations. Moreover, mainstream text-based retrieval pipelines, which rely chiefly on surface-level lexical overlap, ignore the rich temporal interdependence among visual, audio, and subtitle channels. To mitigate these limitations, we propose TV-RAG, a training-free architecture that couples temporal alignment with entropy-guided semantics to improve long-video reasoning. The framework contributes two main mechanisms: \emph{(i)} a time-decay retrieval module that injects explicit temporal offsets into the similarity computation, thereby ranking text queries according to their true multimedia context; and \emph{(ii)} an entropy-weighted key-frame sampler that selects evenly spaced, information-dense frames, reducing redundancy while preserving representativeness. By weaving these temporal and semantic signals together, TV-RAG realises a dual-level reasoning routine that can be grafted onto any LVLM without re-training or fine-tuning. The resulting system offers a lightweight, budget-friendly upgrade path and consistently surpasses most leading baselines across established long-video benchmarks such as Video-MME, MLVU, and LongVideoBench, confirming the effectiveness of our model. The code can be found at https://github.com/AI-Researcher-Team/TV-RAG.</p></details> |  |

We present HiFi-RAG (Hierarchical Filtering RAG), the winning closed-source system in the Text-to-Text static evaluation of the MMU-RAGent NeurIPS 2025 Competition. Our approach moves beyond standard embedding-based retrieval via a multi-stage pipeline. We leverage the speed and cost-efficiency of Gemini 2.5 Flash (4-6x cheaper than Pro) for query formulation, hierarchical content filtering, and citation attribution, while reserving the reasoning capabilities of Gemini 2.5 Pro for final answer generation. On the MMU-RAGent validation set, our system outperformed the baseline, improving ROUGE-L to 0.274 (+19.6%) and DeBERTaScore to 0.677 (+6.2%).

We propose FVA-RAG (Falsification-Verification Alignment RAG), a pipeline that inverts the standard RAG workflow by treating the initial response as a draft hypothesis and explicitly retrieving anti-context to stress-test it. We evaluate on the full TruthfulQA-Generation benchmark (N=817) under a fully frozen protocol with 0 live web calls and identical retrieval budgets across methods. Using gpt-4o for generation and deterministic judging, FVA-RAG achieves 79.80-80.05% accuracy across two independently built frozen corpora , significantly outperforming prompted variants of Self-RAG (71.11-72.22%) and CRAG (71.36-73.93%) with p < 10^-6 according to McNemar's test. FVA-RAG triggers falsification on 24.5-29.3% of queries, demonstrating that targeted counter-evidence retrieval is decisive for mitigating premise-confirming hallucinations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Financial Sentiment Analysis for NIFTY 50 via Instruction-Tuned LLMs , RAG and Reinforcement Learning Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20082v2)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Financial sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in informing investment decisions, assessing market risk, and predicting stock price trends. Existing works in financial sentiment analysis have not considered the impact of stock prices or market feedback on sentiment analysis. In this paper, we propose an adaptive framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with real-world stock market feedback to improve sentiment classification in the context of the Indian stock market. The proposed methodology fine-tunes the LLaMA 3.2 3B model using instruction-based learning on the SentiFin dataset. To enhance sentiment predictions, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline is employed that dynamically selects multi-source contextual information based on the cosine similarity of the sentence embeddings. Furthermore, a feedback-driven module is introduced that adjusts the reliability of the source by comparing predicted sentiment with actual next-day stock returns, allowing the system to iteratively adapt to market behavior. To generalize this adaptive mechanism across temporal data, a reinforcement learning agent trained using proximal policy optimization (PPO) is incorporated. The PPO agent learns to optimize source weighting policies based on cumulative reward signals from sentiment-return alignment. Experimental results on NIFTY 50 news headlines collected from 2024 to 2025 demonstrate that the proposed system significantly improves classification accuracy, F1-score, and market alignment over baseline models and static retrieval methods. The results validate the potential of combining instruction-tuned LLMs with dynamic feedback and reinforcement learning for robust, market-aware financial sentiment modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CODS 2025</p></details> |

Despite their recent success, multimodal RAG in the audio-visual domain remains challenging due to 1) limited modality coverage and multi-hop connectivity of existing MMKGs, and 2) retrieval based solely on similarity in a shared multimodal embedding space, which fails to filter out off-topic or redundant knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose M$^3$KG-RAG, a Multi-hop Multimodal Knowledge Graph-enhanced RAG that retrieves query-aligned audio-visual knowledge from MMKGs, improving reasoning depth and answer faithfulness in MLLMs. Specifically, we devise a lightweight multi-agent pipeline to construct multi-hop MMKG (M$^3$KG), which contains context-enriched triplets of multimodal entities, enabling modality-wise retrieval based on input queries. Furthermore, we introduce GRASP (Grounded Retrieval And Selective Pruning), which ensures precise entity grounding to the query, evaluates answer-supporting relevance, and prunes redundant context to retain only knowledge essential for response generation. Extensive experiments across diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that M$^3$KG-RAG significantly enhances MLLMs' multimodal reasoning and grounding over existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

This study investigates the design and application of an AI chatbot as an educational tool in higher education. Designed to operate in the Greek language, the chatbot addresses linguistic challenges unique to Greek while delivering accurate, context grounded support aligned with the curriculum. The AI chatbot is built on the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework by grounding its responses in specific course content. RAG architecture significantly enhances the chatbots reliability by providing accurate, context-aware responses while mitigating common challenges associated with large language models (LLMs), such as hallucinations and misinformation. The AI chatbot serves a dual purpose: it enables students to access accurate, ondemand academic support and assists educators in the rapid creation of relevant educational materials. This dual functionality promotes learner autonomy and streamlines the instructional design process. The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness, reliability, and perceived usability of RAG based chatbots in higher education, exploring their potential to enhance educational practices and outcomes as well as supporting the broader adoption of AI technologies in language specific educational contexts. Findings from this research are expected to contribute to the emerging field of AI driven education by demonstrating how intelligent systems can be effectively aligned with pedagogical goals.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, 6th Barcelona Conference on Education (BCE2025)</p></details> |

However, existing methods rely on model-internal signals (e.g., logits, entropy), which are fundamentally unreliable because LLMs are typically ill-calibrated and often exhibit high confidence in erroneous outputs. We propose QuCo-RAG, which shifts from subjective confidence to objective statistics computed from pre-training data. Our method quantifies uncertainty through two stages: (1) before generation, we identify low-frequency entities indicating long-tail knowledge gaps; (2) during generation, we verify entity co-occurrence in the pre-training corpus, where zero co-occurrence often signals hallucination risk. Both stages leverage Infini-gram for millisecond-latency queries over 4 trillion tokens, triggering retrieval when uncertainty is high. Experiments on multi-hop QA benchmarks show QuCo-RAG achieves EM gains of 5--12 points over state-of-the-art baselines with OLMo-2 models, and transfers effectively to models with undisclosed pre-training data (Llama, Qwen, GPT), improving EM by up to 14 points. Domain generalization on biomedical QA further validates the robustness of our paradigm. These results establish corpus-grounded verification as a principled, practically model-agnostic paradigm for dynamic RAG.

To leverage this data, large language models (LLMs) have been introduced, offering stronger semantic understanding and reasoning than traditional deep learning, thereby enhancing the explainability of detection results. Despite the growing prominence of LLMs in this field, there is a scarcity of scholarly works that systematically synthesize how advanced enhancement techniques, specifically Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Agentic systems, can be utilized to address these reliability and reasoning limitations. Here, we systematically survey the evolving landscape of LLM-based methods for social media mental disorder analysis, spanning standard pre-trained language models, RAG to mitigate hallucinations and contextual gaps, and agentic systems for autonomous reasoning and multi-step intervention. We organize existing work by technical paradigm and clinical target, extending beyond common internalizing disorders to include psychotic disorders and externalizing behaviors. Additionally, the paper comprehensively evaluates the performance of LLMs, including the impact of RAG, across various tasks. This work establishes a unified benchmark for the field, paving the way for the development of trustworthy, autonomous AI systems that can deliver precise and explainable mental health support.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 10 figures.

Prior corrective approaches, such as Self-RAG, CRAG, and Adaptive-$k$, typically address this by \textit{adding} more context or pruning existing lists. However, simply expanding the context window often leads to \textbf{context dilution}, where distractors crowd out relevant information. We propose \textbf{SEAL-RAG}, a training-free controller that adopts a \textbf{``replace, don't expand''} strategy to fight context dilution under a fixed retrieval depth $k$. SEAL executes a (\textbf{S}earch $\rightarrow$ \textbf{E}xtract $\rightarrow$ \textbf{A}ssess $\rightarrow$ \textbf{L}oop) cycle: it performs on-the-fly, entity-anchored extraction to build a live \textit{gap specification} (missing entities/relations), triggers targeted micro-queries, and uses \textit{entity-first ranking} to actively swap out distractors for gap-closing evidence. We evaluate SEAL-RAG against faithful re-implementations of Basic RAG, CRAG, Self-RAG, and Adaptive-$k$ in a shared environment on \textbf{HotpotQA} and \textbf{2WikiMultiHopQA}. On HotpotQA ($k=3$), SEAL improves answer correctness by \textbf{+3--13 pp} and evidence precision by \textbf{+12--18 pp} over Self-RAG. On 2WikiMultiHopQA ($k=5$), it outperforms Adaptive-$k$ by \textbf{+8.0 pp} in accuracy and maintains \textbf{96\%} evidence precision compared to 22\% for CRAG. These gains are statistically significant ($p<0.001$). By enforcing fixed-$k$ replacement, SEAL yields a predictable cost profile while ensuring the top-$k$ slots are optimized for precision rather than mere breadth. We release our code and data at https://github.com/mosherino/SEAL-RAG.</p></details> | 24 pages, 2 figures |

While current detection methods leverage embedding similarity and natural language inference (NLI), their reliability in safety-critical settings remains unproven. We apply conformal prediction to RAG hallucination detection, transforming heuristic scores into decision sets with finite-sample coverage guarantees (1-alpha). Using calibration sets of n=600, we demonstrate a fundamental dichotomy: on synthetic hallucinations (Natural Questions), embedding methods achieve 95% coverage with 0% False Positive Rate (FPR). However, on real hallucinations from RLHF-aligned models (HaluEval), the same methods fail catastrophically, yielding 100% FPR at target coverage. We analyze this failure through the lens of distributional tails, showing that while NLI models achieve acceptable AUC (0.81), the "hardest" hallucinations are semantically indistinguishable from faithful responses, forcing conformal thresholds to reject nearly all valid outputs. Crucially, GPT-4 as a judge achieves 7% FPR (95% CI:[3.4%, 13.7%]) on the same data, proving the task is solvable via reasoning but opaque to surface-level semantics--a phenomenon we term the "Semantic Illusion."</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

While O-RAN enables multi-vendor interoperability and cloud-native deployments, its fast-changing specifications and interfaces pose major challenges for researchers and practitioners. Manual navigation of these complex documents is labor-intensive and error-prone, slowing system design, integration, and deployment. To address this challenge, we adopt Contextual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Contextual RAG), a strategy in which candidate answer choices guide document retrieval and chunk-specific context to improve large language model (LLM) performance. This improvement over traditional RAG achieves more targeted and context-aware retrieval, which improves the relevance of documents passed to the LLM, particularly when the query alone lacks sufficient context for accurate grounding. Our framework is designed for dynamic domains where data evolves rapidly and models must be continuously updated or redeployed, all without requiring LLM fine-tuning. We evaluate this framework using the ORANBenchmark-13K dataset, and compare three LLMs, namely, Llama3.2, Qwen2.5-7B, and Qwen3.0-4B, across both Direct Question Answering (Direct Q&A) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategies. We show that Contextual RAG consistently improves accuracy over standard RAG and base prompting, while maintaining competitive runtime and CO2 emissions. These results highlight the potential of Contextual RAG to serve as a scalable and effective solution for domain-specific Q&A in ORAN and broader 5G/6G environments, enabling more accurate interpretation of evolving standards while preserving efficiency and sustainability.</p></details> |  |

Drawing on psychological insights, we propose LUFY, a simple yet effective method that focuses on emotionally arousing memories and retains less than 10% of the conversation. In the user experiment, participants interacted with three types of RAG chatbots, each for 2 hours over 4 sessions, marking the most extensive assessment of a chatbot's long-term capabilities to date -- more than four times longer than any existing benchmark. The results demonstrate that prioritizing arousing memories while forgetting the majority of the conversation significantly enhances user experience. This study pushes the frontier of long-term conversations and highlights the importance of forgetting unimportant parts of conversations.

| **[Leveraging Spreading Activation for Improved Document Retrieval in Knowledge-Graph-Based RAG Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15922v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite initial successes and a variety of architectures, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems still struggle to reliably retrieve and connect the multi-step evidence required for complicated reasoning tasks. Most of the standard RAG frameworks regard all retrieved information as equally reliable, overlooking the varying credibility and interconnected nature of large textual corpora. GraphRAG approaches offer potential improvement to RAG systems by integrating knowledge graphs, which structure information into nodes and edges, capture entity relationships, and enable multi-step logical traversal. However, GraphRAG is not always an ideal solution as it depends on high-quality graph representations of the corpus, which requires either pre-existing knowledge graphs that are expensive to build and update, or automated graph construction pipelines that are often unreliable. Moreover, systems following this paradigm typically use large language models to guide graph traversal and evidence retrieval, leading to challenges similar to those encountered with standard RAG. In this paper, we propose a novel RAG framework that employs the spreading activation algorithm to retrieve information from a corpus of documents interconnected by automatically constructed knowledge graphs, thereby enhancing the performance of large language models on complex tasks such as multi-hop question answering. Experiments show that our method achieves better or comparable performance to iterative RAG methodologies, while also being easily integrable as a plug-and-play module with a wide range of RAG-based approaches. Combining our method with chain-of-thought iterative retrieval yields up to a 39\% absolute gain in answer correctness compared to naive RAG, achieving these results with small open-weight language models and highlighting its effectiveness in resource-constrained settings.</p></details> | 20 pages, 5 figures |

Currently, text visualizations are confined either to _flat, line-based_ decorations, which can convey only limited information about textual structure, or _nested boxes_, which convey structure but often destroy the typographic layout of the underlying text. We hypothesize that the lack of rich styling options limits the kinds of information that are displayed alongside text, wherever it may be displayed. In this paper, we show that it is possible to achieve arbitrarily nested decorations while minimally disturbing the underlying typographic layout. Specifically, we present a layout algorithm that generates _ragged blocks_, or _rocks_, which are rectilinear polygons that allow nested text to be compactly rendered even when styled with borders and padding. Our layout algorithm is evaluated on a benchmark suite comprising representative source code files in multiple programming languages. The (ragged block) layouts produced by our algorithm are substantially more compact than the (rectangular block) layouts produced by conventional techniques, when uniformly styling every element in the syntax tree with borders and padding.</p></details> | <details><summary>UIST ...</summary><p>UIST 2025 Paper + Appendices</p></details> |

This survey examines how Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are being used to make VRD retrieval practical for RAG. We organize the literature into three roles: Modality-Unifying Captioners, Multimodal Embedders, and End-to-End Representers. We compare these roles along retrieval granularity, information fidelity, latency and index size, and compatibility with reranking and grounding. We also outline key trade-offs and offer some practical guidance on when to favor each role. Finally, we identify promising directions for future research, including adaptive retrieval units, model size reduction, and the development of evaluation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages; accepted at AACL-IJCNLP 2025 (main conference)</p></details> |
| **[Cog-RAG: Cognitive-Inspired Dual-Hypergraph with Theme Alignment Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13201v2)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the response quality and domain-specific performance of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge to combat hallucinations. In recent research, graph structures have been integrated into RAG to enhance the capture of semantic relations between entities. However, it primarily focuses on low-order pairwise entity relations, limiting the high-order associations among multiple entities. Hypergraph-enhanced approaches address this limitation by modeling multi-entity interactions via hyperedges, but they are typically constrained to inter-chunk entity-level representations, overlooking the global thematic organization and alignment across chunks. Drawing inspiration from the top-down cognitive process of human reasoning, we propose a theme-aligned dual-hypergraph RAG framework (Cog-RAG) that uses a theme hypergraph to capture inter-chunk thematic structure and an entity hypergraph to model high-order semantic relations. Furthermore, we design a cognitive-inspired two-stage retrieval strategy that first activates query-relevant thematic content from the theme hypergraph, and then guides fine-grained recall and diffusion in the entity hypergraph, achieving semantic alignment and consistent generation from global themes to local details. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Cog-RAG significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art baseline approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026 main conference</p></details> |
| **[Mixture-of-RAG: Integrating Text and Tables with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09554v3)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) achieve optimal utility when their responses are grounded in external knowledge sources. However, real-world documents, such as annual reports, scientific papers, and clinical guidelines, frequently combine extensive narrative content with complex, hierarchically structured tables. While existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems effectively integrate LLMs' generative capabilities with external retrieval-based information, their performance significantly deteriorates especially processing such heterogeneous text-table hierarchies. To address this limitation, we formalize the task of Heterogeneous Document RAG, which requires joint retrieval and reasoning across textual and hierarchical tabular data. We propose MixRAG, a novel three-stage framework: (i) hierarchy row-and-column-level (H-RCL) representation that preserves hierarchical structure and heterogeneous relationship, (ii) an ensemble retriever with LLM-based reranking for evidence alignment, and (iii) multi-step reasoning decomposition via a RECAP prompt strategy. To bridge the gap in available data for this domain, we release the dataset DocRAGLib, a 2k-document corpus paired with automatically aligned text-table summaries and gold document annotations. The comprehensive experiment results demonstrate that MixRAG boosts top-1 retrieval by 46% over strong text-only, table-only, and naive-mixture baselines, establishing new state-of-the-art performance for mixed-modality document grounding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGKDD 2026</p></details> |
| **[Semantic Grounding Index: Geometric Bounds on Context Engagement in RAG Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13771v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems hallucinate, what geometric trace does this leave in embedding space? We introduce the Semantic Grounding Index (SGI), defined as the ratio of angular distances from the response to the question versus the context on the unit hypersphere $\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$.Our central finding is \emph{semantic laziness}: hallucinated responses remain angularly proximate to questions rather than departing toward retrieved contexts. On HaluEval ($n$=5,000), we observe large effect sizes (Cohen's $d$ ranging from 0.92 to 1.28) across five embedding models with mean cross-model correlation $r$=0.85. Crucially, we derive from the spherical triangle inequality that SGI's discriminative power should increase with question-context angular separation $θ(q,c)$-a theoretical prediction confirmed empirically: effect size rises monotonically from $d$=0.61 -low $θ(q,c)$, to $d$=1.27 -high $θ(q,c)$, with AUC improving from 0.72 to 0.83. Subgroup analysis reveals that SGI excels on long responses ($d$=2.05) and short questions ($d$=1.22), while remaining robust across context lengths. Calibration analysis yields ECE=0.10, indicating SGI scores can serve as probability estimates, not merely rankings. A critical negative result on TruthfulQA (AUC=0.478) establishes that angular geometry measures topical engagement rather than factual accuracy. SGI provides computationally efficient, theoretically grounded infrastructure for identifying responses that warrant verification in production RAG deployments.</p></details> |  |
| **[GRADE: Generating multi-hop QA and fine-gRAined Difficulty matrix for RAG Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16994v2)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are widely adopted in knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, but current evaluations often overlook the structural complexity and multi-step reasoning required in real-world scenarios. These benchmarks overlook key factors such as the interaction between retrieval difficulty and reasoning depth. To address this gap, we propose GRADE, a novel evaluation framework that models task difficulty along two orthogonal dimensions: (1) reasoning depth, defined by the number of inference steps (hops), and (2) semantic distance between the query and its supporting evidence. We construct a synthetic multi-hop QA dataset from factual news articles by extracting knowledge graphs and augmenting them through semantic clustering to recover missing links, allowing us to generate diverse and difficulty-controlled queries. Central to our framework is a 2D difficulty matrix that combines generator-side and retriever-side difficulty. Experiments across multiple domains and models show that error rates strongly correlate with our difficulty measures, validating their diagnostic utility. GRADE enables fine-grained analysis of RAG performance and provides a scalable foundation for evaluating and improving multi-hop reasoning in real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 findings</p></details> |
| **[Bounding Hallucinations: Information-Theoretic Guarantees for RAG Systems via Merlin-Arthur Protocols](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11614v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models rely on retrieved evidence to guide large language model (LLM) generators, yet current systems treat retrieval as a weak heuristic rather than verifiable evidence. As a result, LLMs answer without support, hallucinate under incomplete or misleading context, and rely on spurious evidence. We introduce a training framework that treats the entire RAG pipeline -- both the retriever and the generator -- as an interactive proof system via an adaptation of the Merlin-Arthur (M/A) protocol. Arthur (the generator LLM) trains on questions of unkown provenance: Merlin provides helpful evidence, while Morgana injects adversarial, misleading context. Both use a linear-time XAI method to identify and modify the evidence most influential to Arthur. Consequently, Arthur learns to (i) answer when the context support the answer, (ii) reject when evidence is insufficient, and (iii) rely on the specific context spans that truly ground the answer. We further introduce a rigorous evaluation framework to disentangle explanation fidelity from baseline predictive errors. This allows us to introduce and measure the Explained Information Fraction (EIF), which normalizes M/A certified mutual-information guarantees relative to model capacity and imperfect benchmarks. Across three RAG datasets and two model families of varying sizes, M/A-trained LLMs show improved groundedness, completeness, soundness, and reject behavior, as well as reduced hallucinations -- without needing manually annotated unanswerable questions. The retriever likewise improves recall and MRR through automatically generated M/A hard positives and negatives. Our results demonstrate that autonomous interactive-proof-style supervision provides a principled and practical path toward reliable RAG systems that treat retrieved documents not as suggestions, but as verifiable evidence.</p></details> | 34 pages, 19 figures |
| **[GFM-RAG: Graph Foundation Model for Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01113v3)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven effective in integrating knowledge into large language models (LLMs). However, conventional RAGs struggle to capture complex relationships between pieces of knowledge, limiting their performance in intricate reasoning that requires integrating knowledge from multiple sources. Recently, graph-enhanced retrieval augmented generation (GraphRAG) builds graph structure to explicitly model these relationships, enabling more effective and efficient retrievers. Nevertheless, its performance is still hindered by the noise and incompleteness within the graph structure. To address this, we introduce GFM-RAG, a novel graph foundation model (GFM) for retrieval augmented generation. GFM-RAG is powered by an innovative graph neural network that reasons over graph structure to capture complex query-knowledge relationships. The GFM with 8M parameters undergoes a two-stage training process on large-scale datasets, comprising 60 knowledge graphs with over 14M triples and 700k documents. This results in impressive performance and generalizability for GFM-RAG, making it the first graph foundation model applicable to unseen datasets for retrieval without any fine-tuning required. Extensive experiments on three multi-hop QA datasets and seven domain-specific RAG datasets demonstrate that GFM-RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining efficiency and alignment with neural scaling laws, highlighting its potential for further improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[PerCache: Predictive Hierarchical Cache for RAG Applications on Mobile Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11553v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been extensively used as a de facto paradigm in various large language model (LLM)-driven applications on mobile devices, such as mobile assistants leveraging personal emails or meeting records. However, due to the lengthy prompts and the resource constraints, mobile RAG systems exhibit significantly high response latency. On this issue, one promising approach is to reuse intermediate computational results across different queries to eliminate redundant computation. But most existing approaches, such as KV cache reuse and semantic cache reuse, are designed for cloud settings and perform poorly, overlooking the distinctive characteristics of mobile RAG. We propose PerCache, a novel hierarchical cache solution designed for reducing end-to-end latency of personalized RAG applications on mobile platforms. PerCache adopts a hierarchical architecture that progressively matches similar queries and QKV cache to maximize the reuse of intermediate results at different computing stages. To improve cache hit rate, PerCache applies a predictive method to populate cache with queries that are likely to be raised in the future. In addition, PerCache can adapt its configurations to dynamic system loads, aiming at maximizing the caching utility with minimal resource consumption. We implement PerCache on top of an existing mobile LLM inference engine with commodity mobile phones. Extensive evaluations show that PerCache can surpass the best-performing baseline by 34.4% latency reduction across various applications and maintain optimal latency performance under dynamic resource changes.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods for generating such analyzes require significant financial expertise and are often time-consuming. With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), domain-specific adaptations have emerged for financial tasks such as sentiment analysis and entity recognition. This paper introduces RAG-IT (Retrieval-Augmented Instruction Tuning), a novel framework designed to automate the generation of earnings report analysis through an LLM fine-tuned specifically for the financial domain. Our approach integrates retrieval augmentation with instruction-based fine-tuning to enhance factual accuracy, contextual relevance, and domain adaptability. We construct a sector-specific financial instruction dataset derived from semiconductor industry documents to guide the LLM adaptation to specialized financial reasoning. Using NVIDIA, AMD, and Broadcom as representative companies, our case study demonstrates that RAG-IT substantially improves a general-purpose open-source LLM and achieves performance comparable to commercial systems like GPT-3.5 on financial report generation tasks. This research highlights the potential of retrieval-augmented instruction tuning to streamline and elevate financial analysis automation, advancing the broader field of intelligent financial reporting.</p></details> | <details><summary>We up...</summary><p>We updated title, abstract and added more details in experiment section.

| **[Improving LLM Reliability with RAG in Religious Question-Answering: MufassirQAS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15378v6)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Religious teachings can sometimes be complex and challenging to grasp, but chatbots can serve as effective assistants in this domain. Large Language Model (LLM) based chatbots, powered by Natural Language Processing (NLP), can connect related topics and provide well-supported responses to intricate questions, making them valuable tools for religious education. However, LLMs are prone to hallucinations as they can generate inaccurate or irrelevant information, and these can include sensitive content that could be offensive, inappropriate, or controversial. Addressing such topics without inadvertently promoting hate speech or disrespecting certain beliefs remains a significant challenge. As a solution to these issues, we introduce MufassirQAS, a system that enhances LLM accuracy and transparency using a vector database-driven Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. We built a dataset comprising fundamental books containing Turkish translations and interpretations of Islamic texts. This database is leveraged to answer religious inquiries while ensuring that responses remain reliable and contextually grounded. Our system also presents the relevant dataset sections alongside the LLM-generated answers, reinforcing transparency. We carefully designed system prompts to prevent harmful, offensive, or disrespectful outputs, ensuring that responses align with ethical and respectful discourse. Moreover, MufassirQAS provides supplementary details, such as source page numbers and referenced articles, to enhance credibility. To evaluate its effectiveness, we tested MufassirQAS against ChatGPT with sensitive questions, and our system demonstrated superior performance in maintaining accuracy and reliability. Future work will focus on improving accuracy and refining prompt engineering techniques to further minimize biases and ensure even more reliable responses.</p></details> |  |
