| **[V2Flow: Unifying Visual Tokenization and Large Language Model Vocabularies for Autoregressive Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07493v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose V2Flow, a novel tokenizer that produces discrete visual tokens capable of high-fidelity reconstruction, while ensuring structural and latent distribution alignment with the vocabulary space of large language models (LLMs). Leveraging this tight visual-vocabulary coupling, V2Flow enables autoregressive visual generation on top of existing LLMs. Our approach formulates visual tokenization as a flow-matching problem, aiming to learn a mapping from a standard normal prior to the continuous image distribution, conditioned on token sequences embedded within the LLMs vocabulary space. The effectiveness of V2Flow stems from two core designs. First, we propose a Visual Vocabulary resampler, which compresses visual data into compact token sequences, with each represented as a soft categorical distribution over LLM's vocabulary. This allows seamless integration of visual tokens into existing LLMs for autoregressive visual generation. Second, we present a masked autoregressive Rectified-Flow decoder, employing a masked transformer encoder-decoder to refine visual tokens into contextually enriched embeddings. These embeddings then condition a dedicated velocity field for precise reconstruction. Additionally, an autoregressive rectified-flow sampling strategy is incorporated, ensuring flexible sequence lengths while preserving competitive reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments show that V2Flow outperforms mainstream VQ-based tokenizers and facilitates autoregressive visual generation on top of existing. https://github.com/zhangguiwei610/V2Flow</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

However, MLLMs usually perform poorly in zero-shot medical disease recognition, as they do not fully exploit the captured features and available medical knowledge. To address this challenge, we propose LLaVA-RadZ, a simple yet effective framework for zero-shot medical disease recognition. Specifically, we design an end-to-end training strategy, termed Decoding-Side Feature Alignment Training (DFAT) to take advantage of the characteristics of the MLLM decoder architecture and incorporate modality-specific tokens tailored for different modalities, which effectively utilizes image and text representations and facilitates robust cross-modal alignment. Additionally, we introduce a Domain Knowledge Anchoring Module (DKAM) to exploit the intrinsic medical knowledge of large models, which mitigates the category semantic gap in image-text alignment. DKAM improves category-level alignment, allowing for accurate disease recognition. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our LLaVA-RadZ significantly outperforms traditional MLLMs in zero-shot disease recognition and exhibits the state-of-the-art performance compared to the well-established and highly-optimized CLIP-based approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[GenAIReading: Augmenting Human Cognition with Interactive Digital Textbooks Using Large Language Models and Image Generation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07463v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cognitive augmentation is a cornerstone in advancing education, particularly through personalized learning. However, personalizing extensive textual materials, such as narratives and academic textbooks, remains challenging due to their heavy use, which can hinder learner engagement and understanding. Building on cognitive theories like Dual Coding Theory -- which posits that combining textual and visual information enhances comprehension and memory -- this study explores the potential of Generative AI (GenAI) to enrich educational materials. We utilized large language models (LLMs) to generate concise text summaries and image generation models (IGMs) to create visually aligned content from textual inputs. After recruiting 24 participants, we verified that integrating AI-generated supplementary materials significantly improved learning outcomes, increasing post-reading test scores by 7.50%. These findings underscore GenAI's transformative potential in creating adaptive learning environments that enhance cognitive augmentation.</p></details> | Accepted at AHs2025 |
| **[MedAgentsBench: Benchmarking Thinking Models and Agent Frameworks for Complex Medical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07459v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on existing medical question-answering benchmarks. This high performance makes it increasingly difficult to meaningfully evaluate and differentiate advanced methods. We present MedAgentsBench, a benchmark that focuses on challenging medical questions requiring multi-step clinical reasoning, diagnosis formulation, and treatment planning-scenarios where current models still struggle despite their strong performance on standard tests. Drawing from seven established medical datasets, our benchmark addresses three key limitations in existing evaluations: (1) the prevalence of straightforward questions where even base models achieve high performance, (2) inconsistent sampling and evaluation protocols across studies, and (3) lack of systematic analysis of the interplay between performance, cost, and inference time. Through experiments with various base models and reasoning methods, we demonstrate that the latest thinking models, DeepSeek R1 and OpenAI o3, exhibit exceptional performance in complex medical reasoning tasks. Additionally, advanced search-based agent methods offer promising performance-to-cost ratios compared to traditional approaches. Our analysis reveals substantial performance gaps between model families on complex questions and identifies optimal model selections for different computational constraints. Our benchmark and evaluation framework are publicly available at https://github.com/gersteinlab/medagents-benchmark.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we study empirically whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit the same behavior of conversational adaptation. We construct a corpus of conversations between LLMs and find that two LLM agents end up making more similar syntactic choices as conversations go on, confirming that modern LLMs adapt their language use to their conversational partners in at least a rudimentary way.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 1 table, 1 figure, submitted to ACL</p></details> |

In this study, opinions from 11 experts regarding their experience with LLMs for software development have been gathered and analysed to draw insights that can guide successful and responsible integration. The overall opinion of the experts is positive, with the experts identifying advantages such as increase in productivity and reduced coding time. Potential concerns and challenges such as risk of over-dependence and ethical considerations have also been highlighted.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The project is partially supported by the DkIT Postgraduate Scholarship, Research Ireland under Grant number 13/RC/2094_2, and Grant number 21/FFP-A/925</p></details> |

While prior work has focused on generating math problems and high-quality distractors, the role of visualization in math learning remains under-explored. Diagrams are essential for mathematical thinking and problem-solving, yet manually creating them is time-consuming and requires domain-specific expertise, limiting scalability. Recent research on using LLMs to generate Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) presents a promising approach to automating diagram creation. Unlike pixel-based images, SVGs represent geometric figures using XML, allowing seamless scaling and adaptability. Educational platforms such as Khan Academy and IXL already use SVGs to display math problems and hints. In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs to generate math-related diagrams that accompany textual hints via intermediate SVG representations. We address three research questions: (1) how to automatically generate math diagrams in problem-solving hints and evaluate their quality, (2) whether SVG is an effective intermediate representation for math diagrams, and (3) what prompting strategies and formats are required for LLMs to generate accurate SVG-based diagrams. Our contributions include defining the task of automatically generating SVG-based diagrams for math hints, developing an LLM prompting-based pipeline, and identifying key strategies for improving diagram generation. Additionally, we introduce a Visual Question Answering-based evaluation setup and conduct ablation studies to assess different pipeline variations. By automating the math diagram creation, we aim to provide students and teachers with accurate, conceptually relevant visual aids that enhance problem-solving and learning experiences.</p></details> |  |
| **[RePO: ReLU-based Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07426v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is critical for real-world deployment, yet existing methods like RLHF face computational and stability challenges. While DPO establishes an offline paradigm with single hyperparameter $\beta$, subsequent methods like SimPO reintroduce complexity through dual parameters ($\beta$, $\gamma$). We propose {ReLU-based Preference Optimization (RePO)}, a streamlined algorithm that eliminates $\beta$ via two advances: (1) retaining SimPO's reference-free margins but removing $\beta$ through gradient analysis, and (2) adopting a ReLU-based max-margin loss that naturally filters trivial pairs. Theoretically, RePO is characterized as SimPO's limiting case ($\beta \to \infty$), where the logistic weighting collapses to binary thresholding, forming a convex envelope of the 0-1 loss. Empirical results on AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard show that RePO outperforms DPO and SimPO across multiple base models, requiring only one hyperparameter to tune.</p></details> |  |
| **[REF-VLM: Triplet-Based Referring Paradigm for Unified Visual Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07413v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate robust zero-shot capabilities across diverse vision-language tasks after training on mega-scale datasets. However, dense prediction tasks, such as semantic segmentation and keypoint detection, pose significant challenges for MLLMs when represented solely as text outputs. Simultaneously, current MLLMs utilizing latent embeddings for visual task decoding generally demonstrate limited adaptability to both multi-task learning and multi-granularity scenarios. In this work, we present REF-VLM, an end-to-end framework for unified training of various visual decoding tasks. To address complex visual decoding scenarios, we introduce the Triplet-Based Referring Paradigm (TRP), which explicitly decouples three critical dimensions in visual decoding tasks through a triplet structure: concepts, decoding types, and targets. TRP employs symbolic delimiters to enforce structured representation learning, enhancing the parsability and interpretability of model outputs. Additionally, we construct Visual-Task Instruction Following Dataset (VTInstruct), a large-scale multi-task dataset containing over 100 million multimodal dialogue samples across 25 task types. Beyond text inputs and outputs, VT-Instruct incorporates various visual prompts such as point, box, scribble, and mask, and generates outputs composed of text and visual units like box, keypoint, depth and mask. The combination of different visual prompts and visual units generates a wide variety of task types, expanding the applicability of REF-VLM significantly. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our REF-VLM outperforms other MLLMs across a variety of standard benchmarks.

| **[Revisiting Noise in Natural Language Processing for Computational Social Science](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07395v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational Social Science (CSS) is an emerging field driven by the unprecedented availability of human-generated content for researchers. This field, however, presents a unique set of challenges due to the nature of the theories and datasets it explores, including highly subjective tasks and complex, unstructured textual corpora. Among these challenges, one of the less well-studied topics is the pervasive presence of noise. This thesis aims to address this gap in the literature by presenting a series of interconnected case studies that examine different manifestations of noise in CSS. These include character-level errors following the OCR processing of historical records, archaic language, inconsistencies in annotations for subjective and ambiguous tasks, and even noise and biases introduced by large language models during content generation. This thesis challenges the conventional notion that noise in CSS is inherently harmful or useless. Rather, it argues that certain forms of noise can encode meaningful information that is invaluable for advancing CSS research, such as the unique communication styles of individuals or the culture-dependent nature of datasets and tasks. Further, this thesis highlights the importance of nuance in dealing with noise and the considerations CSS researchers must address when encountering it, demonstrating that different types of noise require distinct strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD t...</summary><p>PhD thesis.

| **[Process-Supervised LLM Recommenders via Flow-guided Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07377v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adapted for recommendation systems via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), this approach amplifies popularity bias due to its likelihood maximization objective, compromising recommendation diversity and fairness. To address this, we present Flow-guided fine-tuning recommender (Flower), which replaces SFT with a Generative Flow Network (GFlowNet) framework that enacts process supervision through token-level reward propagation. Flower's key innovation lies in decomposing item-level rewards into constituent token rewards, enabling direct alignment between token generation probabilities and their reward signals. This mechanism achieves three critical advancements: (1) popularity bias mitigation and fairness enhancement through empirical distribution matching, (2) preservation of diversity through GFlowNet's proportional sampling, and (3) flexible integration of personalized preferences via adaptable token rewards. Experiments demonstrate Flower's superior distribution-fitting capability and its significant advantages over traditional SFT in terms of fairness, diversity, and accuracy, highlighting its potential to improve LLM-based recommendation systems. The implementation is available via https://github.com/Mr-Peach0301/Flower</p></details> |  |
| **[Every FLOP Counts: Scaling a 300B Mixture-of-Experts LING LLM without Premium GPUs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05139v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this technical report, we tackle the challenges of training large-scale Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, focusing on overcoming cost inefficiency and resource limitations prevalent in such systems. To address these issues, we present two differently sized MoE large language models (LLMs), namely Ling-Lite and Ling-Plus (referred to as "Bailing" in Chinese, spelled B\v{a}il\'ing in Pinyin). Ling-Lite contains 16.8 billion parameters with 2.75 billion activated parameters, while Ling-Plus boasts 290 billion parameters with 28.8 billion activated parameters. Both models exhibit comparable performance to leading industry benchmarks. This report offers actionable insights to improve the efficiency and accessibility of AI development in resource-constrained settings, promoting more scalable and sustainable technologies. Specifically, to reduce training costs for large-scale MoE models, we propose innovative methods for (1) optimization of model architecture and training processes, (2) refinement of training anomaly handling, and (3) enhancement of model evaluation efficiency. Additionally, leveraging high-quality data generated from knowledge graphs, our models demonstrate superior capabilities in tool use compared to other models. Ultimately, our experimental findings demonstrate that a 300B MoE LLM can be effectively trained on lower-performance devices while achieving comparable performance to models of a similar scale, including dense and MoE models. Compared to high-performance devices, utilizing a lower-specification hardware system during the pre-training phase demonstrates significant cost savings, reducing computing costs by approximately 20%.

| **[Artificial Utopia: Simulation and Intelligent Agents for a Democratised Future](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07364v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prevailing top-down systems in politics and economics struggle to keep pace with the pressing challenges of the 21st century, such as climate change, social inequality and conflict. Bottom-up democratisation and participatory approaches in politics and economics are increasingly seen as promising alternatives to confront and overcome these issues, often with utopian overtones, as proponents believe they may dramatically reshape political, social and ecological futures for the better and in contrast to contemporary authoritarian tendencies across various countries. Institutional specifics and the associated collective human behavior or culture remains little understood and debated, however. In this article, I propose a novel research agenda focusing on utopian democratisation efforts with formal and computational methods as well as with artificial intelligence - I call this agenda Artificial Utopia. Artificial Utopias provide safe testing grounds for new political ideas and economic policies in-silico with reduced risk of negative consequences as compared to testing ideas in real-world contexts. An increasing number of advanced simulation and intelligence methods, that aim at representing human cognition and collective decision-making in more realistic ways, could benefit this process. This includes agent-based modelling, reinforcement learning, large language models and more. I clarify what some of these simulation approaches can contribute to the study of Artificial Utopias with the help of two institutional examples: the citizen assembly and the democratic firm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Large Language Models to Address Data Scarcity in Machine Learning: Applications in Graphene Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04870v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning in materials science faces challenges due to limited experimental data, as generating synthesis data is costly and time-consuming, especially with in-house experiments. Mining data from existing literature introduces issues like mixed data quality, inconsistent formats, and variations in reporting experimental parameters, complicating the creation of consistent features for the learning algorithm. Additionally, combining continuous and discrete features can hinder the learning process with limited data. Here, we propose strategies that utilize large language models (LLMs) to enhance machine learning performance on a limited, heterogeneous dataset of graphene chemical vapor deposition synthesis compiled from existing literature. These strategies include prompting modalities for imputing missing data points and leveraging large language model embeddings to encode the complex nomenclature of substrates reported in chemical vapor deposition experiments. The proposed strategies enhance graphene layer classification using a support vector machine (SVM) model, increasing binary classification accuracy from 39% to 65% and ternary accuracy from 52% to 72%. We compare the performance of the SVM and a GPT-4 model, both trained and fine-tuned on the same data. Our results demonstrate that the numerical classifier, when combined with LLM-driven data enhancements, outperforms the standalone LLM predictor, highlighting that in data-scarce scenarios, improving predictive learning with LLM strategies requires more than simple fine-tuning on datasets. Instead, it necessitates sophisticated approaches for data imputation and feature space homogenization to achieve optimal performance. The proposed strategies emphasize data enhancement techniques, offering a broadly applicable framework for improving machine learning performance on scarce, inhomogeneous datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables; Supplementary Material with 13 figures and 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Towards Fully-Automated Materials Discovery via Large-Scale Synthesis Dataset and Expert-Level LLM-as-a-Judge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16457v3)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Materials synthesis is vital for innovations such as energy storage, catalysis, electronics, and biomedical devices. Yet, the process relies heavily on empirical, trial-and-error methods guided by expert intuition. Our work aims to support the materials science community by providing a practical, data-driven resource. We have curated a comprehensive dataset of 17K expert-verified synthesis recipes from open-access literature, which forms the basis of our newly developed benchmark, AlchemyBench. AlchemyBench offers an end-to-end framework that supports research in large language models applied to synthesis prediction. It encompasses key tasks, including raw materials and equipment prediction, synthesis procedure generation, and characterization outcome forecasting. We propose an LLM-as-a-Judge framework that leverages large language models for automated evaluation, demonstrating strong statistical agreement with expert assessments. Overall, our contributions offer a supportive foundation for exploring the capabilities of LLMs in predicting and guiding materials synthesis, ultimately paving the way for more efficient experimental design and accelerated innovation in materials science.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Calling a Spade a Heart: Gaslighting Multimodal Large Language Models via Negation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19017v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited remarkable advancements in integrating different modalities, excelling in complex understanding and generation tasks. Despite their success, MLLMs remain vulnerable to conversational adversarial inputs, particularly negation arguments. This paper systematically evaluates state-of-the-art MLLMs across diverse benchmarks, revealing significant performance drops when negation arguments are introduced to initially correct responses. Notably, we introduce the first benchmark GaslightingBench, specifically designed to evaluate the vulnerability of MLLMs to negation arguments. GaslightingBench consists of multiple-choice questions curated from existing datasets, along with generated negation prompts across 20 diverse categories. Throughout extensive evaluation, we find that proprietary models such as Gemini-1.5-flash, GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet demonstrate better resilience compared to open-source counterparts like Qwen2-VL and LLaVA. However, all evaluated MLLMs struggle to maintain logical consistency under negation arguments during conversation. Our findings provide critical insights for improving the robustness of MLLMs against negation inputs, contributing to the development of more reliable and trustworthy multimodal AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unleashing the Potential of Large Language Models for Text-to-Image Generation through Autoregressive Representation Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07334v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Autoregressive Representation Alignment (ARRA), a new training framework that unlocks global-coherent text-to-image generation in autoregressive LLMs without architectural changes. Unlike prior work that requires complex architectural redesigns, ARRA aligns LLM hidden states with visual representations from external visual foundational models via a global visual alignment loss and a hybrid token, <HYBNEXT>. This token enforces dual constraints: local next-token prediction and global semantic distillation, enabling LLMs to implicitly learn spatial and contextual coherence while retaining their original autoregressive paradigm. Extensive experiments validate ARRA's plug-and-play versatility. When training from text-generation-only LLMs or random initialization, ARRA reduces FID by 25.5% (MIMIC-CXR), 8.8% (DeepEyeNet), and 7.5% (ImageNet) for advanced autoregressive LLMs like Chameleon and LlamaGen, all without framework modifications. For domain adaption, ARRA aligns general-purpose LLMs with specialized models (e.g., BioMedCLIP), achieving an 18.6% FID reduction over direct fine-tuning on medical imaging (MIMIC-CXR). By demonstrating that training objective redesign -- not just architectural innovation -- can resolve cross-modal global coherence challenges, ARRA offers a complementary paradigm for advancing autoregressive models. Code and models will be released to advance autoregressive image generation.</p></details> |  |

We analyze the macro-level impact through traditional metrics like accuracy and F1, calculating their mean and variance to quantify performance fluctuations. To capture the micro-level effects, we introduce a novel metric, consistency, measuring the stability of individual predictions across runs. Our experiments reveal significant variance at both macro and micro levels, underscoring the need for careful consideration of random seeds in fine-tuning and evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 tables, 3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic Path Navigation for Motion Agents with LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07323v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generalizable reasoning and planning capabilities. However, their efficacies in spatial path planning and obstacle-free trajectory generation remain underexplored. Leveraging LLMs for navigation holds significant potential, given LLMs' ability to handle unseen scenarios, support user-agent interactions, and provide global control across complex systems, making them well-suited for agentic planning and humanoid motion generation. As one of the first studies in this domain, we explore the zero-shot navigation and path generation capabilities of LLMs by constructing a dataset and proposing an evaluation protocol. Specifically, we represent paths using anchor points connected by straight lines, enabling movement in various directions. This approach offers greater flexibility and practicality compared to previous methods while remaining simple and intuitive for LLMs. We demonstrate that, when tasks are well-structured in this manner, modern LLMs exhibit substantial planning proficiency in avoiding obstacles while autonomously refining navigation with the generated motion to reach the target. Further, this spatial reasoning ability of a single LLM motion agent interacting in a static environment can be seamlessly generalized in multi-motion agents coordination in dynamic environments. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on single-step planning or local policies, our training-free LLM-based method enables global, dynamic, closed-loop planning, and autonomously resolving collision issues.</p></details> |  |
| **[Experimental Exploration: Investigating Cooperative Interaction Behavior Between Humans and Large Language Model Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07320v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of large language models (LLMs), AI agents as autonomous decision-makers present significant opportunities and challenges for human-AI cooperation. While many studies have explored human cooperation with AI as tools, the role of LLM-augmented autonomous agents in competitive-cooperative interactions remains under-examined. This study investigates human cooperative behavior by engaging 30 participants who interacted with LLM agents exhibiting different characteristics (purported human, purported rule-based AI agent, and LLM agent) in repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games. Findings show significant differences in cooperative behavior based on the agents' purported characteristics and the interaction effect of participants' genders and purported characteristics. We also analyzed human response patterns, including game completion time, proactive favorable behavior, and acceptance of repair efforts. These insights offer a new perspective on human interactions with LLM agents in competitive cooperation contexts, such as virtual avatars or future physical entities. The study underscores the importance of understanding human biases toward AI agents and how observed behaviors can influence future human-AI cooperation dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Corrective Task Planning by Inverse Prompting with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07317v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In robot task planning, large language models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in generating complex and long-horizon action sequences. However, it is observed that LLMs often produce responses that sound plausible but are not accurate. To address these problems, existing methods typically employ predefined error sets or external knowledge sources, requiring human efforts and computation resources. Recently, self-correction approaches have emerged, where LLM generates and refines plans, identifying errors by itself. Despite their effectiveness, they are more prone to failures in correction due to insufficient reasoning. In this paper, we introduce InversePrompt, a novel self-corrective task planning approach that leverages inverse prompting to enhance interpretability. Our method incorporates reasoning steps to provide clear, interpretable feedback. It generates inverse actions corresponding to the initially generated actions and verifies whether these inverse actions can restore the system to its original state, explicitly validating the logical coherence of the generated plans.The results on benchmark datasets show an average 16.3% higher success rate over existing LLM-based task planning methods. Our approach offers clearer justifications for feedback in real-world environments, resulting in more successful task completion than existing self-correction approaches across various scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Benchmarking Chinese Medical LLMs: A Medbench-based Analysis of Performance Gaps and Hierarchical Optimization Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07306v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evaluation and improvement of medical large language models (LLMs) are critical for their real-world deployment, particularly in ensuring accuracy, safety, and ethical alignment. Existing frameworks inadequately dissect domain-specific error patterns or address cross-modal challenges. This study introduces a granular error taxonomy through systematic analysis of top 10 models on MedBench, categorizing incorrect responses into eight types: Omissions, Hallucination, Format Mismatch, Causal Reasoning Deficiency, Contextual Inconsistency, Unanswered, Output Error, and Deficiency in Medical Language Generation. Evaluation of 10 leading models reveals vulnerabilities: despite achieving 0.86 accuracy in medical knowledge recall, critical reasoning tasks show 96.3% omission, while safety ethics evaluations expose alarming inconsistency (robustness score: 0.79) under option shuffled. Our analysis uncovers systemic weaknesses in knowledge boundary enforcement and multi-step reasoning. To address these, we propose a tiered optimization strategy spanning four levels, from prompt engineering and knowledge-augmented retrieval to hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures and causal reasoning frameworks. This work establishes an actionable roadmap for developing clinically robust LLMs while redefining evaluation paradigms through error-driven insights, ultimately advancing the safety and trustworthiness of AI in high-stakes medical environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[The amplifier effect of artificial agents in social contagion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21037v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in artificial intelligence have led to the proliferation of artificial agents in social contexts, ranging from education to online social media and financial markets, among many others. The increasing rate at which artificial and human agents interact makes it urgent to understand the consequences of human-machine interactions for the propagation of new ideas, products, and behaviors in society. Across two distinct empirical contexts, we find here that artificial agents lead to significantly faster and wider social contagion. To this end, we replicate a choice experiment previously conducted with human subjects by using artificial agents powered by large language models (LLMs). We use the experiment's results to measure the adoption thresholds of artificial agents and their impact on the spread of social contagion. We find that artificial agents tend to exhibit lower adoption thresholds than humans, which leads to wider network-based social contagions. Our findings suggest that the increased presence of artificial agents in real-world networks may accelerate behavioral shifts, potentially in unforeseen ways.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main text pp. 1-4; Supplementary Material pp. 5-10</p></details> |
| **[A Graph-based Verification Framework for Fact-Checking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07282v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fact-checking plays a crucial role in combating misinformation. Existing methods using large language models (LLMs) for claim decomposition face two key limitations: (1) insufficient decomposition, introducing unnecessary complexity to the verification process, and (2) ambiguity of mentions, leading to incorrect verification results. To address these challenges, we suggest introducing a claim graph consisting of triplets to address the insufficient decomposition problem and reduce mention ambiguity through graph structure. Based on this core idea, we propose a graph-based framework, GraphFC, for fact-checking. The framework features three key components: graph construction, which builds both claim and evidence graphs; graph-guided planning, which prioritizes the triplet verification order; and graph-guided checking, which verifies the triples one by one between claim and evidence graphs. Extensive experiments show that GraphFC enables fine-grained decomposition while resolving referential ambiguities through relational constraints, achieving state-of-the-art performance across three datasets.</p></details> | 13pages, 4figures |
| **[ToolFuzz -- Automated Agent Tool Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04479v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) Agents leverage the advanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs in real-world applications. To interface with an environment, these agents often rely on tools, such as web search or database APIs. As the agent provides the LLM with tool documentation along the user query, the completeness and correctness of this documentation is critical. However, tool documentation is often over-, under-, or ill-specified, impeding the agent's accuracy. Standard software testing approaches struggle to identify these errors as they are expressed in natural language. Thus, despite its importance, there currently exists no automated method to test the tool documentation for agents. To address this issue, we present ToolFuzz, the first method for automated testing of tool documentations. ToolFuzz is designed to discover two types of errors: (1) user queries leading to tool runtime errors and (2) user queries that lead to incorrect agent responses. ToolFuzz can generate a large and diverse set of natural inputs, effectively finding tool description errors at a low false positive rate. Further, we present two straightforward prompt-engineering approaches. We evaluate all three tool testing approaches on 32 common LangChain tools and 35 newly created custom tools and 2 novel benchmarks to further strengthen the assessment. We find that many publicly available tools suffer from underspecification. Specifically, we show that ToolFuzz identifies 20x more erroneous inputs compared to the prompt-engineering approaches, making it a key component for building reliable AI agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mapping AI Benchmark Data to Quantitative Risk Estimates Through Expert Elicitation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04299v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The literature and multiple experts point to many potential risks from large language models (LLMs), but there are still very few direct measurements of the actual harms posed. AI risk assessment has so far focused on measuring the models' capabilities, but the capabilities of models are only indicators of risk, not measures of risk. Better modeling and quantification of AI risk scenarios can help bridge this disconnect and link the capabilities of LLMs to tangible real-world harm. This paper makes an early contribution to this field by demonstrating how existing AI benchmarks can be used to facilitate the creation of risk estimates. We describe the results of a pilot study in which experts use information from Cybench, an AI benchmark, to generate probability estimates. We show that the methodology seems promising for this purpose, while noting improvements that can be made to further strengthen its application in quantitative AI risk assessment.</p></details> | 23 pages, 4 figures |

This study proposes CoT-Drive, a novel approach that enhances motion forecasting by leveraging large language models (LLMs) and a chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting method. We introduce a teacher-student knowledge distillation strategy to effectively transfer LLMs' advanced scene understanding capabilities to lightweight language models (LMs), ensuring that CoT-Drive operates in real-time on edge devices while maintaining comprehensive scene understanding and generalization capabilities. By leveraging CoT prompting techniques for LLMs without additional training, CoT-Drive generates semantic annotations that significantly improve the understanding of complex traffic environments, thereby boosting the accuracy and robustness of predictions. Additionally, we present two new scene description datasets, Highway-Text and Urban-Text, designed for fine-tuning lightweight LMs to generate context-specific semantic annotations. Comprehensive evaluations of five real-world datasets demonstrate that CoT-Drive outperforms existing models, highlighting its effectiveness and efficiency in handling complex traffic scenarios. Overall, this study is the first to consider the practical application of LLMs in this field. It pioneers the training and use of a lightweight LLM surrogate for motion forecasting, setting a new benchmark and showcasing the potential of integrating LLMs into AD systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[SafeAgentBench: A Benchmark for Safe Task Planning of Embodied LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13178v4)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the integration of large language models (LLMs), embodied agents have strong capabilities to understand and plan complicated natural language instructions. However, a foreseeable issue is that those embodied agents can also flawlessly execute some hazardous tasks, potentially causing damages in the real world. Existing benchmarks predominantly overlook critical safety risks, focusing solely on planning performance, while a few evaluate LLMs' safety awareness only on non-interactive image-text data. To address this gap, we present SafeAgentBench-the first benchmark for safety-aware task planning of embodied LLM agents in interactive simulation environments. SafeAgentBench includes: (1) an executable, diverse, and high-quality dataset of 750 tasks, rigorously curated to cover 10 potential hazards and 3 task types; (2) SafeAgentEnv, a universal embodied environment with a low-level controller, supporting multi-agent execution with 17 high-level actions for 8 state-of-the-art baselines; and (3) reliable evaluation methods from both execution and semantic perspectives. Experimental results show that, although agents based on different design frameworks exhibit substantial differences in task success rates, their overall safety awareness remains weak. The most safety-conscious baseline achieves only a 10\% rejection rate for detailed hazardous tasks. Moreover, simply replacing the LLM driving the agent does not lead to notable improvements in safety awareness.

However, the specialized nature of biochemical data often necessitates costly domain-specific fine-tuning, posing critical challenges. First, it hinders the application of more flexible general-purpose LLMs in cutting-edge drug discovery tasks. More importantly, it impedes the rapid integration of the vast amounts of scientific data continuously generated through experiments and research. To investigate these challenges, we propose CLADD, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-empowered agentic system tailored to drug discovery tasks. Through the collaboration of multiple LLM agents, CLADD dynamically retrieves information from biomedical knowledge bases, contextualizes query molecules, and integrates relevant evidence to generate responses -- all without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. Crucially, we tackle key obstacles in applying RAG workflows to biochemical data, including data heterogeneity, ambiguity, and multi-source integration. We demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of this framework across a variety of drug discovery tasks, showing that it outperforms general-purpose and domain-specific LLMs as well as traditional deep learning approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Machi...</summary><p>Machine Learning, Drug Discovery</p></details> |
| **[LossAgent: Towards Any Optimization Objectives for Image Processing with LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04090v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the first loss agent, dubbed LossAgent, for low-level image processing tasks, e.g., image super-resolution and restoration, intending to achieve any customized optimization objectives of low-level image processing in different practical applications. Notably, not all optimization objectives, such as complex hand-crafted perceptual metrics, text description, and intricate human feedback, can be instantiated with existing low-level losses, e.g., MSE loss, which presents a crucial challenge in optimizing image processing networks in an end-to-end manner. To eliminate this, our LossAgent introduces the powerful large language model (LLM) as the loss agent, where the rich textual understanding of prior knowledge empowers the loss agent with the potential to understand complex optimization objectives, trajectory, and state feedback from external environments in the optimization process of the low-level image processing networks. In particular, we establish the loss repository by incorporating existing loss functions that support the end-to-end optimization for low-level image processing. Then, we design the optimization-oriented prompt engineering for the loss agent to actively and intelligently decide the compositional weights for each loss in the repository at each optimization interaction, thereby achieving the required optimization trajectory for any customized optimization objectives. Extensive experiments on three typical low-level image processing tasks and multiple optimization objectives have shown the effectiveness and applicability of our proposed LossAgent.</p></details> | Update format |

Current prevalent binary decompilation methods primarily rely on large language models (LLMs) and can be broadly classified into two main approaches: prompt-based decompilation and end-toend decompilation. Prompt-based methods typically require significant effort to analyze and summarize the predicted data to extract aspect-specific expert knowledge, which is then fed into a general purpose large language model to address specific decompilation tasks. End-to-end methods, on the other hand, carefully construct training datasets or neural networks to perform post-training on general-purpose large language models, thereby obtaining domain-specific large language models for decompiling the predicted data. However, both existing approaches still face significant challenges, including the absence of rich semantic representations of the input code and the neglect of control flow information, which is crucial for accurate decompilation. Furthermore, most current decompilation techniques are specifically tailored for the x86 architecture, making it difficult to efficiently adapt and generalize them to other bit width or instruction architectures. To address these limitations, we propose a novel end-to-end decompilation LLM, CFADecLLM, which aims to enhance existing end-to-end decompilation methods. We conduct extensive experiments on the public dataset Humaneval and Exebench across four optimization levels, and results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in multiple metrics, validating its effectiveness and superiority.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Zero-shot Learning Method Based on Large Language Models for Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07202v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot learning (ZL) is crucial for tasks involving unseen categories, such as natural language processing, image classification, and cross-lingual transfer. Current applications often fail to accurately infer and handle new relations or entities involving unseen categories, severely limiting their scalability and practicality in open-domain scenarios. ZL learning faces the challenge of effectively transferring semantic information of unseen categories in multi-modal knowledge graph (MMKG) embedding representation learning. In this paper, we propose ZSLLM, a framework for zero-shot embedding learning of MMKGs using large language models (LLMs). We leverage textual modality information of unseen categories as prompts to fully utilize the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, enabling semantic information transfer across different modalities for unseen categories. Through model-based learning, the embedding representation of unseen categories in MMKG is enhanced. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Our approach is based on a powerful Vision and Large Language Model (VLLM) as a planner and a tool-augmentation paradigm using CAD-specific tools. CAD-Assistant addresses multimodal user queries by generating actions that are iteratively executed on a Python interpreter equipped with the FreeCAD software, accessed via its Python API. Our framework is able to assess the impact of generated CAD commands on geometry and adapts subsequent actions based on the evolving state of the CAD design. We consider a wide range of CAD-specific tools including a sketch image parameterizer, rendering modules, a 2D cross-section generator, and other specialized routines. CAD-Assistant is evaluated on multiple CAD benchmarks, where it outperforms VLLM baselines and supervised task-specific methods. Beyond existing benchmarks, we qualitatively demonstrate the potential of tool-augmented VLLMs as general-purpose CAD solvers across diverse workflows.</p></details> |  |

Using intermediate language translations as contextual cues, we evaluate their effectiveness in enhancing English and Chinese translations into Portuguese. Results suggest that contextual information significantly improves translation quality for domain-specific datasets and potentially for linguistically distant language pairs, with diminishing returns observed in benchmarks with high linguistic variability. Additionally, we demonstrate that shallow fusion, a multi-source approach we apply within the NMT system, shows improved results when using high-resource languages as context for other translation pairs, highlighting the importance of strategic context language selection.</p></details> | 11 pages |

In the first stage, we leverage a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategy to guide an LLM in generating an initial layout (Layout-Init) from natural language descriptions, which ensures a user-friendly and intuitive design process. However, Layout-Init may lack precise geometric alignment and fine-grained structural details. To address this, the second stage employs a conditional diffusion model to refine Layout-Init into a final floorplan (Layout-Final) that better adheres to physical constraints and user requirements. Unlike prior methods, our approach effectively reduces the difficulty of floorplan generation learning without the need for extensive domain-specific training data. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across all metrics, which validates its effectiveness in practical home design applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Commands to Prompts: LLM-based Semantic File System for AIOS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11843v4)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in the development of intelligent applications and systems such as LLM-based agents and agent operating systems (AIOS). However, when these applications and systems interact with the underlying file system, the file system still remains the traditional paradigm: reliant on manual navigation through precise commands. This paradigm poses a bottleneck to the usability of these systems as users are required to navigate complex folder hierarchies and remember cryptic file names. To address this limitation, we propose an LLM-based semantic file system ( LSFS ) for prompt-driven file management. Unlike conventional approaches, LSFS incorporates LLMs to enable users or agents to interact with files through natural language prompts, facilitating semantic file management. At the macro-level, we develop a comprehensive API set to achieve semantic file management functionalities, such as semantic file retrieval, file update monitoring and summarization, and semantic file rollback). At the micro-level, we store files by constructing semantic indexes for them, design and implement syscalls of different semantic operations (e.g., CRUD, group by, join) powered by vector database. Our experiments show that LSFS offers significant improvements over traditional file systems in terms of user convenience, the diversity of supported functions, and the accuracy and efficiency of file operations. Additionally, with the integration of LLM, our system enables more intelligent file management tasks, such as content summarization and version comparison, further enhancing its capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Existing MRC datasets primarily assess specific aspects of reading comprehension (RC), lacking a comprehensive MRC benchmark. To fill this gap, we first introduce a novel taxonomy that categorizes the key capabilities required for RC. Based on this taxonomy, we construct MRCEval, an MRC benchmark that leverages advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) as both sample generators and selection judges. MRCEval is a comprehensive, challenging and accessible benchmark designed to assess the RC capabilities of LLMs thoroughly, covering 13 distinct RC skills with a total of 2.1K high-quality multi-choice questions. We perform an extensive evaluation of 28 widely used open-source and proprietary models, highlighting that MRC continues to present significant challenges even in the era of LLMs.</p></details> | Under review |

To accomplish this task, large language models and multi-step reasoning are needed to identify those sentiments that are not explicitly stated. In this study, we propose a novel Dual Reverse Chain Reasoning (DRCR) framework to enhance the performance of implicit sentiment analysis. Inspired by deductive reasoning, the framework consists of three key steps: 1) hypothesize an emotional polarity and derive a reasoning process, 2) negate the initial hypothesis and derive a new reasoning process, and 3) contrast the two reasoning paths to deduce the final sentiment polarity. Building on this, we also introduce a Triple Reverse Chain Reasoning (TRCR) framework to address the limitations of random hypotheses. Both methods combine contrastive mechanisms and multi-step reasoning, significantly improving the accuracy of implicit sentiment classification. Experimental results demonstrate that both approaches outperform existing methods across various model scales, achieving state-of-the-art performance. This validates the effectiveness of combining contrastive reasoning and multi-step reasoning for implicit sentiment analysis.</p></details> |  |

Thus, predicting ADEs is key to developing safer medications and enhancing patient outcomes. To support this effort, we introduce CT-ADE, a dataset for multilabel ADE prediction in monopharmacy treatments. CT-ADE encompasses 2,497 drugs and 168,984 drug-ADE pairs from clinical trial results, annotated using the MedDRA ontology. Unlike existing resources, CT-ADE integrates treatment and target population data, enabling comparative analyses under varying conditions, such as dosage, administration route, and demographics. In addition, CT-ADE systematically collects all ADEs in the study population, including positive and negative cases. To provide a baseline for ADE prediction performance using the CT-ADE dataset, we conducted analyses using large language models (LLMs). The best LLM achieved an F1-score of 56%, with models incorporating treatment and patient information outperforming by 21%-38% those relying solely on the chemical structure. These findings underscore the importance of contextual information in ADE prediction and establish CT-ADE as a robust resource for safety risk assessment in pharmaceutical research and development.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, this paper proposes Graph2Token, an efficient solution that aligns graph tokens to LLM tokens. The key idea is to represent a graph token with the LLM token vocabulary, without fine-tuning the LLM backbone. To achieve this goal, we first construct a molecule-text paired dataset from multisources, including CHEBI and HMDB, to train a graph structure encoder, which reduces the distance between graphs and texts representations in the feature space. Then, we propose a novel alignment strategy that associates a graph token with LLM tokens. To further unleash the potential of LLMs, we collect molecular IUPAC name identifiers, which are incorporated into the LLM prompts. By aligning molecular graphs as special tokens, we can activate LLM generalization ability to molecular few-shot learning. Extensive experiments on molecular classification and regression tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Graph2Token.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2025 camera ready version</p></details> |

However, existing GZSL is still limited to seen domains. In the current work, we study cross-domain GZSL (CDGZSL) which addresses GZSL towards unseen domains. Different from existing GZSL methods, CDGZSL constructs a common feature space across domains and acquires the corresponding intrinsic semantics shared among domains to transfer from seen to unseen domains. Considering the information asymmetry problem caused by redundant class semantics annotated with large language models (LLMs), we present Meta Domain Alignment Semantic Refinement (MDASR). Technically, MDASR consists of two parts: Inter-class similarity alignment, which eliminates the non-intrinsic semantics not shared across all domains under the guidance of inter-class feature relationships, and unseen-class meta generation, which preserves intrinsic semantics to maintain connectivity between seen and unseen classes by simulating feature generation. MDASR effectively aligns the redundant semantic space with the common feature space, mitigating the information asymmetry in CDGZSL. The effectiveness of MDASR is demonstrated on two datasets, Office-Home and Mini-DomainNet, and we have shared the LLM-based semantics for these datasets as a benchmark.</p></details> |  |

This paper addresses the challenge of interpretable depression detection by proposing a novel methodology that effectively combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and conversational agents like ChatGPT. In our methodology, explanations are achieved by integrating BERTweet, a Twitter-specific variant of BERT, into a novel self-explanatory model, namely BERT-XDD, capable of providing both classification and explanations via masked attention. The interpretability is further enhanced using ChatGPT to transform technical explanations into human-readable commentaries. By introducing an effective and modular approach for interpretable depression detection, our methodology can contribute to the development of socially responsible digital platforms, fostering early intervention and support for mental health challenges under the guidance of qualified healthcare professionals.</p></details> |  |

The LLM effectiveness generally increases with its size: The higher the number of LLM's trainable parameters the better its ability to implement code. However, when it comes to deploying LLM-based code generators, larger LLMs pose significant challenges related to their memory (and, consequently, carbon) footprint. A previous work by Wei et al. proposed to leverage quantization techniques to reduce the memory footprint of LLM-based code generators without substantially degrading their effectiveness. In short, they studied LLMs featuring up to 16B parameters, quantizing their precision from floating point 32 bits down to int 8 bits and showing their limited impact on code generation performance. Given the fast pace at which LLM capabilities and quantization techniques are evolving, in this work we present a differentiated replication of the work by Wei et al. in which we consider (i) on the one side, more recent and larger code-related LLMs, of up to 34B parameters; (ii) the latest advancements in model quantization techniques, which allow pushing the compression to the extreme quantization level of 2 bits per model parameter and; (iii) different types of calibration datasets to guide the quantization process, including code-specific ones. Our empirical evaluation reveals that the new frontier for LLM quantization is 4-bit precision, resulting in an average memory footprint reduction of 70% compared to the original model without observing any significant decrease in performance. Additionally, when the quantization becomes even more extreme (3 and 2 bits), a code-specific calibration dataset helps to limit the loss of performance.</p></details> |  |

Building on this foundation, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) integrate LLMs with visual models to process diverse inputs, including clinical data and medical images. In ophthalmology, LLMs have been explored for analyzing optical coherence tomography (OCT) reports, assisting in disease classification, and even predicting treatment outcomes. However, existing MLLM benchmarks often fail to capture the complexities of real-world clinical practice, particularly in the analysis of OCT images. Many suffer from limitations such as small sample sizes, a lack of diverse OCT datasets, and insufficient expert validation. These shortcomings hinder the accurate assessment of MLLMs' ability to interpret OCT scans and their broader applicability in ophthalmology. Our dataset, curated through rigorous quality control and expert annotation, consists of 439 fundus images and 75 OCT images. Using a standardized API-based framework, we assessed seven mainstream MLLMs and observed significant variability in diagnostic accuracy across different diseases. While some models performed well in diagnosing conditions such as diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration, they struggled with others, including choroidal neovascularization and myopia, highlighting inconsistencies in performance and the need for further refinement. Our findings emphasize the importance of developing clinically relevant benchmarks to provide a more accurate assessment of MLLMs' capabilities. By refining these models and expanding their scope, we can enhance their potential to transform ophthalmic diagnosis and treatment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Linguistic Knowledge Transfer Learning for Speech Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07078v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linguistic knowledge plays a crucial role in spoken language comprehension. It provides essential semantic and syntactic context for speech perception in noisy environments. However, most speech enhancement (SE) methods predominantly rely on acoustic features to learn the mapping relationship between noisy and clean speech, with limited exploration of linguistic integration. While text-informed SE approaches have been investigated, they often require explicit speech-text alignment or externally provided textual data, constraining their practicality in real-world scenarios. Additionally, using text as input poses challenges in aligning linguistic and acoustic representations due to their inherent differences. In this study, we propose the Cross-Modality Knowledge Transfer (CMKT) learning framework, which leverages pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to infuse linguistic knowledge into SE models without requiring text input or LLMs during inference. Furthermore, we introduce a misalignment strategy to improve knowledge transfer. This strategy applies controlled temporal shifts, encouraging the model to learn more robust representations. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that CMKT consistently outperforms baseline models across various SE architectures and LLM embeddings, highlighting its adaptability to different configurations. Additionally, results on Mandarin and English datasets confirm its effectiveness across diverse linguistic conditions, further validating its robustness. Moreover, CMKT remains effective even in scenarios without textual data, underscoring its practicality for real-world applications. By bridging the gap between linguistic and acoustic modalities, CMKT offers a scalable and innovative solution for integrating linguistic knowledge into SE models, leading to substantial improvements in both intelligibility and enhancement performance.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

There have been a handful of research that focuses on empowering the RS by LLM. However, previous efforts mainly focus on LLM as RS, which may face the challenge of intolerant inference costs by LLM. Recently, the integration of LLM into RS, known as LLM-Enhanced Recommender Systems (LLMERS), has garnered significant interest due to its potential to address latency and memory constraints in real-world applications. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the latest research efforts aimed at leveraging LLM to enhance RS capabilities. We identify a critical shift in the field with the move towards incorporating LLM into the online system, notably by avoiding their use during inference. Our survey categorizes the existing LLMERS approaches into three primary types based on the component of the RS model being augmented: Knowledge Enhancement, Interaction Enhancement, and Model Enhancement. We provide an in-depth analysis of each category, discussing the methodologies, challenges, and contributions of recent studies. Furthermore, we highlight several promising research directions that could further advance the field of LLMERS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting the Generalization and Reasoning of Vision Language Models with Curriculum Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07065v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex visual-text tasks, their success heavily relies on massive model scaling, limiting their practical deployment. Small-scale VLMs offer a more practical alternative but face significant challenges when trained with traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), particularly in two aspects: out-of-domain (OOD) generalization and reasoning abilities, which significantly lags behind the contemporary Large language models (LLMs). To address these challenges, we propose Curriculum Reinforcement Finetuning (Curr-ReFT), a novel post-training paradigm specifically designed for small-scale VLMs. Inspired by the success of reinforcement learning in LLMs, Curr-ReFT comprises two sequential stages: (1) Curriculum Reinforcement Learning, which ensures steady progression of model capabilities through difficulty-aware reward design, transitioning from basic visual perception to complex reasoning tasks; and (2) Rejected Sampling-based Self-improvement, which maintains the fundamental capabilities of VLMs through selective learning from high-quality multimodal and language examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models trained with Curr-ReFT paradigm achieve state-of-the-art performance across various visual tasks in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. Moreover, our Curr-ReFT enhanced 3B model matches the performance of 32B-parameter models, demonstrating that efficient training paradigms can effectively bridge the gap between small and large models.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we introduce TCM3CEval, a benchmark assessing LLMs in TCM across three dimensions: core knowledge mastery, classical text understanding, and clinical decision-making. We evaluate diverse models, including international (e.g., GPT-4o), Chinese (e.g., InternLM), and medical-specific (e.g., PLUSE). Results show a performance hierarchy: all models have limitations in specialized subdomains like Meridian & Acupoint theory and Various TCM Schools, revealing gaps between current capabilities and clinical needs. Models with Chinese linguistic and cultural priors perform better in classical text interpretation and clinical reasoning. TCM-3CEval sets a standard for AI evaluation in TCM, offering insights for optimizing LLMs in culturally grounded medical domains. The benchmark is available on Medbench's TCM track, aiming to assess LLMs' TCM capabilities in basic knowledge, classic texts, and clinical decision-making through multidimensional questions and real cases.</p></details> |  |

Our key contribution is a formal foundation for strategy emergence through chain-of-thought reasoning without explicit optimization. Through a novel two-layer prompt architecture, our framework enables LLMs to craft demographically authentic victim personas while maintaining strategic coherence. We evaluate our approach using a dataset of 3,200 scam dialogues validated against 179 hours of human scam-baiting interactions, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing complex adversarial dynamics.

To address this challenge, in this study, we establish a standardized dataset and evaluation framework for medical imaging QC, systematically assessing large language models (LLMs) in image quality assessment and report standardization. Specifically, we first constructed and anonymized a dataset of 161 chest X-ray (CXR) radiographs and 219 CT reports for evaluation. Then, multiple LLMs, including Gemini 2.0-Flash, GPT-4o, and DeepSeek-R1, were evaluated based on recall, precision, and F1 score to detect technical errors and inconsistencies. Experimental results show that Gemini 2.0-Flash achieved a Macro F1 score of 90 in CXR tasks, demonstrating strong generalization but limited fine-grained performance. DeepSeek-R1 excelled in CT report auditing with a 62.23\% recall rate, outperforming other models. However, its distilled variants performed poorly, while InternLM2.5-7B-chat exhibited the highest additional discovery rate, indicating broader but less precise error detection. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs in medical imaging QC, with DeepSeek-R1 and Gemini 2.0-Flash demonstrating superior performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Combating Partial Perception Deficit in Autonomous Driving with Multimodal LLM Commonsense](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07020v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partial perception deficits can compromise autonomous vehicle safety by disrupting environmental understanding. Current protocols typically respond with immediate stops or minimal-risk maneuvers, worsening traffic flow and lacking flexibility for rare driving scenarios. In this paper, we propose LLM-RCO, a framework leveraging large language models to integrate human-like driving commonsense into autonomous systems facing perception deficits. LLM-RCO features four key modules: hazard inference, short-term motion planner, action condition verifier, and safety constraint generator. These modules interact with the dynamic driving environment, enabling proactive and context-aware control actions to override the original control policy of autonomous agents. To improve safety in such challenging conditions, we construct DriveLM-Deficit, a dataset of 53,895 video clips featuring deficits of safety-critical objects, complete with annotations for LLM-based hazard inference and motion planning fine-tuning. Extensive experiments in adverse driving conditions with the CARLA simulator demonstrate that systems equipped with LLM-RCO significantly improve driving performance, highlighting its potential for enhancing autonomous driving resilience against adverse perception deficits. Our results also show that LLMs fine-tuned with DriveLM-Deficit can enable more proactive movements instead of conservative stops in the context of perception deficits.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Multi-Session Personalized Conversation: A Large-Scale Dataset and Hierarchical Tree Framework for Implicit Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07018v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been a surge in the use of large language models (LLM) conversational agents to generate responses based on long-term history from multiple sessions. However, existing long-term open-domain dialogue datasets lack complex, real-world personalization and fail to capture implicit reasoning-where relevant information is embedded in subtle, syntactic, or semantically distant connections rather than explicit statements. In such cases, traditional retrieval methods fail to capture relevant context, and long-context modeling also becomes inefficient due to numerous complicated persona-related details. To address this gap, we introduce ImplexConv, a large-scale long-term dataset with 2,500 examples, each containing approximately 100 conversation sessions, designed to study implicit reasoning in personalized dialogues. Additionally, we propose TaciTree, a novel hierarchical tree framework that structures conversation history into multiple levels of summarization. Instead of brute-force searching all data, TaciTree enables an efficient, level-based retrieval process where models refine their search by progressively selecting relevant details. Our experiments demonstrate that TaciTree significantly improves the ability of LLMs to reason over long-term conversations with implicit contextual dependencies.</p></details> | Preprint |

Given the significant variability of environments, human operators often have specific preference requirements for exploration, such as prioritizing certain areas or optimizing for different aspects of efficiency. However, existing methods struggle to accommodate these human preferences adaptively, often requiring extensive parameter tuning or network retraining. With the recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), which have been widely applied to text-based planning and complex reasoning, their potential for enhancing autonomous exploration is becoming increasingly promising. Motivated by this, we propose an LLM-based human-preferred exploration framework that seamlessly integrates a mobile robot system with LLMs. By leveraging the reasoning and adaptability of LLMs, our approach enables intuitive and flexible preference control through natural language while maintaining a task success rate comparable to state-of-the-art traditional methods. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework effectively bridges the gap between human intent and policy preference in autonomous exploration, offering a more user-friendly and adaptable solution for real-world robotic applications.</p></details> | submitted to IROS'25 |
| **[Large Language Models Often Say One Thing and Do Another](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07003v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) increasingly become central to various applications and interact with diverse user populations, ensuring their reliable and consistent performance is becoming more important. This paper explores a critical issue in assessing the reliability of LLMs: the consistency between their words and deeds. To quantitatively explore this consistency, we developed a novel evaluation benchmark called the Words and Deeds Consistency Test (WDCT). The benchmark establishes a strict correspondence between word-based and deed-based questions across different domains, including opinion vs. action, non-ethical value vs. action, ethical value vs. action, and theory vs. application. The evaluation results reveal a widespread inconsistency between words and deeds across different LLMs and domains. Subsequently, we conducted experiments with either word alignment or deed alignment to observe their impact on the other aspect. The experimental results indicate that alignment only on words or deeds poorly and unpredictably influences the other aspect. This supports our hypothesis that the underlying knowledge guiding LLMs' word or deed choices is not contained within a unified space.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published on ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Towards Multi-Turn Multimodal Dialogue Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07002v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), built on large-scale pre-trained vision towers and language models, have shown great capabilities in multimodal understanding. However, most existing MLLMs are trained on single-turn vision question-answering tasks, which do not accurately reflect real-world human conversations. In this paper, we introduce MMDiag, a multi-turn multimodal dialogue dataset. This dataset is collaboratively generated through deliberately designed rules and GPT assistance, featuring strong correlations between questions, between questions and images, and among different image regions; thus aligning more closely with real-world scenarios. MMDiag serves as a strong benchmark for multi-turn multimodal dialogue learning and brings more challenges to the grounding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. Further, inspired by human vision processing, we present DiagNote, an MLLM equipped with multimodal grounding and reasoning capabilities. DiagNote consists of two modules (Deliberate and Gaze) interacting with each other to perform Chain-of-Thought and annotations respectively, throughout multi-turn dialogues. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of DiagNote in both grounding and jointly processing and reasoning with vision and language information over existing MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

Latency issues and the challenge of inferring variable human strategies hinder their ability to make autonomous decisions without explicit instructions. Through experiments with current independent System 1 and System 2 methods, we validate the necessity of using Dual Process Theory (DPT) in real-time tasks. We propose DPT-Agent, a novel language agent framework that integrates System 1 and System 2 for efficient real-time simultaneous human-AI collaboration. DPT-Agent's System 1 uses a Finite-state Machine (FSM) and code-as-policy for fast, intuitive, and controllable decision-making. DPT-Agent's System 2 integrates Theory of Mind (ToM) and asynchronous reflection to infer human intentions and perform reasoning-based autonomous decisions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DPT-Agent through further experiments with rule-based agents and human collaborators, showing significant improvements over mainstream LLM-based frameworks. DPT-Agent can effectively help LLMs convert correct slow thinking and reasoning into executable actions, thereby improving performance. To the best of our knowledge, DPT-Agent is the first language agent framework that achieves successful real-time simultaneous human-AI collaboration autonomously. Code of DPT-Agent can be found in https://github.com/sjtu-marl/DPT-Agent.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint under review.

We leverage RLVR to optimize the Omni model, significantly enhancing its performance in three key aspects: reasoning capability, emotion recognition accuracy, and generalization ability. The introduction of RLVR not only improves the model's overall performance on in-distribution data but also demonstrates superior robustness when evaluated on out-of-distribution datasets. More importantly, the improved reasoning capability enables clear analysis of the contributions of different modalities, particularly visual and audio information, in the emotion recognition process. This provides valuable insights into the optimization of multimodal large language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Utilizing Jailbreak Probability to Attack and Safeguard Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06989v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated their superior ability in understanding multimodal contents. However, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which exploit weaknesses in their safety alignment to generate harmful responses. Previous studies categorize jailbreaks as successful or failed based on whether responses contain malicious content. However, given the stochastic nature of MLLM responses, this binary classification of an input's ability to jailbreak MLLMs is inappropriate. Derived from this viewpoint, we introduce jailbreak probability to quantify the jailbreak potential of an input, which represents the likelihood that MLLMs generated a malicious response when prompted with this input. We approximate this probability through multiple queries to MLLMs. After modeling the relationship between input hidden states and their corresponding jailbreak probability using Jailbreak Probability Prediction Network (JPPN), we use continuous jailbreak probability for optimization. Specifically, we propose Jailbreak-Probability-based Attack (JPA) that optimizes adversarial perturbations on inputs to maximize jailbreak probability. To counteract attacks, we also propose two defensive methods: Jailbreak-Probability-based Finetuning (JPF) and Jailbreak-Probability-based Defensive Noise (JPDN), which minimizes jailbreak probability in the MLLM parameters and input space, respectively. Extensive experiments show that (1) JPA yields improvements (up to 28.38\%) under both white and black box settings compared to previous methods with small perturbation bounds and few iterations. (2) JPF and JPDN significantly reduce jailbreaks by at most over 60\%. Both of the above results demonstrate the significance of introducing jailbreak probability to make nuanced distinctions among input jailbreak abilities.</p></details> |  |

We propose a Bias Benchmark for Generation (BBG), an adaptation of the Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ), designed to evaluate social bias in long-form generation by having LLMs generate continuations of story prompts. Building our benchmark in English and Korean, we measure the probability of neutral and biased generations across ten LLMs. We also compare our long-form story generation evaluation results with multiple-choice BBQ evaluation, showing that the two approaches produce inconsistent results.</p></details> |  |
| **[InferDPT: Privacy-Preserving Inference for Black-box Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12214v7)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, have greatly simplified text generation tasks. However, they have also raised concerns about privacy risks such as data leakage and unauthorized data collection. Existing solutions for privacy-preserving inference face practical challenges related to computation time and communication costs. In this paper, we propose InferDPT, the first practical framework for the privacy-preserving Inference of black-box LLMs, implementing Differential Privacy in Text generation. InferDPT comprises two key modules: the "perturbation module" utilizes the exponential mechanism to generate a perturbed prompt, facilitating privacy-preserving inference with black-box LLMs, and the "extraction module", inspired by knowledge distillation and retrieval-augmented generation, extracts coherent and consistent text from the perturbed generation result, ensuring successful text generation completion. To address privacy concerns related to previous exponential mechanisms' susceptibility to embedding revision attacks, we introduce RANTEXT, a novel differential privacy mechanism integrated into the perturbation module of InferDPT, which introduces the concept of "RANdom adjacency" for TEXT perturbation within the prompt. Experimental results across three datasets demonstrate that the text generation quality of InferDPT is comparable to that of non-private GPT-4, and RANTEXT surpasses existing state-of-the-art mechanisms, namely, SANTEXT+ and CUSTEXT+ in the trade-off between privacy and utility. Even with an privacy parameter epsilon value of 6.0, RANTEXT achieves an average privacy protection rate exceeding 90% against embedding revision attacks, which is 0.58 times higher than that of SANTEXT+ and 3.35 times higher than that of CUSTEXT+.</p></details> |  |

Utilizing perceptual strength ratings as a benchmark, the research compared GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o, and GPT-4o-mini, highlighting the influence of multimodal inputs on grounding and linguistic reasoning. While GPT-4 and GPT-4o demonstrated strong alignment with human evaluations and significant advancements over smaller models, qualitative analyses revealed distinct differences in processing patterns, such as multisensory overrating and reliance on loose semantic associations. Despite integrating multimodal capabilities, GPT-4o did not exhibit superior grounding compared to GPT-4, raising questions about their role in improving human-like grounding. These findings underscore how LLMs' reliance on linguistic patterns can both approximate and diverge from human embodied cognition, revealing limitations in replicating sensory experiences.</p></details> | <details><summary>under...</summary><p>under review, 15 pages</p></details> |
| **[Differentially Private Zeroth-Order Methods for Scalable Large Language Model Finetuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07818v6)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning on task-specific datasets is a widely-embraced paradigm of harnessing the powerful capability of pretrained LLMs for various downstream tasks. Due to the popularity of LLMs fine-tuning and its accompanying privacy concerns, differentially private (DP) fine-tuning of pretrained LLMs has been widely used to safeguarding the privacy of task-specific datasets. Lying at the design core of DP LLM fine-tuning methods is the satisfactory tradeoff among privacy, utility, and scalability. Most existing methods build upon the seminal work of DP-SGD. Despite pushing the scalability of DP-SGD to its limit, DP-SGD-based fine-tuning methods are unfortunately limited by the inherent inefficiency of SGD. In this paper, we investigate the potential of DP zeroth-order methods for LLM pretraining, which avoids the scalability bottleneck of SGD by approximating the gradient with the more efficient zeroth-order gradient. Rather than treating the zeroth-order method as a drop-in replacement for SGD, this paper presents a comprehensive study both theoretically and empirically. First, we propose the stagewise DP zeroth-order method (DP-ZOSO) that dynamically schedules key hyperparameters. This design is grounded on the synergy between DP random perturbation and the gradient approximation error of the zeroth-order method, and its effect on fine-tuning trajectory. We provide theoretical analysis for both proposed methods. We conduct extensive empirical analysis on both encoder-only masked language model and decoder-only autoregressive language model, achieving impressive results in terms of scalability and utility regardless of the class of tasks (compared with DPZero, DP-ZOPO improves $4.5\%$ on SST-5, $5.5\%$ on MNLI with RoBERTa-Large and 9.2\% on CB, 3.9\% on BoolQ with OPT-2.7b when $\epsilon=4$, demonstrates more significant enhancement in performance on more complicated tasks).</p></details> |  |
| **[PanguIR Technical Report for NTCIR-18 AEOLLM Task](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04809v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) gain widespread attention in both academia and industry, it becomes increasingly critical and challenging to effectively evaluate their capabilities. Existing evaluation methods can be broadly categorized into two types: manual evaluation and automatic evaluation. Manual evaluation, while comprehensive, is often costly and resource-intensive. Conversely, automatic evaluation offers greater scalability but is constrained by the limitations of its evaluation criteria (dominated by reference-based answers). To address these challenges, NTCIR-18 introduced the AEOLLM (Automatic Evaluation of LLMs) task, aiming to encourage reference-free evaluation methods that can overcome the limitations of existing approaches. In this paper, to enhance the evaluation performance of the AEOLLM task, we propose three key methods to improve the reference-free evaluation: 1) Multi-model Collaboration: Leveraging multiple LLMs to approximate human ratings across various subtasks; 2) Prompt Auto-optimization: Utilizing LLMs to iteratively refine the initial task prompts based on evaluation feedback from training samples; and 3) In-context Learning (ICL) Optimization: Based on the multi-task evaluation feedback, we train a specialized in-context example retrieval model, combined with a semantic relevance retrieval model, to jointly identify the most effective in-context learning examples. Experiments conducted on the final dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance on the AEOLLM task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lightweight Multimodal Artificial Intelligence Framework for Maritime Multi-Scene Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06978v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maritime Multi-Scene Recognition is crucial for enhancing the capabilities of intelligent marine robotics, particularly in applications such as marine conservation, environmental monitoring, and disaster response. However, this task presents significant challenges due to environmental interference, where marine conditions degrade image quality, and the complexity of maritime scenes, which requires deeper reasoning for accurate recognition. Pure vision models alone are insufficient to address these issues. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel multimodal Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework that integrates image data, textual descriptions and classification vectors generated by a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM), to provide richer semantic understanding and improve recognition accuracy. Our framework employs an efficient multimodal fusion mechanism to further enhance model robustness and adaptability in complex maritime environments. Experimental results show that our model achieves 98$\%$ accuracy, surpassing previous SOTA models by 3.5$\%$. To optimize deployment on resource-constrained platforms, we adopt activation-aware weight quantization (AWQ) as a lightweight technique, reducing the model size to 68.75MB with only a 0.5$\%$ accuracy drop while significantly lowering computational overhead. This work provides a high-performance solution for real-time maritime scene recognition, enabling Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs) to support environmental monitoring and disaster response in resource-limited settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 4 figures, submitted to Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |
| **[Prompt-to-Leaderboard](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14855v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) evaluations typically rely on aggregated metrics like accuracy or human preference, averaging across users and prompts. This averaging obscures user- and prompt-specific variations in model performance. To address this, we propose Prompt-to-Leaderboard (P2L), a method that produces leaderboards specific to a prompt. The core idea is to train an LLM taking natural language prompts as input to output a vector of Bradley-Terry coefficients which are then used to predict the human preference vote. The resulting prompt-dependent leaderboards allow for unsupervised task-specific evaluation, optimal routing of queries to models, personalization, and automated evaluation of model strengths and weaknesses. Data from Chatbot Arena suggest that P2L better captures the nuanced landscape of language model performance than the averaged leaderboard. Furthermore, our findings suggest that P2L's ability to produce prompt-specific evaluations follows a power law scaling similar to that observed in LLMs themselves. In January 2025, the router we trained based on this methodology achieved the #1 spot on the Chatbot Arena leaderboard. Our code is available on GitHub at https://github.com/lmarena/p2l.</p></details> |  |
| **[ControlAR: Controllable Image Generation with Autoregressive Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02705v3)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive (AR) models have reformulated image generation as next-token prediction, demonstrating remarkable potential and emerging as strong competitors to diffusion models. However, control-to-image generation, akin to ControlNet, remains largely unexplored within AR models. Although a natural approach, inspired by advancements in Large Language Models, is to tokenize control images into tokens and prefill them into the autoregressive model before decoding image tokens, it still falls short in generation quality compared to ControlNet and suffers from inefficiency. To this end, we introduce ControlAR, an efficient and effective framework for integrating spatial controls into autoregressive image generation models. Firstly, we explore control encoding for AR models and propose a lightweight control encoder to transform spatial inputs (e.g., canny edges or depth maps) into control tokens. Then ControlAR exploits the conditional decoding method to generate the next image token conditioned on the per-token fusion between control and image tokens, similar to positional encodings. Compared to prefilling tokens, using conditional decoding significantly strengthens the control capability of AR models but also maintains the model's efficiency. Furthermore, the proposed ControlAR surprisingly empowers AR models with arbitrary-resolution image generation via conditional decoding and specific controls. Extensive experiments can demonstrate the controllability of the proposed ControlAR for the autoregressive control-to-image generation across diverse inputs, including edges, depths, and segmentation masks. Furthermore, both quantitative and qualitative results indicate that ControlAR surpasses previous state-of-the-art controllable diffusion models, e.g., ControlNet++. Code, models, and demo will soon be available at https://github.com/hustvl/ControlAR.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, this paradigm faces a deep-rooted one-pass issue whereby each generated intermediate thought is plugged into the trajectory regardless of its correctness, which can cause irreversible error propagation. To address the issue, this paper proposes a novel framework called Generator-Assistant Stepwise Rollback (GA-Rollback) to induce better decision-making for LLM agents. Particularly, GA-Rollback utilizes a generator to interact with the environment and an assistant to examine each action produced by the generator, where the assistant triggers a rollback operation upon detection of incorrect actions. Moreover, we introduce two additional strategies tailored for the rollback scenario to further improve its effectiveness. Extensive experiments show that GA-Rollback achieves significant improvements over several strong baselines on three widely used benchmarks. Our analysis further reveals that GA-Rollback can function as a robust plug-and-play module, integrating seamlessly with other methods.</p></details> |  |

Existing attacks on LLM reasoning are constrained by specific settings or lack of imperceptibility, limiting their feasibility and generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose the Stepwise rEasoning Error Disruption (SEED) attack, which subtly injects errors into prior reasoning steps to mislead the model into producing incorrect subsequent reasoning and final answers. Unlike previous methods, SEED is compatible with zero-shot and few-shot settings, maintains the natural reasoning flow, and ensures covert execution without modifying the instruction. Extensive experiments on four datasets across four different models demonstrate SEED's effectiveness, revealing the vulnerabilities of LLMs to disruptions in reasoning processes. These findings underscore the need for greater attention to the robustness of LLM reasoning to ensure safety in practical applications.</p></details> |  |

However, concerns regarding copyright infringement arise as LLMs may inadvertently produce copyrighted material. In this paper, we first investigate the effectiveness of watermarking LLMs as a deterrent against the generation of copyrighted texts. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that incorporating watermarks into LLMs significantly reduces the likelihood of generating copyrighted content, thereby addressing a critical concern in the deployment of LLMs. However, we also find that watermarking can have unintended consequences on Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), which aim to discern whether a sample was part of the pretraining dataset and may be used to detect copyright violations. Surprisingly, we find that watermarking adversely affects the success rate of MIAs, complicating the task of detecting copyrighted text in the pretraining dataset. These results reveal the complex interplay between different regulatory measures, which may impact each other in unforeseen ways. Finally, we propose an adaptive technique to improve the success rate of a recent MIA under watermarking. Our findings underscore the importance of developing adaptive methods to study critical problems in LLMs with potential legal implications.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 7 figures.

The abundance of user-generated reviews on social media encapsulates nuanced perceptions and feelings associated with different places, offering rich insights into segregation. However, leveraging this data poses significant challenges due to its vast volume, ambiguity, and confluence of diverse perspectives. To tackle these challenges, we propose using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate online review mining for segregation prediction. We design a Reflective LLM Coder to digest social media content into insights consistent with real-world feedback, and eventually produce a codebook capturing key dimensions that signal segregation experience, such as cultural resonance and appeal, accessibility and convenience, and community engagement and local involvement. Guided by the codebook, LLMs can generate both informative review summaries and ratings for segregation prediction. Moreover, we design a REasoning-and-EMbedding (RE'EM) framework, which combines the reasoning and embedding capabilities of language models to integrate multi-channel features for segregation prediction. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our framework greatly improves prediction accuracy, with a 22.79% elevation in R2 and a 9.33% reduction in MSE. The derived codebook is generalizable across three different cities, consistently improving prediction accuracy. Moreover, our user study confirms that the codebook-guided summaries provide cognitive gains for human participants in perceiving POIs' social inclusiveness.

This work takes one step in this direction. Robi Butler is a new household robot assistant that enables seamless multimodal remote interaction. It allows the human user to monitor its environment from a first-person view, issue voice or text commands, and specify target objects through hand-pointing gestures. At its core, a high-level behavior module, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), interprets multimodal instructions to generate multistep action plans. Each plan consists of open-vocabulary primitives supported by vision-language models, enabling the robot to process both textual and gestural inputs. Zoom provides a convenient interface to implement remote interactions between the human and the robot. The integration of these components allows Robi Butler to ground remote multimodal instructions in real-world home environments in a zero-shot manner. We evaluated the system on various household tasks, demonstrating its ability to execute complex user commands with multimodal inputs. We also conducted a user study to examine how multimodal interaction influences user experiences in remote human-robot interaction. These results suggest that with the advances in robot foundation models, we are moving closer to the reality of remote household robot assistants.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

However, the irreversible nature of CoT leads to error accumulation, making it challenging to correct mistakes in multi-hop reasoning. This paper introduces ReAgent: a Reversible multi-Agent collaborative framework augmented with explicit backtracking mechanisms, enabling reversible multi-hop reasoning. By incorporating text-based retrieval, information aggregation and validation, our system can detect and correct errors mid-reasoning, leading to more robust and interpretable QA outcomes. The framework and experiments serve as a foundation for future work on error-tolerant QA systems. Empirical evaluations across three benchmarks indicate ReAgent's efficacy, yielding average about 6\% improvements against baseline models.</p></details> | 25pages, 3 figures |

However, this integration introduces a new security threat: adversaries can exploit the retrieval mechanism to inject malicious content into the knowledge base, thereby influencing the generated responses. Based on this attack vector, we propose CtrlRAG, a novel attack method designed for RAG system in the black-box setting, which aligns with real-world scenarios. Unlike existing attack methods, CtrlRAG introduces a perturbation mechanism using Masked Language Model (MLM) to dynamically optimize malicious content in response to changes in the retrieved context. Experimental results demonstrate that CtrlRAG outperforms three baseline methods in both Emotional Manipulation and Hallucination Amplification objectives. Furthermore, we evaluate three existing defense mechanisms, revealing their limited effectiveness against CtrlRAG and underscoring the urgent need for more robust defenses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lshan-1.0 Technical Report](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06949v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this report, we introduce our first-generation reasoning model, Lshan-1.0, a large language model designed for the highly specialized Chinese legal domain, offering comprehensive capabilities to meet diverse realistic needs. Existing legal LLMs face two primary challenges. Firstly, their design and evaluation are predominantly driven by computer science perspectives, leading to insufficient incorporation of legal expertise and logic, which is crucial for high-precision legal applications, such as handling complex prosecutorial tasks. Secondly, these models often underperform due to a lack of comprehensive training data from the legal domain, limiting their ability to effectively address real-world legal scenarios. To address this, we first compile millions of legal documents covering over 20 types of crimes from 31 provinces in China for model training. From the extensive dataset, we further select high-quality for supervised fine-tuning, ensuring enhanced relevance and precision. The model further undergoes large-scale reinforcement learning without additional supervision, emphasizing the enhancement of its reasoning capabilities and explainability. To validate its effectiveness in complex legal applications, we also conduct human evaluations with legal experts. We develop fine-tuned models based on DeepSeek-R1-Distilled versions, available in three dense configurations: 14B, 32B, and 70B.</p></details> |  |

To address this problem, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM) guided Progressive feature Alignment Network called LPANet, which leverages the semantic features extracted from a large language model to guide the progressive semantic and spatial alignment between modalities for multimodal UAV object detection. To employ the powerful semantic representation of LLM, we generate the fine-grained text descriptions of each object category by ChatGPT and then extract the semantic features using the large language model MPNet. Based on the semantic features, we guide the semantic and spatial alignments in a progressive manner as follows. First, we design the Semantic Alignment Module (SAM) to pull the semantic features and multimodal visual features of each object closer, alleviating the semantic differences of objects between modalities. Second, we design the Explicit Spatial alignment Module (ESM) by integrating the semantic relations into the estimation of feature-level offsets, alleviating the coarse spatial misalignment between modalities. Finally, we design the Implicit Spatial alignment Module (ISM), which leverages the cross-modal correlations to aggregate key features from neighboring regions to achieve implicit spatial alignment. Comprehensive experiments on two public multimodal UAV object detection datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal UAV object detectors.</p></details> |  |

The parameter usage in semantic SLAM systems increases significantly with the growing complexity of the environment, making it particularly challenging and costly for scene understanding. To address this problem, we introduce a novel hierarchical representation that encodes semantic information in a compact form into 3D Gaussian Splatting, leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). We further introduce a novel semantic loss designed to optimize hierarchical semantic information through both inter-level and cross-level optimization. Furthermore, we enhance the whole SLAM system, resulting in improved tracking and mapping performance. Our \MethodName{} outperforms existing dense SLAM methods in both mapping and tracking accuracy, while achieving a 2x operation speed-up. Additionally, it achieves on-par semantic rendering performance compared to existing methods while significantly reducing storage and training time requirements. Rendering FPS impressively reaches 2,000 with semantic information and 3,000 without it. Most notably, it showcases the capability of handling the complex real-world scene with more than 500 semantic classes, highlighting its valuable scaling-up capability.

These methods retrieve useful moments from long videos for their presented tasks, thereby enabling multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate high-quality answers in a cost-effective way. In this work, we present MomentSeeker, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate retrieval models' performance in handling general long-video moment retrieval (LVMR) tasks. MomentSeeker offers three key advantages. First, it incorporates long videos of over 500 seconds on average, making it the first benchmark specialized for long-video moment retrieval. Second, it covers a wide range of task categories (including Moment Search, Caption Alignment, Image-conditioned Moment Search, and Video-conditioned Moment Search) and diverse application scenarios (e.g., sports, movies, cartoons, and ego), making it a comprehensive tool for assessing retrieval models' general LVMR performance. Additionally, the evaluation tasks are carefully curated through human annotation, ensuring the reliability of assessment. We further fine-tune an MLLM-based LVMR retriever on synthetic data, which demonstrates strong performance on our benchmark. We perform extensive experiments with various popular multimodal retrievers based on our benchmark, whose results highlight the challenges of LVMR and limitations for existing methods. Our created resources will be shared with community to advance future research in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Post-Training Quantization for Diffusion Transformer via Hierarchical Timestep Grouping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06930v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has now become the preferred choice for building image generation models due to its great generation capability. Unlike previous convolution-based UNet models, DiT is purely composed of a stack of transformer blocks, which renders DiT excellent in scalability like large language models. However, the growing model size and multi-step sampling paradigm bring about considerable pressure on deployment and inference. In this work, we propose a post-training quantization framework tailored for Diffusion Transforms to tackle these challenges. We firstly locate that the quantization difficulty of DiT mainly originates from the time-dependent channel-specific outliers. We propose a timestep-aware shift-and-scale strategy to smooth the activation distribution to reduce the quantization error. Secondly, based on the observation that activations of adjacent timesteps have similar distributions, we utilize a hierarchical clustering scheme to divide the denoising timesteps into multiple groups. We further design a re-parameterization scheme which absorbs the quantization parameters into nearby module to avoid redundant computations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that out PTQ method successfully quantize the Diffusion Transformer into 8-bit weight and 8-bit activation (W8A8) with state-of-the-art FiD score. And our method can further quantize DiT model into 4-bit weight and 8-bit activation (W4A8) without sacrificing generation quality.</p></details> |  |

Through an extensive experimental study, we compared two selection formats -- bullet points and plain English -- to determine their impact on model performance.

Although LLMs excel at interpreting nuanced, locally specified requirements, they struggle with enforcing global combinatorial feasibility. To bridge this gap, we propose an iterated fine-tuning framework where algorithmic feedback progressively refines the LLM's output distribution. Interpreting this as simulated annealing, we introduce a formal model based on a "coarse learnability" assumption, providing sample complexity bounds for convergence. Empirical evaluations on scheduling, graph connectivity, and clustering tasks demonstrate that our framework balances the flexibility of locally expressed constraints with rigorous global optimization more effectively compared to baseline sampling methods. Our results highlight a promising direction for hybrid AI-driven combinatorial reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Program design, like other design activity, is characterized by navigating a space of alternative problem formulations and associated solutions in an iterative fashion. LLMs are potentially powerful tools in helping this exploration; however, by default, code-generation LLMs deliver code that represents a particular point solution. This obscures the larger space of possible alternatives, many of which might be preferable to the LLM's default interpretation and its generated code. We contribute an IDE that supports program design through generating and showing new ways to frame problems alongside alternative solutions, tracking design decisions, and identifying implicit decisions made by either the programmer or the LLM. In a user study, we find that with our IDE, users combine and parallelize design phases to explore a broader design space -- but also struggle to keep up with LLM-originated changes to code and other information overload. These findings suggest a core challenge for future IDEs that support program design through higher-level instructions given to LLM-based agents: carefully managing attention and deciding what information agents should surface to program designers and when.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages; 4 figures; 1 table; to appear in CHI '25</p></details> |

However, due to the lack of labeled data and the difficulty of manual annotation for biochemical properties, the performance for molecule generation tasks is still limited, especially for tasks involving multi-properties constraints. In this work, we present a two-step framework PEIT (Property Enhanced Instruction Tuning) to improve LLMs for molecular-related tasks. In the first step, we use textual descriptions, SMILES, and biochemical properties as multimodal inputs to pre-train a model called PEIT-GEN, by aligning multi-modal representations to synthesize instruction data. In the second step, we fine-tune existing open-source LLMs with the synthesized data, the resulting PEIT-LLM can handle molecule captioning, text-based molecule generation, molecular property prediction, and our newly proposed multi-constraint molecule generation tasks. Experimental results show that our pre-trained PEIT-GEN outperforms MolT5 and BioT5 in molecule captioning, demonstrating modalities align well between textual descriptions, structures, and biochemical properties. Furthermore, PEIT-LLM shows promising improvements in multi-task molecule generation, proving the scalability of the PEIT framework for various molecular tasks. We release the code, constructed instruction data, and model checkpoints in https://github.com/chenlong164/PEIT.</p></details> | 9 |

This work explores the potential of LLMs in pathway reasoning. We introduce BioMaze, a dataset with 5.1K complex pathway problems derived from real research, covering various biological contexts including natural dynamic changes, disturbances, additional intervention conditions, and multi-scale research targets. Our evaluation of methods such as CoT and graph-augmented reasoning, shows that LLMs struggle with pathway reasoning, especially in perturbed systems. To address this, we propose PathSeeker, an LLM agent that enhances reasoning through interactive subgraph-based navigation, enabling a more effective approach to handling the complexities of biological systems in a scientifically aligned manner.

Understanding the contextual information associated with real-world time series data is often essential for accurate and reliable event predictions. In this paper, we introduce TimeCAP, a time-series processing framework that creatively employs Large Language Models (LLMs) as contextualizers of time series data, extending their typical usage as predictors. TimeCAP incorporates two independent LLM agents: one generates a textual summary capturing the context of the time series, while the other uses this enriched summary to make more informed predictions. In addition, TimeCAP employs a multi-modal encoder that synergizes with the LLM agents, enhancing predictive performance through mutual augmentation of inputs with in-context examples. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that TimeCAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods for time series event prediction, including those utilizing LLMs as predictors, achieving an average improvement of 28.75% in F1 score.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |
| **[A Query Optimization Method Utilizing Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06902v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Query optimization is a critical task in database systems, focused on determining the most efficient way to execute a query from an enormous set of possible strategies. Traditional approaches rely on heuristic search methods and cost predictions, but these often struggle with the complexity of the search space and inaccuracies in performance estimation, leading to suboptimal plan choices. This paper presents LLMOpt, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to address these challenges through two innovative components: (1) LLM for Plan Candidate Generation (LLMOpt(G)), which eliminates heuristic search by utilizing the reasoning abilities of LLMs to directly generate high-quality query plans, and (2) LLM for Plan Candidate Selection (LLMOpt(S)), a list-wise cost model that compares candidates globally to enhance selection accuracy. To adapt LLMs for query optimization, we propose fine-tuning pre-trained models using optimization data collected offline. Experimental results on the JOB, JOB-EXT, and Stack benchmarks show that LLMOpt(G) and LLMOpt(S) outperform state-of-the-art methods, including PostgreSQL, BAO, and HybridQO. Notably, LLMOpt(S) achieves the best practical performance, striking a balance between plan quality and inference efficiency.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, this paper introduces a Video Understanding and Reasoning Framework (VURF) based on the reasoning power of LLMs. Ours is a novel approach to extend the utility of LLMs in the context of video tasks, leveraging their capacity to generalize from minimal input and output demonstrations within a contextual framework. We harness their contextual learning capabilities by presenting LLMs with pairs of instructions and their corresponding high-level programs to generate executable visual programs for video understanding. To enhance the program's accuracy and robustness, we implement two important strategies. \emph{Firstly,} we employ a feedback-generation approach, powered by GPT-3.5, to rectify errors in programs utilizing unsupported functions. \emph{Secondly}, taking motivation from recent works on self-refinement of LLM outputs, we introduce an iterative procedure for improving the quality of the in-context examples by aligning the initial outputs to the outputs that would have been generated had the LLM not been bound by the structure of the in-context examples. Our results on several video-specific tasks, including visual QA, video anticipation, pose estimation, and multi-video QA, illustrate these enhancements' efficacy in improving the performance of visual programming approaches for video tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, despite their benefits, the growing adoption of LLM in robotics has raised several safety concerns, particularly regarding executing malicious or unsafe natural language prompts. In addition, ensuring that task plans, team formation, and task allocation outputs from LLMs are adequately examined, refined, or rejected is crucial for maintaining system integrity. In this paper, we introduce SafePlan, a multi-component framework that combines formal logic and chain-of-thought reasoners for enhancing the safety of LLM-based robotics systems. Using the components of SafePlan, including Prompt Sanity COT Reasoner and Invariant, Precondition, and Postcondition COT reasoners, we examined the safety of natural language task prompts, task plans, and task allocation outputs generated by LLM-based robotic systems as means of investigating and enhancing system safety profile. Our results show that SafePlan outperforms baseline models by leading to 90.5% reduction in harmful task prompt acceptance while still maintaining reasonable acceptance of safe tasks.</p></details> |  |

The sparse structure, while allowing constant time costs, results in space inefficiency: we still need to load all the model parameters during inference. We introduce ResMoE, an innovative MoE approximation framework that utilizes Wasserstein barycenter to extract a common expert (barycenter expert) and approximate the residuals between this barycenter expert and the original ones. ResMoE enhances the space efficiency for inference of large-scale MoE Transformers in a one-shot and data-agnostic manner without retraining while maintaining minimal accuracy loss, thereby paving the way for broader accessibility to large language models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ResMoE through extensive experiments on Switch Transformer, Mixtral, and DeepSeekMoE models. The results show that ResMoE can reduce the number of parameters in an expert by up to 75% while maintaining comparable performance.

Investigating Risks of Animal Harm in Generated Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04804v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As machine learning systems become increasingly embedded in human society, their impact on the natural world continues to escalate. Technical evaluations have addressed a variety of potential harms from large language models (LLMs) towards humans and the environment, but there is little empirical work regarding harms towards nonhuman animals. Following the growing recognition of animal protection in regulatory and ethical AI frameworks, we present the Animal Harm Assessment (AHA), a novel evaluation of risks of animal harm in LLM-generated text. Our dataset comprises 1,850 curated questions from Reddit post titles and 2,500 synthetic questions based on 50 animal categories (e.g., cats, reptiles) and 50 ethical scenarios, with further 70-30 public-private split. Scenarios include open-ended questions about how to treat animals, practical scenarios with potential animal harm, and willingness-to-pay measures for the prevention of animal harm. Using the LLM-as-a-judge framework, answers are evaluated for their potential to increase or decrease harm, and evaluations are debiased for the tendency to judge their own outputs more favorably. We show that AHA produces meaningful evaluation results when applied to frontier LLMs, revealing significant differences between models, animal categories, scenarios, and subreddits. We conclude with future directions for technical research and the challenges of building evaluations on complex social and moral topics.</p></details> |  |

However, while LLMs have been explored for generating feasible task sequences, their ability to ensure safe task execution remains underdeveloped. Existing methods struggle with structured risk perception, making them inadequate for safety-critical applications where low-latency hazard adaptation is required. To address this limitation, we propose a Graphormer-enhanced risk-aware task planning framework that combines LLM-based decision-making with structured safety modeling. Our approach constructs a dynamic spatio-semantic safety graph, capturing spatial and contextual risk factors to enable online hazard detection and adaptive task refinement. Unlike existing methods that rely on predefined safety constraints, our framework introduces a context-aware risk perception module that continuously refines safety predictions based on real-time task execution. This enables a more flexible and scalable approach to robotic planning, allowing for adaptive safety compliance beyond static rules. To validate our framework, we conduct experiments in the AI2-THOR environment. The experiments results validates improvements in risk detection accuracy, rising safety notice, and task adaptability of our framework in continuous environments compared to static rule-based and LLM-only baselines.

Despite the remarkable progress, we notice that existing works are heavily dependent on human-designed frameworks, which greatly limits the functional scope and scalability of agent systems. How to automatically extend the specialized agent to multi-agent systems to improve task-solving capability still remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce EvoAgent, a generic method to automatically extend specialized agents to multi-agent systems via the evolutionary algorithm, thereby improving the effectiveness of LLM-based agents in solving tasks. Specifically, we consider the existing agent frameworks as the initial individual and then apply a series of evolutionary operators (e.g., mutation, crossover, selection, etc.) to generate multiple agents with diverse settings. Experimental results across various tasks show that EvoAgent can significantly enhance the task-solving capability of LLM-based agents, and can be generalized to any LLM-based agent framework to extend them into multi-agent systems.

However, it necessitates FP-INT operations, which make implementation on general-purpose hardware like GPUs difficult. In this paper, we propose FIGLUT, an efficient look-up table (LUT)-based GEMM accelerator architecture. Instead of performing traditional arithmetic operations, FIGLUT retrieves precomputed values from an LUT based on weight patterns, significantly reducing the computational complexity. We also introduce a novel LUT design that addresses the limitations of conventional memory architectures. To further improve LUT-based operations, we propose a half-size LUT combined with a dedicated decoding and multiplexing unit. FIGLUT efficiently supports different bit precisions and quantization methods using a single fixed hardware configuration. For the same 3-bit weight precision, FIGLUT demonstrates 59% higher TOPS/W and 20% lower perplexity than state-of-the-art accelerator designs.

Despite the considerable research in natural language processing for dataset extraction, effective approaches for multi-tuple extraction in scientific literature remain scarce due to the complex interrelations of tuples and contextual ambiguities. In the study, we illustrate the multi-tuple extraction of mechanical properties from multi-principal-element alloys and presents a novel framework that combines an entity extraction model based on MatSciBERT with pointer networks and an allocation model utilizing inter- and intra-entity attention. Our rigorous experiments on tuple extraction demonstrate impressive F1 scores of 0.963, 0.947, 0.848, and 0.753 across datasets with 1, 2, 3, and 4 tuples, confirming the effectiveness of the model. Furthermore, an F1 score of 0.854 was achieved on a randomly curated dataset. These results highlight the model's capacity to deliver precise and structured information, offering a robust alternative to large language models and equipping researchers with essential data for fostering data-driven innovations.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |

However, we find that MM-RMs trained on existing datasets often struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution data due to their reliance on unimodal spurious correlations, primarily text-only shortcuts within the training distribution, which prevents them from leveraging true multimodal reward functions. To address this, we introduce a Shortcut-aware MM-RM learning algorithm that mitigates this issue by dynamically reweighting training samples, shifting the distribution toward better multimodal understanding, and reducing dependence on unimodal spurious correlations. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in generalization, downstream task performance, and scalability, establishing a more robust framework for multimodal reward modeling.</p></details> |  |

We demonstrate that RAG systems that operate on databases with untrusted content are vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks we call jamming. An adversary can add a single ``blocker'' document to the database that will be retrieved in response to a specific query and result in the RAG system not answering this query, ostensibly because it lacks relevant information or because the answer is unsafe. We describe and measure the efficacy of several methods for generating blocker documents, including a new method based on black-box optimization. Our method (1) does not rely on instruction injection, (2) does not require the adversary to know the embedding or LLM used by the target RAG system, and (3) does not employ an auxiliary LLM. We evaluate jamming attacks on several embeddings and LLMs and demonstrate that the existing safety metrics for LLMs do not capture their vulnerability to jamming. We then discuss defenses against blocker documents.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in USENIX Security Symposium 2025</p></details> |

However, the specialized nature of biochemical data often necessitates costly domain-specific fine-tuning, posing critical challenges. First, it hinders the application of more flexible general-purpose LLMs in cutting-edge drug discovery tasks. More importantly, it impedes the rapid integration of the vast amounts of scientific data continuously generated through experiments and research. To investigate these challenges, we propose CLADD, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-empowered agentic system tailored to drug discovery tasks. Through the collaboration of multiple LLM agents, CLADD dynamically retrieves information from biomedical knowledge bases, contextualizes query molecules, and integrates relevant evidence to generate responses -- all without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. Crucially, we tackle key obstacles in applying RAG workflows to biochemical data, including data heterogeneity, ambiguity, and multi-source integration. We demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of this framework across a variety of drug discovery tasks, showing that it outperforms general-purpose and domain-specific LLMs as well as traditional deep learning approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Machi...</summary><p>Machine Learning, Drug Discovery</p></details> |

However, these modules are usually separately trained. We argue that a system like RAG that incorporates multiple modules should be jointly optimized to achieve optimal performance. To demonstrate this, we design a specific pipeline called \textbf{SmartRAG} that includes a policy network and a retriever. The policy network can serve as 1) a decision maker that decides when to retrieve, 2) a query rewriter to generate a query most suited to the retriever, and 3) an answer generator that produces the final response with/without the observations. We then propose to jointly optimize the whole system using a reinforcement learning algorithm, with the reward designed to encourage the system to achieve the best performance with minimal retrieval cost. When jointly optimized, all the modules can be aware of how other modules are working and thus find the best way to work together as a complete system. Empirical results demonstrate that the jointly optimized SmartRAG can achieve better performance than separately optimized counterparts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human Cognition Inspired RAG with Knowledge Graph for Complex Problem Solving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06567v1)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential across various domains, yet they face significant challenges in knowledge integration and complex problem reasoning, often leading to hallucinations and unreliable outputs. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution to enhance LLMs accuracy by incorporating external knowledge. However, traditional RAG systems struggle with processing complex relational information and multi-step reasoning, limiting their effectiveness in advanced problem-solving tasks. To address these limitations, we propose CogGRAG, a cognition inspired graph-based RAG framework, designed to improve LLMs performance in Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA). Inspired by the human cognitive process of decomposing complex problems and performing self-verification, our framework introduces a three-stage methodology: decomposition, retrieval, and reasoning with self-verification. By integrating these components, CogGRAG enhances the accuracy of LLMs in complex problem solving. We conduct systematic experiments with three LLM backbones on four benchmark datasets, where CogGRAG outperforms the baselines.</p></details> |  |

While RAG enhances MLLMs by grounding responses in query-relevant external knowledge, this reliance poses a critical yet underexplored safety risk: knowledge poisoning attacks, where misinformation or irrelevant knowledge is intentionally injected into external knowledge bases to manipulate model outputs to be incorrect and even harmful. To expose such vulnerabilities in multimodal RAG, we propose MM-PoisonRAG, a novel knowledge poisoning attack framework with two attack strategies: Localized Poisoning Attack (LPA), which injects query-specific misinformation in both text and images for targeted manipulation, and Globalized Poisoning Attack (GPA) to provide false guidance during MLLM generation to elicit nonsensical responses across all queries. We evaluate our attacks across multiple tasks, models, and access settings, demonstrating that LPA successfully manipulates the MLLM to generate attacker-controlled answers, with a success rate of up to 56% on MultiModalQA. Moreover, GPA completely disrupts model generation to 0% accuracy with just a single irrelevant knowledge injection. Our results highlight the urgent need for robust defenses against knowledge poisoning to safeguard multimodal RAG frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/HyeonjeongHa/MM-PoisonRAG</p></details> |

Built from heterologous data of NASDAQ 100 companies, FinTMMBench offers three significant advantages. 1) Multi-modal Corpus: It encompasses a hybrid of financial tables, news articles, daily stock prices, and visual technical charts as the corpus. 2) Temporal-aware Questions: Each question requires the retrieval and interpretation of its relevant data over a specific time period, including daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual periods. 3) Diverse Financial Analysis Tasks: The questions involve 10 different tasks, including information extraction, trend analysis, sentiment analysis and event detection, etc. We further propose a novel TMMHybridRAG method, which first leverages LLMs to convert data from other modalities (e.g., tabular, visual and time-series data) into textual format and then incorporates temporal information in each node when constructing graphs and dense indexes. Its effectiveness has been validated in extensive experiments, but notable gaps remain, highlighting the challenges presented by our FinTMMBench.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Beyond RAG: Task-Aware KV Cache Compression for Comprehensive Knowledge Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04973v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incorporating external knowledge in large language models (LLMs) enhances their utility across diverse applications, but existing methods have trade-offs. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) fetches evidence via similarity search, but key information may fall outside top ranked results. Long-context models can process multiple documents but are computationally expensive and limited by context window size. Inspired by students condensing study material for open-book exams, we propose task-aware key-value (KV) cache compression, which compresses external knowledge in a zero- or few-shot setup. This enables LLMs to reason efficiently over a compacted representation of all relevant information. Experiments show our approach outperforms both RAG and task-agnostic compression methods. On LongBench v2, it improves accuracy by up to 7 absolute points over RAG with a 30x compression rate, while reducing inference latency from 0.43s to 0.16s. A synthetic dataset highlights that RAG performs well when sparse evidence suffices, whereas task-aware compression is superior for broad knowledge tasks.</p></details> |  |

Predictive maintenance (PdM) in such settings demands methodologies that are adaptive, transferable, and capable of integrating domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we present RAAD-LLM, a novel framework for adaptive anomaly detection, leveraging large language models (LLMs) integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This approach addresses the aforementioned PdM challenges. By effectively utilizing domain-specific knowledge, RAAD-LLM enhances the detection of anomalies in time series data without requiring fine-tuning on specific datasets. The framework's adaptability mechanism enables it to adjust its understanding of normal operating conditions dynamically, thus increasing detection accuracy. We validate this methodology through a real-world application for a plastics manufacturing plant and the Skoltech Anomaly Benchmark (SKAB). Results show significant improvements over our previous model with an accuracy increase from 70.7% to 89.1% on the real-world dataset. By allowing for the enriching of input series data with semantics, RAAD-LLM incorporates multimodal capabilities that facilitate more collaborative decision-making between the model and plant operators. Overall, our findings support RAAD-LLM's ability to revolutionize anomaly detection methodologies in PdM, potentially leading to a paradigm shift in how anomaly detection is implemented across various industries.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2411.00914</p></details> |

Although previous studies noted that retrieving many documents can degrade performance, they did not isolate how the quantity of documents affects performance while controlling for context length. We evaluate various language models on custom datasets derived from a multi-hop QA task. We keep the context length and position of relevant information constant while varying the number of documents, and find that increasing the document count in RAG settings poses significant challenges for LLMs. Additionally, our results indicate that processing multiple documents is a separate challenge from handling long contexts. We also make the datasets and code available: https://github.com/shaharl6000/MoreDocsSameLen .</p></details> | Preprint |

A number of graph-based RAG methods have been proposed in the literature. However, these methods have not been systematically and comprehensively compared under the same experimental settings. In this paper, we first summarize a unified framework to incorporate all graph-based RAG methods from a high-level perspective. We then extensively compare representative graph-based RAG methods over a range of questing-answering (QA) datasets -- from specific questions to abstract questions -- and examine the effectiveness of all methods, providing a thorough analysis of graph-based RAG approaches. As a byproduct of our experimental analysis, we are also able to identify new variants of the graph-based RAG methods over specific QA and abstract QA tasks respectively, by combining existing techniques, which outperform the state-of-the-art methods. Finally, based on these findings, we offer promising research opportunities. We believe that a deeper understanding of the behavior of existing methods can provide new valuable insights for future research.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers an effective method for achieving this by retrieving the most relevant fragments into LLMs. However, the advancements in context window size for LLMs offer an alternative approach, raising the question of whether RAG remains necessary for effectively handling external knowledge. Several existing studies provide inconclusive comparisons between RAG and long-context (LC) LLMs, largely due to limitations in the benchmark designs. In this paper, we present LaRA, a novel benchmark specifically designed to rigorously compare RAG and LC LLMs. LaRA encompasses 2326 test cases across four practical QA task categories and three types of naturally occurring long texts. Through systematic evaluation of seven open-source and four proprietary LLMs, we find that the optimal choice between RAG and LC depends on a complex interplay of factors, including the model's parameter size, long-text capabilities, context length, task type, and the characteristics of the retrieved chunks. Our findings provide actionable guidelines for practitioners to effectively leverage both RAG and LC approaches in developing and deploying LLM applications.

While many studies focus on evaluating the overall quality of end-to-end RAG systems, there is a gap in understanding the appropriateness of LLMs for the RAG task. To address this, we introduce Trust-Score, a holistic metric that evaluates the trustworthiness of LLMs within the RAG framework. Our results show that various prompting methods, such as in-context learning, fail to effectively adapt LLMs to the RAG task as measured by Trust-Score. Consequently, we propose Trust-Align, a method to align LLMs for improved Trust-Score performance. 26 out of 27 models aligned using Trust-Align substantially outperform competitive baselines on ASQA, QAMPARI, and ELI5. Specifically, in LLaMA-3-8b, Trust-Align outperforms FRONT on ASQA (up 12.56), QAMPARI (up 36.04), and ELI5 (up 17.69). Trust-Align also significantly enhances models' ability to correctly refuse and provide quality citations. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of Trust-Align across different open-weight models, including the LLaMA series (1b to 8b), Qwen-2.5 series (0.5b to 7b), and Phi3.5 (3.8b). We release our code at https://github.com/declare-lab/trust-align.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |

However, evaluating the effectiveness of RAG systems in specialized scenarios remains challenging due to the high costs of data construction and the lack of suitable evaluation metrics. This paper introduces RAGEval, a framework designed to assess RAG systems across diverse scenarios by generating high-quality documents, questions, answers, and references through a schema-based pipeline. With a focus on factual accuracy, we propose three novel metrics: Completeness, Hallucination, and Irrelevance to evaluate LLM generated responses rigorously. Experimental results show that RAGEval outperforms zero-shot and one-shot methods in terms of clarity, safety, conformity, and richness of generated samples. Furthermore, the use of LLMs for scoring the proposed metrics demonstrates a high level of consistency with human evaluations. RAGEval establishes a new paradigm for evaluating RAG systems in real-world applications.

| **[SAGE: A Framework of Precise Retrieval for RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01713v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated significant proficiency in conducting question-answering (QA) tasks within a specified corpus. Nonetheless, numerous failure instances of RAG in QA still exist. These failures are not solely attributable to the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs); instead, they predominantly arise from the retrieval of inaccurate information for LLMs due to two limitations: (1) Current RAG methods segment the corpus without considering semantics, making it difficult to find relevant context due to impaired correlation between questions and the segments. (2) There is a trade-off between missing essential context with fewer context retrieved and getting irrelevant context with more context retrieved. In this paper, we introduce a RAG framework (SAGE), to overcome these limitations. First, to address the segmentation issue without considering semantics, we propose to train a semantic segmentation model. This model is trained to segment the corpus into semantically complete chunks. Second, to ensure that only the most relevant chunks are retrieved while the irrelevant ones are ignored, we design a chunk selection algorithm to dynamically select chunks based on the decreasing speed of the relevance score, leading to a more relevant selection. Third, to further ensure the precision of the retrieved chunks, we propose letting LLMs assess whether retrieved chunks are excessive or lacking and then adjust the amount of context accordingly. Experiments show that SAGE outperforms baselines by 61.25% in the quality of QA on average. Moreover, by avoiding retrieving noisy context, SAGE lowers the cost of the tokens consumed in LLM inference and achieves a 49.41% enhancement in cost efficiency on average. Additionally, our work offers valuable insights for boosting RAG.</p></details> |  |

To overcome the limitations of existing methods, this paper shifts away from prior dedicated heuristic approaches and revisits the most fundamental idea to HR perception by enhancing the long-context capability of MLLMs, driven by recent advances in long-context techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for general LLMs. Towards this end, this paper presents the first study exploring the use of RAG to address HR perception challenges. Specifically, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Perception (RAP), a training-free framework that retrieves and fuses relevant image crops while preserving spatial context using the proposed Spatial-Awareness Layout. To accommodate different tasks, the proposed Retrieved-Exploration Search (RE-Search) dynamically selects the optimal number of crops based on model confidence and retrieval scores. Experimental results on HR benchmarks demonstrate the significant effectiveness of RAP, with LLaVA-v1.5-13B achieving a 43% improvement on $V^*$ Bench and 19% on HR-Bench.</p></details> |  |

Recent progress in Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) has opened up new possibilities for interactive diagnostic tools. However, these models often suffer from factual hallucination, which can lead to incorrect diagnoses. Fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have emerged as methods to address these issues. However, the amount of high-quality data and distribution shifts between training data and deployment data limit the application of fine-tuning methods. Although RAG is lightweight and effective, existing RAG-based approaches are not sufficiently general to different medical domains and can potentially cause misalignment issues, both between modalities and between the model and the ground truth. In this paper, we propose a versatile multimodal RAG system, MMed-RAG, designed to enhance the factuality of Med-LVLMs. Our approach introduces a domain-aware retrieval mechanism, an adaptive retrieved contexts selection method, and a provable RAG-based preference fine-tuning strategy. These innovations make the RAG process sufficiently general and reliable, significantly improving alignment when introducing retrieved contexts. Experimental results across five medical datasets (involving radiology, ophthalmology, pathology) on medical VQA and report generation demonstrate that MMed-RAG can achieve an average improvement of 43.8% in the factual accuracy of Med-LVLMs. Our data and code are available in https://github.com/richard-peng-xia/MMed-RAG.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

In this paper, we propose a generative AI-powered GATE question-answering framework (GATE stands for Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering) that leverages LLMs to explain GATE solutions and support students in their exam preparation. We conducted extensive benchmarking to select the optimal embedding model and LLM, evaluating our framework based on criteria such as latency, faithfulness, and relevance, with additional validation through human evaluation. Our chatbot integrates state-of-the-art embedding models and LLMs to deliver accurate, context-aware responses. Through rigorous experimentation, we identified configurations that balance performance and computational efficiency, ensuring a reliable chatbot to serve students' needs. Additionally, we discuss the challenges faced in data processing and modeling and implemented solutions. Our work explores the application of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for GATE Q/A explanation tasks, and our findings demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and response quality.

| **[Post-training an LLM for RAG? Train on Self-Generated Demonstrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10596v2)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with knowledge intensive NLP tasks, such as answering "Who won the latest World Cup?" because the knowledge they learn during training may be insufficient or outdated. Conditioning generation on retrieved documents -- a technique known as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) -- mitigates these shortcomings by allowing the model to leverage in-context information. Practitioners can improve LLM RAG performance by fine-tuning on retrieval-augmented instructions, but must beware that this can cause undesirable model behaviors like hallucinations. We attribute this degradation to the fact that the training data is likely to be out-of-distribution for the model and may suffer from quality issues, such as misalignment between retrievals and target responses (since retrievals are frequently added post-hoc). We propose a recipe for training RAG-enabled LLMs using self-generated demonstrations, thereby avoiding training on out-of-distribution text and integrating retrievals into the LLM responses. We evaluate our method on knowledge intensive question answering (QA) tasks and show that our method teaches LLMs to properly handle in-context retrievals and abstain from questions it will likely get wrong. Compared to conventional RA-IT methods, our method prevents model degradation in non-RAG settings while exhibiting superior QA performance.</p></details> |  |

To address the fragmented evaluation paradigms and limited cases in existing Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH), this paper introduces U-NIAH, a unified framework that systematically compares LLMs and RAG methods in controlled long context settings. Our framework extends beyond traditional NIAH by incorporating multi-needle, long-needle, and needle-in-needle configurations, along with different retrieval settings, while leveraging the synthetic Starlight Academy dataset-a fictional magical universe-to eliminate biases from pre-trained knowledge. Through extensive experiments, we investigate three research questions: (1) performance trade-offs between LLMs and RAG, (2) error patterns in RAG, and (3) RAG's limitations in complex settings. Our findings show that RAG significantly enhances smaller LLMs by mitigating the "lost-in-the-middle" effect and improving robustness, achieving an 82.58% win-rate over LLMs. However, we observe that retrieval noise and reverse chunk ordering degrade performance, while surprisingly, advanced reasoning LLMs exhibit reduced RAG compatibility due to sensitivity to semantic distractors. We identify typical error patterns including omission due to noise, hallucination under high noise critical condition, and self-doubt behaviors. Our work not only highlights the complementary roles of RAG and LLMs, but also provides actionable insights for optimizing deployments.

However, these models face challenges in retrieving precise information from vast datasets. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) was developed to combining LLMs with external information retrieval systems to enhance the accuracy and context of responses. Despite improvements, RAG still struggles with comprehensive retrieval in high-volume, low-information-density databases and lacks relational awareness, leading to fragmented answers. To address this, this paper introduces the Pseudo-Knowledge Graph (PKG) framework, designed to overcome these limitations by integrating Meta-path Retrieval, In-graph Text and Vector Retrieval into LLMs. By preserving natural language text and leveraging various retrieval techniques, the PKG offers a richer knowledge representation and improves accuracy in information retrieval. Extensive evaluations using Open Compass and MultiHop-RAG benchmarks demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in managing large volumes of data and complex relationships.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods rely on unrealistic white-box assumptions, such as attackers having access to RAG systems' internal processes. To address this issue, we introduce a realistic black-box attack scenario based on the RAG paradox, where RAG systems inadvertently expose vulnerabilities while attempting to enhance trustworthiness. Because RAG systems reference external documents during response generation, our attack targets these sources without requiring internal access. Our approach first identifies the external sources disclosed by RAG systems and then automatically generates poisoned documents with misinformation designed to match these sources. Finally, these poisoned documents are newly published on the disclosed sources, disrupting the RAG system's response generation process. Both offline and online experiments confirm that this attack significantly reduces RAG performance without requiring internal access. Furthermore, from an insider perspective within the RAG system, we propose a re-ranking method that acts as a fundamental safeguard, offering minimal protection against unforeseen attacks.</p></details> |  |

Different from traditional RAG methods that mostly deal with flat text chunks, the proposed method takes into account the relationship of multimodalities by using a graph structure. To do that, a graph modeling structure is defined based on document layout parsing. The structure of an input document is retained with the connection of text chunks, tables, and figures. This representation allows the method to handle complex questions that require information from multimodalities. To confirm the efficiency of the graph modeling, a flexible RAG pipeline is developed using robust components. Experimental results on four benchmark test sets confirm the contribution of the layout-aware modeling for performance improvement of the RAG pipeline.</p></details> | <details><summary>NAACL...</summary><p>NAACL 2025, Industry Track</p></details> |

Recent RAG advancements focus on improving retrieval outcomes through iterative LLM refinement or self-critique capabilities acquired through additional instruction tuning of LLMs. In this work, we introduce Speculative RAG - a framework that leverages a larger generalist LM to efficiently verify multiple RAG drafts produced in parallel by a smaller, distilled specialist LM. Each draft is generated from a distinct subset of retrieved documents, offering diverse perspectives on the evidence while reducing input token counts per draft. This approach enhances comprehension of each subset and mitigates potential position bias over long context. Our method accelerates RAG by delegating drafting to the smaller specialist LM, with the larger generalist LM performing a single verification pass over the drafts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Speculative RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance with reduced latency on TriviaQA, MuSiQue, PopQA, PubHealth, and ARC-Challenge benchmarks. It notably enhances accuracy by up to 12.97% while reducing latency by 50.83% compared to conventional RAG systems on PubHealth.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[OntologyRAG: Better and Faster Biomedical Code Mapping with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Leveraging Ontology Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18992v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biomedical ontologies, which comprehensively define concepts and relations for biomedical entities, are crucial for structuring and formalizing domain-specific information representations. Biomedical code mapping identifies similarity or equivalence between concepts from different ontologies. Obtaining high-quality mapping usually relies on automatic generation of unrefined mapping with ontology domain fine-tuned language models (LMs), followed by manual selections or corrections by coding experts who have extensive domain expertise and familiarity with ontology schemas. The LMs usually provide unrefined code mapping suggestions as a list of candidates without reasoning or supporting evidence, hence coding experts still need to verify each suggested candidate against ontology sources to pick the best matches. This is also a recurring task as ontology sources are updated regularly to incorporate new research findings. Consequently, the need of regular LM retraining and manual refinement make code mapping time-consuming and labour intensive. In this work, we created OntologyRAG, an ontology-enhanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method that leverages the inductive biases from ontological knowledge graphs for in-context-learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs). Our solution grounds LLMs to knowledge graphs with unrefined mappings between ontologies and processes questions by generating an interpretable set of results that include prediction rational with mapping proximity assessment. Our solution doesn't require re-training LMs, as all ontology updates could be reflected by updating the knowledge graphs with a standard process. Evaluation results on a self-curated gold dataset show promises of using our method to enable coding experts to achieve better and faster code mapping. The code is available at https://github.com/iqvianlp/ontologyRAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted as a workshop paper for KEIR@ECIR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Faster, Cheaper, Better: Multi-Objective Hyperparameter Optimization for LLM and RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18635v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a popular technique for improving Large Language Model (LLM) systems, it introduces a large number of choices, parameters and hyperparameters that must be made or tuned. This includes the LLM, embedding, and ranker models themselves, as well as hyperparameters governing individual RAG components. Yet, collectively optimizing the entire configuration in a RAG or LLM system remains under-explored - especially in multi-objective settings - due to intractably large solution spaces, noisy objective evaluations, and the high cost of evaluations. In this work, we introduce the first approach for multi-objective parameter optimization of cost, latency, safety and alignment over entire LLM and RAG systems. We find that Bayesian optimization methods significantly outperform baseline approaches, obtaining a superior Pareto front on two new RAG benchmark tasks. We conclude our work with important considerations for practitioners who are designing multi-objective RAG systems, highlighting nuances such as how optimal configurations may not generalize across tasks and objectives.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ward: Provable RAG Dataset Inference via LLM Watermarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03537v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RAG enables LLMs to easily incorporate external data, raising concerns for data owners regarding unauthorized usage of their content. The challenge of detecting such unauthorized usage remains underexplored, with datasets and methods from adjacent fields being ill-suited for its study. We take several steps to bridge this gap. First, we formalize this problem as (black-box) RAG Dataset Inference (RAG-DI). We then introduce a novel dataset designed for realistic benchmarking of RAG-DI methods, alongside a set of baselines. Finally, we propose Ward, a method for RAG-DI based on LLM watermarks that equips data owners with rigorous statistical guarantees regarding their dataset's misuse in RAG corpora. Ward consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving higher accuracy, superior query efficiency and robustness. Our work provides a foundation for future studies of RAG-DI and highlights LLM watermarks as a promising approach to this problem.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[Towards Fair RAG: On the Impact of Fair Ranking in Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11598v3)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern language models frequently include retrieval components to improve their outputs, giving rise to a growing number of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. Yet, most existing work in RAG has underemphasized fair ranking techniques and neglected the diverse interests of all stakeholders. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of RAG systems that incorporate fairness-aware rankings, focusing on both ranking fairness and attribution fairness - ensuring equitable exposure of sources cited in the final text. We specifically examine item-side fairness, i.e., whether retrieved documents receive balanced exposure, and assess how this affects both the system's overall performance and the eventual distribution of cited sources. Across twelve RAG models and seven tasks, we find that fairness-aware retrieval frequently retains or even improves ranking effectiveness and generation quality, countering the widespread belief that fairness compromises system performance. Moreover, we show that fair retrieval leads to more balanced attribution in the final responses, ensuring that the cited sources are credited more equitably. Our results underscore the importance of item-side fairness throughout both retrieval and generation phases, offering key insights for building more responsible and equitable RAG systems and illustrating promising avenues for future exploration in fair ranking and source attribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Top 5...</summary><p>Top 5 Spotlight at AFME Workshop at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating the Effectiveness and Efficiency of Demonstration Retrievers in RAG for Coding Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09662v2)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge bases, achieving state-of-the-art results in various coding tasks. The core of RAG is retrieving demonstration examples, which is essential to balance effectiveness (generation quality) and efficiency (retrieval time) for optimal performance. However, the high-dimensional nature of code representations and large knowledge bases often create efficiency bottlenecks, which are overlooked in previous research. This paper systematically evaluates the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off of retrievers across three coding tasks: Program Synthesis, Commit Message Generation, and Assertion Generation. We examined six retrievers: two sparse (BM25 and BM25L) and four dense retrievers, including one exhaustive dense retriever (SBERT's Semantic Search) and three approximate dense retrievers (ANNOY, LSH, and HNSW). Our findings show that while BM25 excels in effectiveness, it suffers in efficiency as the knowledge base grows beyond 1000 entries. In large-scale retrieval, efficiency differences become more pronounced, with approximate dense retrievers offering the greatest gains. For instance, in Commit Generation task, HNSW achieves a 44x speed up, while only with a 1.74% drop in RougeL compared with BM25. Our results also show that increasing the number of demonstrations in the prompt doesn't always improve the effectiveness and can increase latency and lead to incorrect outputs. Our findings provide valuable insights for practitioners aiming to build efficient and effective RAG systems for coding tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables, accepted by SANER 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we study the conflict between biases of each component and their relationship to the overall bias of the RAG system, which we call bias conflict. Examining both gender and political biases as case studies, we show that bias conflict can be characterized through a linear relationship among components despite its complexity in 6 different LLMs. Through comprehensive fine-tuning experiments creating 120 differently biased embedders, we demonstrate how to control bias while maintaining utility and reveal the importance of reverse-biasing the embedder to mitigate bias in the overall system. Additionally, we find that LLMs and tasks exhibit varying sensitivities to the embedder bias, a crucial factor to consider for debiasing. Our results underscore that a fair RAG system can be better achieved by carefully controlling the bias of the embedder rather than increasing its fairness.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages (8 main), 12 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

We present LettuceDetect a framework that addresses two critical limitations in existing hallucination detection methods: (1) the context window constraints of traditional encoder-based methods, and (2) the computational inefficiency of LLM based approaches. Building on ModernBERT's extended context capabilities (up to 8k tokens) and trained on the RAGTruth benchmark dataset, our approach outperforms all previous encoder-based models and most prompt-based models, while being approximately 30 times smaller than the best models. LettuceDetect is a token-classification model that processes context-question-answer triples, allowing for the identification of unsupported claims at the token level. Evaluations on the RAGTruth corpus demonstrate an F1 score of 79.22% for example-level detection, which is a 14.8% improvement over Luna, the previous state-of-the-art encoder-based architecture. Additionally, the system can process 30 to 60 examples per second on a single GPU, making it more practical for real-world RAG applications.</p></details> | 6 pages |
| **[Don't Do RAG: When Cache-Augmented Generation is All You Need for Knowledge Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15605v2)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has gained traction as a powerful approach for enhancing language models by integrating external knowledge sources. However, RAG introduces challenges such as retrieval latency, potential errors in document selection, and increased system complexity. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) featuring significantly extended context windows, this paper proposes an alternative paradigm, cache-augmented generation (CAG) that bypasses real-time retrieval. Our method involves preloading all relevant resources, especially when the documents or knowledge for retrieval are of a limited and manageable size, into the LLM's extended context and caching its runtime parameters. During inference, the model utilizes these preloaded parameters to answer queries without additional retrieval steps. Comparative analyses reveal that CAG eliminates retrieval latency and minimizes retrieval errors while maintaining context relevance. Performance evaluations across multiple benchmarks highlight scenarios where long-context LLMs either outperform or complement traditional RAG pipelines. These findings suggest that, for certain applications, particularly those with a constrained knowledge base, CAG provide a streamlined and efficient alternative to RAG, achieving comparable or superior results with reduced complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, accepted by the Web Conference 2025 (WWW '25) as a short paper</p></details> |
| **[Worse than Zero-shot? A Fact-Checking Dataset for Evaluating the Robustness of RAG Against Misleading Retrievals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16101v1)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has shown impressive capabilities in mitigating hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs struggle to handle misleading retrievals and often fail to maintain their own reasoning when exposed to conflicting or selectively-framed evidence, making them vulnerable to real-world misinformation. In such real-world retrieval scenarios, misleading and conflicting information is rampant, particularly in the political domain, where evidence is often selectively framed, incomplete, or polarized. However, existing RAG benchmarks largely assume a clean retrieval setting, where models succeed by accurately retrieving and generating answers from gold-standard documents. This assumption fails to align with real-world conditions, leading to an overestimation of RAG system performance. To bridge this gap, we introduce RAGuard, a fact-checking dataset designed to evaluate the robustness of RAG systems against misleading retrievals. Unlike prior benchmarks that rely on synthetic noise, our dataset constructs its retrieval corpus from Reddit discussions, capturing naturally occurring misinformation. It categorizes retrieved evidence into three types: supporting, misleading, and irrelevant, providing a realistic and challenging testbed for assessing how well RAG systems navigate different retrieval information. Our benchmark experiments reveal that when exposed to misleading retrievals, all tested LLM-powered RAG systems perform worse than their zero-shot baselines (i.e., no retrieval at all), highlighting their susceptibility to noisy environments. To the best of our knowledge, RAGuard is the first benchmark to systematically assess RAG robustness against misleading evidence. We expect this benchmark will drive future research toward improving RAG systems beyond idealized datasets, making them more reliable for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

However, due to access restrictions, Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot retrieve these internal documents, limiting their ability to generate accurate zero-shot responses. To overcome this limitation, we use a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework powered by a Knowledge Graph (KG) to retrieve relevant information from external knowledge sources, enabling LLMs to answer questions over private or previously unseen document collections. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for building a high-quality, low-noise KG. We apply several techniques, including incremental entity resolution using seed concepts, similarity-based filtering to deduplicate entries, assigning confidence scores to entity-relation pairs to filter for high-confidence pairs, and linking facts to source documents for provenance. Our KG-RAG system retrieves relevant tuples, which are added to the user prompts context before being sent to the LLM generating the response. Our evaluation demonstrates that this approach significantly enhances response relevance, reducing irrelevant answers by over 50% and increasing fully relevant answers by 88% compared to the existing production system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain-of-Rank: Enhancing Large Language Models for Domain-Specific RAG in Edge Device](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15134v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) is especially valuable in specialized domains, where precision is critical. To more specialize the LLMs into a target domain, domain-specific RAG has recently been developed by allowing the LLM to access the target domain early via finetuning. The domain-specific RAG makes more sense in resource-constrained environments like edge devices, as they should perform a specific task (e.g. personalization) reliably using only small-scale LLMs. While the domain-specific RAG is well-aligned with edge devices in this respect, it often relies on widely-used reasoning techniques like chain-of-thought (CoT). The reasoning step is useful to understand the given external knowledge, and yet it is computationally expensive and difficult for small-scale LLMs to learn it. Tackling this, we propose the Chain of Rank (CoR) which shifts the focus from intricate lengthy reasoning to simple ranking of the reliability of input external documents. Then, CoR reduces computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy, making it particularly suited for resource-constrained environments. We attain the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in benchmarks, and analyze its efficacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>NAACL...</summary><p>NAACL 2025 (Findings)</p></details> |

Different from a standard retrieval task's objective of maximising the relevance of a set of top-ranked documents, a RAG system's objective is rather to maximise their total utility, where the utility of a document indicates whether including it as a part of the additional contextual information in an LLM prompt improves a downstream task. Existing studies investigate the role of the relevance of a RAG context for knowledge-intensive language tasks (KILT), where relevance essentially takes the form of answer containment. In contrast, in our work, relevance corresponds to that of topical overlap between a query and a document for an information seeking task. Specifically, we make use of an IR test collection to empirically investigate whether a RAG context comprised of topically relevant documents leads to improved downstream performance. Our experiments lead to the following findings: (a) there is a small positive correlation between relevance and utility; (b) this correlation decreases with increasing context sizes (higher values of k in k-shot); and (c) a more effective retrieval model generally leads to better downstream RAG performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages (including reference), 5 figures, 1 table, 48 references; this paper has been accepted by ECIR'25 as a full paper</p></details> |

Our approach combines RAG with Socratic dialogue to align a user's intuitive understanding of research topics with established Knowledge Organization Systems (KOSs). The proposed approach will effectively bridge "little semantics" (domain-specific KOS structures) with "big semantics" (broad bibliometric repositories), making complex academic taxonomies more accessible. Such agents have the potential for broad use. We illustrate with a sample application called CollabNext, which is a person-centric knowledge graph connecting people, organizations, and research topics. We further describe how the application design has an intentional focus on HBCUs and emerging researchers to raise visibility of people historically rendered invisible in the current science system.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, AAAI 2025 Workshop on A Translational Institute for Knowledge Axiomatization</p></details> |

Given the challenges in continual learning with large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become the dominant way to introduce new information. However, its reliance on vector retrieval hinders its ability to mimic the dynamic and interconnected nature of human long-term memory. Recent RAG approaches augment vector embeddings with various structures like knowledge graphs to address some of these gaps, namely sense-making and associativity. However, their performance on more basic factual memory tasks drops considerably below standard RAG. We address this unintended deterioration and propose HippoRAG 2, a framework that outperforms standard RAG comprehensively on factual, sense-making, and associative memory tasks. HippoRAG 2 builds upon the Personalized PageRank algorithm used in HippoRAG and enhances it with deeper passage integration and more effective online use of an LLM. This combination pushes this RAG system closer to the effectiveness of human long-term memory, achieving a 7% improvement in associative memory tasks over the state-of-the-art embedding model while also exhibiting superior factual knowledge and sense-making memory capabilities. This work paves the way for non-parametric continual learning for LLMs. Our code and data will be released at https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/HippoRAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data to be released at: https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/HippoRAG</p></details> |

However, when the retrieval process involves private data, RAG systems may face severe privacy risks, potentially leading to the leakage of sensitive information. To address this issue, we propose using synthetic data as a privacy-preserving alternative for the retrieval data. We propose SAGE, a novel two-stage synthetic data generation paradigm. In the stage-1, we employ an attribute-based extraction and generation approach to preserve key contextual information from the original data. In the stage-2, we further enhance the privacy properties of the synthetic data through an agent-based iterative refinement process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that using our synthetic data as the retrieval context achieves comparable performance to using the original data while substantially reducing privacy risks. Our work takes the first step towards investigating the possibility of generating high-utility and privacy-preserving synthetic data for RAG, opening up new opportunities for the safe application of RAG systems in various domains.</p></details> |  |

This is critical given existing workforce shortages, especially in marginalized communities like Underrepresented Minorities (URM), who often lack access to quality education. Addressing these challenges, this research presents gAI-PT4I4, a Generative AI-based Personalized Tutor for Industrial 4.0, designed to personalize 4IR experiential learning. gAI-PT4I4 employs sentiment analysis to assess student comprehension, leveraging generative AI and finite automaton to tailor learning experiences. The framework integrates low-fidelity Digital Twins for VR-based training, featuring an Interactive Tutor - a generative AI assistant providing real-time guidance via audio and text. It uses zero-shot sentiment analysis with LLMs and prompt engineering, achieving 86\% accuracy in classifying student-teacher interactions as positive or negative. Additionally, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables personalized learning content grounded in domain-specific knowledge. To adapt training dynamically, finite automaton structures exercises into states of increasing difficulty, requiring 80\% task-performance accuracy for progression. Experimental evaluation with 22 volunteers showed improved accuracy exceeding 80\%, reducing training time. Finally, this paper introduces a Multi-Fidelity Digital Twin model, aligning Digital Twin complexity with Bloom's Taxonomy and Kirkpatrick's model, providing a scalable educational framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Local to Global: A Graph RAG Approach to Query-Focused Summarization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16130v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to retrieve relevant information from an external knowledge source enables large language models (LLMs) to answer questions over private and/or previously unseen document collections. However, RAG fails on global questions directed at an entire text corpus, such as "What are the main themes in the dataset?", since this is inherently a query-focused summarization (QFS) task, rather than an explicit retrieval task. Prior QFS methods, meanwhile, do not scale to the quantities of text indexed by typical RAG systems. To combine the strengths of these contrasting methods, we propose GraphRAG, a graph-based approach to question answering over private text corpora that scales with both the generality of user questions and the quantity of source text. Our approach uses an LLM to build a graph index in two stages: first, to derive an entity knowledge graph from the source documents, then to pregenerate community summaries for all groups of closely related entities. Given a question, each community summary is used to generate a partial response, before all partial responses are again summarized in a final response to the user. For a class of global sensemaking questions over datasets in the 1 million token range, we show that GraphRAG leads to substantial improvements over a conventional RAG baseline for both the comprehensiveness and diversity of generated answers.</p></details> |  |

To comprehensively evaluate the resilience of current RAG methods, we introduce HawkBench, a human-labeled, multi-domain benchmark designed to rigorously assess RAG performance across categorized task types. By stratifying tasks based on information-seeking behaviors, HawkBench provides a systematic evaluation of how well RAG systems adapt to diverse user needs. Unlike existing benchmarks, which focus primarily on specific task types (mostly factoid queries) and rely on varying knowledge bases, HawkBench offers: (1) systematic task stratification to cover a broad range of query types, including both factoid and rationale queries, (2) integration of multi-domain corpora across all task types to mitigate corpus bias, and (3) rigorous annotation for high-quality evaluation. HawkBench includes 1,600 high-quality test samples, evenly distributed across domains and task types. Using this benchmark, we evaluate representative RAG methods, analyzing their performance in terms of answer quality and response latency. Our findings highlight the need for dynamic task strategies that integrate decision-making, query interpretation, and global knowledge understanding to improve RAG generalizability. We believe HawkBench serves as a pivotal benchmark for advancing the resilience of RAG methods and their ability to achieve general-purpose information seeking.</p></details> | 13 pages |

It has been shown to enhance both generation quality and trustworthiness. While numerous works have focused on improving retrieval, generation, and evaluation, the role of reward models in reinforcement learning for optimizing RAG remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{RAG-Reward}, a framework designed to develop reward models to enable \textit{hallucination-free, comprehensive, reliable, and efficient RAG}. We define four key metrics to assess generation quality and develop an automated benchmarking pipeline to evaluate the outputs of multiple LLMs across a variety of RAG scenarios. Using \textbf{RAG-Reward}, we train reward models and apply {reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF)} to improve LLMs' effectiveness in RAG. Experimental results demonstrate that our reward model achieves state-of-the-art performance in automatic benchmarking and aligns closely with human evaluations. Furthermore, the improved generation quality of the trained policy model highlights the feasibility and efficiency of using RLHF to enhance RAG outputs.</p></details> | Preprint |

In this paper, we introduce an omnidirectional and automatic RAG benchmark, OmniEval, in the financial domain. Our benchmark is characterized by its multi-dimensional evaluation framework, including (1) a matrix-based RAG scenario evaluation system that categorizes queries into five task classes and 16 financial topics, leading to a structured assessment of diverse query scenarios; (2) a multi-dimensional evaluation data generation approach, which combines GPT-4-based automatic generation and human annotation, achieving an 87.47\% acceptance ratio in human evaluations on generated instances; (3) a multi-stage evaluation system that evaluates both retrieval and generation performance, result in a comprehensive evaluation on the RAG pipeline; and (4) robust evaluation metrics derived from rule-based and LLM-based ones, enhancing the reliability of assessments through manual annotations and supervised fine-tuning of an LLM evaluator. Our experiments demonstrate the comprehensiveness of OmniEval, which includes extensive test datasets and highlights the performance variations of RAG systems across diverse topics and tasks, revealing significant opportunities for RAG models to improve their capabilities in vertical domains. We open source the code of our benchmark in \href{https://github.com/RUC-NLPIR/OmniEval}{https://github.com/RUC-NLPIR/OmniEval}.</p></details> |  |

While RAG enhances response relevance by incorporating retrieved domain knowledge in the context, retrieval errors can still lead to hallucinations and incorrect answers. To recover from retriever failures, domain knowledge is injected by fine-tuning the model to generate the correct response, even in the case of retrieval errors. However, we observe that without systematic knowledge augmentation, fine-tuned LLMs may memorize new information but still fail to extract relevant domain knowledge, leading to poor performance. In this work, we present a novel framework that significantly enhances the fine-tuning process by augmenting the training data in two ways -- context augmentation and knowledge paraphrasing. In context augmentation, we create multiple training samples for a given QA pair by varying the relevance of the retrieved information, teaching the model when to ignore and when to rely on retrieved content. In knowledge paraphrasing, we fine-tune with multiple answers to the same question, enabling LLMs to better internalize specialized knowledge. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting due to fine-tuning, we add a domain-specific identifier to a question and also utilize a replay buffer containing general QA pairs. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our method over existing techniques, achieving up to 10\% relative gain in token-level recall while preserving the LLM's generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 14 tables, to be published in NAACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[Does RAG Really Perform Bad For Long-Context Processing?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11444v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The efficient processing of long context poses a serious challenge for large language models (LLMs). Recently, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising strategy for this problem, as it enables LLMs to make selective use of the long context for efficient computation. However, existing RAG approaches lag behind other long-context processing methods due to inherent limitations on inaccurate retrieval and fragmented contexts. To address these challenges, we introduce RetroLM, a novel RAG framework for long-context processing. Unlike traditional methods, RetroLM employs KV-level retrieval augmentation, where it partitions the LLM's KV cache into contiguous pages and retrieves the most crucial ones for efficient computation. This approach enhances robustness to retrieval inaccuracy, facilitates effective utilization of fragmented contexts, and saves the cost from repeated computation. Building on this framework, we further develop a specialized retriever for precise retrieval of critical pages and conduct unsupervised post-training to optimize the model's ability to leverage retrieved information. We conduct comprehensive evaluations with a variety of benchmarks, including LongBench, InfiniteBench, and RULER, where RetroLM significantly outperforms existing long-context LLMs and efficient long-context processing methods, particularly in tasks requiring intensive reasoning or extremely long-context comprehension.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Robust RAG: Do We Still Need Complex Robust Training in the Era of Powerful LLMs?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11400v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems often suffer from performance degradation when encountering noisy or irrelevant documents, driving researchers to develop sophisticated training strategies to enhance their robustness against such retrieval noise. However, as large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the necessity of these complex training methods is increasingly questioned. In this paper, we systematically investigate whether complex robust training strategies remain necessary as model capacity grows. Through comprehensive experiments spanning multiple model architectures and parameter scales, we evaluate various document selection methods and adversarial training techniques across diverse datasets. Our extensive experiments consistently demonstrate that as models become more powerful, the performance gains brought by complex robust training methods drop off dramatically. We delve into the rationale and find that more powerful models inherently exhibit superior confidence calibration, better generalization across datasets (even when trained with randomly selected documents), and optimal attention mechanisms learned with simpler strategies. Our findings suggest that RAG systems can benefit from simpler architectures and training strategies as models become more powerful, enabling more scalable applications with minimal complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[FunnelRAG: A Coarse-to-Fine Progressive Retrieval Paradigm for RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10293v3)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) prevails in Large Language Models. It mainly consists of retrieval and generation. The retrieval modules (a.k.a. retrievers) aim to find useful information used to facilitate the generation modules (a.k.a. generators). As such, generators' performance largely depends on the effectiveness and efficiency of retrievers. However, the widely used retrieval paradigm remains flat. It treats retrieval procedures as a one-off deal with constant granularity. Despite effectiveness, we argue that they suffer from two limitations: (1) flat retrieval exerts a significant burden on one retriever; (2) constant granularity limits the ceiling of retrieval performance. In this work, we propose a progressive retrieval paradigm with coarse-to-fine granularity for RAG, termed FunnelRAG, so as to balance effectiveness and efficiency. Specifically, FunnelRAG establishes a progressive retrieval pipeline by collaborating coarse-to-fine granularity, large-to-small quantity, and low-to-high capacity, which can relieve the burden on one retriever and also promote the ceiling of retrieval performance. Extensive experiments manifest that FunnelRAG achieves comparable retrieval performance while the time overhead is reduced by nearly 40 percent.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures, 13 tables.

For structured data, such as knowledge graphs, GraphRAG has been widely used to retrieve relevant information. However, recent studies have revealed that structuring implicit knowledge from text into graphs can benefit certain tasks, extending the application of GraphRAG from graph data to general text-based data. Despite their successful extensions, most applications of GraphRAG for text data have been designed for specific tasks and datasets, lacking a systematic evaluation and comparison between RAG and GraphRAG on widely used text-based benchmarks. In this paper, we systematically evaluate RAG and GraphRAG on well-established benchmark tasks, such as Question Answering and Query-based Summarization. Our results highlight the distinct strengths of RAG and GraphRAG across different tasks and evaluation perspectives. Inspired by these observations, we investigate strategies to integrate their strengths to improve downstream tasks. Additionally, we provide an in-depth discussion of the shortcomings of current GraphRAG approaches and outline directions for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating Language Preference of Multilingual RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11175v1)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) systems enhance language models by integrating external multilingual information to produce context-aware responses. However, mRAG systems struggle with retrieving relevant information due to linguistic variations between queries and documents, generating inconsistent responses when multilingual sources conflict. In this work, we systematically investigate language preferences in both retrieval and generation of mRAG through a series of experiments. Our analysis indicates that retrievers tend to prefer high-resource and query languages, yet this preference does not consistently improve generation performance. Moreover, we observe that generators prefer the query language or Latin scripts, leading to inconsistent outputs. To overcome these issues, we propose Dual Knowledge Multilingual RAG (DKM-RAG), a simple yet effective framework that fuses translated multilingual passages with complementary model knowledge. Empirical results demonstrate that DKM-RAG mitigates language preference in generation and enhances performance across diverse linguistic settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 16 tables, 14 figures</p></details> |

These two capabilities are complementary to each other and essential for LLMs to process large volumes of information that cannot fit into a single prompt. We present a detailed continued training recipe to extend the context window of Llama3-70B-base from 8K to 128K tokens, along with a three-stage instruction tuning process to enhance the model's instruction-following, RAG performance, and long-context understanding capabilities. Our results demonstrate that the Llama3-ChatQA-2-70B model outperforms most existing state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4-Turbo-2024-04-09, Qwen2-72B-Instruct, and Llama3.1-70B-Instruct, on ultra-long tasks beyond 100K tokens, as well as on the RAG benchmark using only a 4K context window, showing the strong long context capability across varying sequence lengths. We further provide extensive comparisons between direct long-context and RAG solutions using the same state-of-the-art long-context LLMs. Interestingly, we find that the performance of strong long-context LLMs using RAG improves when retrieving a larger number of chunks. With a large set of top-k chunks, RAG consistently outperforms direct long-context solution using the same state-of-the-art long-context models (e.g., Llama3-ChatQA-2-70B and Qwen2-72B-Instruct) on both 32K and 128K benchmarks.

| **[Hallucinations and Truth: A Comprehensive Accuracy Evaluation of RAG, LoRA and DoRA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10497v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Generative AI have significantly improved the efficiency and adaptability of natural language processing (NLP) systems, particularly through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA). RAG integrates external knowledge to enhance factual consistency in generative outputs, while LoRA enables parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). DoRA further refines this process by optimizing fine-tuning through adaptive parameter ranking and domain-aware weight adjustments, improving learning efficiency while maintaining inference performance. This paper presents a large-scale empirical evaluation of RAG, LoRA, and DoRA, with model fine-tuning and generation performance assessed on 20,000 FAQ-based queries, while the knowledge base spans 400,000 entries. The study analyzes key performance metrics such as accuracy, relevance, and inference latency. Experimental results demonstrate that DoRA achieves the highest accuracy (90.1%), relevance score (0.88), and lowest latency (110 ms per query), outperforming both LoRA and RAG in real-world, domain-specific generative AI applications. Furthermore, this study examines the trade-offs between fine-tuning efficiency, computational cost, and real-time adaptability across different models. Findings highlight RAG's effectiveness in knowledge grounding, LoRA's cost-efficient domain adaptation, and DoRA's ability to balance fine-tuning efficiency with model precision. These insights provide practical guidance for deploying AI-driven generative systems in accuracy-critical domains such as healthcare, finance, and legal services, ensuring scalability, reliability, and optimal performance in dynamic environments.</p></details> | 10 Pages |
| **[EACO-RAG: Towards Distributed Tiered LLM Deployment using Edge-Assisted and Collaborative RAG with Adaptive Knowledge Update](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20299v2)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in language tasks, but they require high computing power and rely on static knowledge. To overcome these limitations, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) incorporates up-to-date external information into LLMs without extensive fine-tuning. Meanwhile, small language models (SLMs) deployed on edge devices offer efficiency and low latency but often struggle with complex reasoning tasks. Unfortunately, current RAG approaches are predominantly based on centralized databases and have not been adapted to address the distinct constraints associated with deploying SLMs in edge environments. To bridge this gap, we propose Edge-Assisted and Collaborative RAG (EACO-RAG), a lightweight framework that leverages distributed edge nodes for adaptive knowledge updates and retrieval. EACO-RAG also employs a hierarchical collaborative gating mechanism to dynamically select among local, edge-assisted, and cloud-based strategies, with a carefully designed algorithm based on Safe Online Bayesian Optimization to maximize the potential performance enhancements. Experimental results demonstrate that EACO-RAG matches the accuracy of cloud-based knowledge graph RAG systems while reducing total costs by up to 84.6% under relaxed delay constraints and by 65.3% under stricter delay requirements. This work represents our initial effort toward achieving a distributed and scalable tiered LLM deployments, with EACO-RAG serving as a promising first step in unlocking the full potential of hybrid edge-cloud intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[KET-RAG: A Cost-Efficient Multi-Granular Indexing Framework for Graph-RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09304v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-RAG constructs a knowledge graph from text chunks to improve retrieval in Large Language Model (LLM)-based question answering. It is particularly useful in domains such as biomedicine, law, and political science, where retrieval often requires multi-hop reasoning over proprietary documents. Some existing Graph-RAG systems construct KNN graphs based on text chunk relevance, but this coarse-grained approach fails to capture entity relationships within texts, leading to sub-par retrieval and generation quality. To address this, recent solutions leverage LLMs to extract entities and relationships from text chunks, constructing triplet-based knowledge graphs. However, this approach incurs significant indexing costs, especially for large document collections. To ensure a good result accuracy while reducing the indexing cost, we propose KET-RAG, a multi-granular indexing framework. KET-RAG first identifies a small set of key text chunks and leverages an LLM to construct a knowledge graph skeleton. It then builds a text-keyword bipartite graph from all text chunks, serving as a lightweight alternative to a full knowledge graph. During retrieval, KET-RAG searches both structures: it follows the local search strategy of existing Graph-RAG systems on the skeleton while mimicking this search on the bipartite graph to improve retrieval quality. We evaluate eight solutions on two real-world datasets, demonstrating that KET-RAG outperforms all competitors in indexing cost, retrieval effectiveness, and generation quality. Notably, it achieves comparable or superior retrieval quality to Microsoft's Graph-RAG while reducing indexing costs by over an order of magnitude. Additionally, it improves the generation quality by up to 32.4% while lowering indexing costs by around 20%.</p></details> |  |

However, RAG still struggles to fully prevent hallucinated responses. To address this, it is essential to identify samples prone to hallucination or guide LLMs toward correct responses, which experts then annotate to develop high-quality datasets for refining LLMs. However, the growing scarcity of such datasets makes their creation challenging. This paper proposes using the vast amount of conversations from widespread LLM usage to build these datasets, training LLMs to avoid hallucination-prone questions while accurately responding to manageable ones. Given the impracticality of expert-annotating all conversation records, the paper introduces AL4RAG, which uses active learning to select the most suitable conversation samples for annotation, optimizing performance within an annotation budget. Additionally, recognizing that traditional active learning methods are not fully compatible with RAG due to unsuitable distance metrics, we develop a novel sample distance measurement for RAG active learning. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms baselines across multiple metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diversity Enhances an LLM's Performance in RAG and Long-context Task](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09017v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the challenge of context window limitations, primarily due to the quadratic time complexity of the self-attention mechanism (\(O(N^2)\), where \(N\) denotes the context window length). This constraint impacts tasks such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in question answering (Q\&A) and long context summarization. A common approach involves selecting content with the highest similarity to the query; however, this often leads to redundancy and the exclusion of diverse yet relevant information. Building on principles from Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) and Farthest Point Sampling (FPS), we integrate diversity into the content selection process. Our findings reveal that incorporating diversity substantially increases the recall of selecting relevant sentences or chunks before LLM-based Q\&A and summarization. These results highlight the importance of maintaining diversity in future LLM applications to further improve summarization and Q\&A outcomes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Better RAG using Relevant Information Gain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12101v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A common way to extend the memory of large language models (LLMs) is by retrieval augmented generation (RAG), which inserts text retrieved from a larger memory into an LLM's context window. However, the context window is typically limited to several thousand tokens, which limits the number of retrieved passages that can inform a model's response. For this reason, it's important to avoid occupying context window space with redundant information by ensuring a degree of diversity among retrieved passages. At the same time, the information should also be relevant to the current task. Most prior methods that encourage diversity among retrieved results, such as Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR), do so by incorporating an objective that explicitly trades off diversity and relevance. We propose a novel simple optimization metric based on relevant information gain, a probabilistic measure of the total information relevant to a query for a set of retrieved results. By optimizing this metric, diversity organically emerges from our system. When used as a drop-in replacement for the retrieval component of a RAG system, this method yields state-of-the-art performance on question answering tasks from the Retrieval Augmented Generation Benchmark (RGB), outperforming existing metrics that directly optimize for relevance and diversity.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 page paper submitted to EMNLP</p></details> |

However, current implementations face two critical challenges: maintaining factual accuracy and delivering coherent, context-aware instruction. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) partially addresses these issues, its reliance on pure semantic similarity limits its effectiveness in educational contexts where conceptual relationships are crucial. This paper introduces Knowledge Graph-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG), a novel framework that integrates structured knowledge representation with context-aware retrieval to enable more effective AI tutoring. We present three key contributions: (1) a novel architecture that grounds AI responses in structured domain knowledge, (2) empirical validation through controlled experiments (n=76) demonstrating significant learning improvements (35% increase in assessment scores, p<0.001), and (3) a comprehensive implementation framework addressing practical deployment considerations.

| **[A RAG Approach for Generating Competency Questions in Ontology Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08820v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Competency question (CQ) formulation is central to several ontology development and evaluation methodologies. Traditionally, the task of crafting these competency questions heavily relies on the effort of domain experts and knowledge engineers which is often time-consuming and labor-intensive. With the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), there arises the possibility to automate and enhance this process. Unlike other similar works which use existing ontologies or knowledge graphs as input to LLMs, we present a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach that uses LLMs for the automatic generation of CQs given a set of scientific papers considered to be a domain knowledge base. We investigate its performance and specifically, we study the impact of different number of papers to the RAG and different temperature setting of the LLM. We conduct experiments using GPT-4 on two domain ontology engineering tasks and compare results against ground-truth CQs constructed by domain experts. Empirical assessments on the results, utilizing evaluation metrics (precision and consistency), reveal that compared to zero-shot prompting, adding relevant domain knowledge to the RAG improves the performance of LLMs on generating CQs for concrete ontology engineering tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional RAG-based tool retrieval fails to capture structured dependencies between tools, limiting the retrieval accuracy of a retrieved tool's dependencies. For example, among a vector database of tools, a "get stock price" API requires a "stock ticker" parameter from a "get stock ticker" API, and both depend on OS-level internet connectivity tools. In this paper, we address this limitation by introducing Graph RAG-Tool Fusion, a novel plug-and-play approach that combines the strengths of vector-based retrieval with efficient graph traversal to capture all relevant tools (nodes) along with any nested dependencies (edges) within the predefined tool knowledge graph. We also present ToolLinkOS, a new tool selection benchmark of 573 fictional tools, spanning over 15 industries, each with an average of 6.3 tool dependencies. We demonstrate that Graph RAG-Tool Fusion achieves absolute improvements of 71.7% and 22.1% over na\"ive RAG on ToolLinkOS and ToolSandbox benchmarks, respectively (mAP@10).

While language models show promise in this context, their probabilistic nature complicates truthfulness and comprehensibility. This paper examines state-of-the-art Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhanced with alignment techniques to fulfill GDPR obligations. We evaluate RAG systems incorporating an alignment module like Rewindable Auto-regressive Inference (RAIN) and our proposed multidimensional extension, MultiRAIN, using a Privacy Q&A dataset. Responses are optimized for preciseness and comprehensibility and are assessed through 21 metrics, including deterministic and large language model-based evaluations. Our results show that RAG systems with an alignment module outperform baseline RAG systems on most metrics, though none fully match human answers. Principal component analysis of the results reveals complex interactions between metrics, highlighting the need to refine metrics.

Currently, the most popular methods in literature consists of fine-tuning the model on written mathematical content such as academic publications and textbooks, so that the model can learn to emulate the style of mathematical writing. In this project, we explore the effectiveness of using retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to address gaps in the mathematical reasoning of LLMs. We develop LemmaHead, a RAG knowledge base that supplements queries to the model with relevant mathematical context, with particular focus on context from published textbooks. To measure our model's performance in mathematical reasoning, our testing paradigm focuses on the task of automated theorem proving via generating proofs to a given mathematical claim in the Lean formal language.</p></details> |  |

Through systematic empirical evaluation of three different LLM variants across multiple parameter configurations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our testing methodology in assessing both functional correctness and extra-functional properties. Our framework implements 17 distinct metrics that encompass syntactic analysis, semantic evaluation, and behavioral evaluation through LLM judges. The study reveals significant information about how different architectural choices and parameter configurations affect system performance, particularly highlighting the impact of temperature and top-p parameters on response quality. The tests were carried out on a tourism recommendation system for the V\"armland region, utilizing standard and RAG-enhanced configurations. The results indicate that the newer LLM versions show modest improvements in performance metrics, though the differences are more pronounced in response length and complexity rather than in semantic quality. The research contributes practical insights for implementing robust testing practices in LLM-RAG systems, providing valuable guidance to organizations deploying these architectures in production environments.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Typically, such RAG systems retrieve search results, download HTML sources of the results, and then extract plain texts from the HTML sources. Plain text documents or chunks are fed into the LLMs to augment the generation. However, much of the structural and semantic information inherent in HTML, such as headings and table structures, is lost during this plain-text-based RAG process. To alleviate this problem, we propose HtmlRAG, which uses HTML instead of plain text as the format of retrieved knowledge in RAG. We believe HTML is better than plain text in modeling knowledge in external documents, and most LLMs possess robust capacities to understand HTML. However, utilizing HTML presents new challenges. HTML contains additional content such as tags, JavaScript, and CSS specifications, which bring extra input tokens and noise to the RAG system. To address this issue, we propose HTML cleaning, compression, and a two-step block-tree-based pruning strategy, to shorten the HTML while minimizing the loss of information. Experiments on six QA datasets confirm the superiority of using HTML in RAG systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WWW 2025 main conference.

To this aim, this paper introduces a solution driven by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which leverages the capabilities of generative Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the retrieval of health-related documents grounded in scientific evidence. In particular, we propose a three-stage model: in the first stage, the user's query is employed to retrieve topically relevant passages with associated references from a knowledge base constituted by scientific literature. In the second stage, these passages, alongside the initial query, are processed by LLMs to generate a contextually relevant rich text (GenText). In the last stage, the documents to be retrieved are evaluated and ranked both from the point of view of topical relevance and factual accuracy by means of their comparison with GenText, either through stance detection or semantic similarity. In addition to calculating factual accuracy, GenText can offer a layer of explainability for it, aiding users in understanding the reasoning behind the retrieval. Experimental evaluation of our model on benchmark datasets and against baseline models demonstrates its effectiveness in enhancing the retrieval of both topically relevant and factually accurate health information, thus presenting a significant step forward in the health misinformation mitigation problem.</p></details> |  |

While existing approaches such as ReAct maintain reasoning chains within the language model's context window, we observe that this often leads to plan fragmentation and execution failures. Our key insight is that by isolating the reasoning plan as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) outside the LM's working memory, we can enable (1) systematic exploration of reasoning paths, (2) atomic subqueries enabling precise retrievals and grounding, and (3) efficiency through parallel execution and bounded context window utilization. Moreover, Plan*RAG's modular design allows it to be integrated with existing RAG methods, thus providing a practical solution to improve current RAG systems. On standard multi-hop reasoning benchmarks, Plan*RAG consistently achieves improvements over recently proposed methods such as RQ-RAG and Self-RAG, while maintaining comparable computational costs.</p></details> | 19 pages, preprint |

However, their reliance on static training data limits their ability to respond to dynamic, real time queries, resulting in outdated or inaccurate outputs. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a solution, enhancing LLMs by integrating real time data retrieval to provide contextually relevant and up-to-date responses. Despite its promise, traditional RAG systems are constrained by static workflows and lack the adaptability required for multistep reasoning and complex task management. Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG) transcends these limitations by embedding autonomous AI agents into the RAG pipeline. These agents leverage agentic design patterns reflection, planning, tool use, and multiagent collaboration to dynamically manage retrieval strategies, iteratively refine contextual understanding, and adapt workflows to meet complex task requirements. This integration enables Agentic RAG systems to deliver unparalleled flexibility, scalability, and context awareness across diverse applications. This survey provides a comprehensive exploration of Agentic RAG, beginning with its foundational principles and the evolution of RAG paradigms.

| **[Addressing Hallucinations with RAG and NMISS in Italian Healthcare LLM Chatbots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04235v2)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>I combine detection and mitigation techniques to addresses hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs). Mitigation is achieved in a question-answering Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework while detection is obtained by introducing the Negative Missing Information Scoring System (NMISS), which accounts for contextual relevance in responses. While RAG mitigates hallucinations by grounding answers in external data, NMISS refines the evaluation by identifying cases where traditional metrics incorrectly flag contextually accurate responses as hallucinations. I use Italian health news articles as context to evaluate LLM performance. Results show that Gemma2 and GPT-4 outperform the other models, with GPT-4 producing answers closely aligned with reference responses. Mid-tier models, such as Llama2, Llama3, and Mistral benefit significantly from NMISS, highlighting their ability to provide richer contextual information. This combined approach offers new insights into the reduction and more accurate assessment of hallucinations in LLMs, with applications in real-world healthcare tasks and other domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging LLM Agents for Automated Optimization Modeling for SASP Problems: A Graph-RAG based Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18320v1)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated optimization modeling (AOM) has evoked considerable interest with the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches predominantly rely on prompt engineering, utilizing meticulously designed expert response chains or structured guidance. However, prompt-based techniques have failed to perform well in the sensor array signal processing (SASP) area due the lack of specific domain knowledge. To address this issue, we propose an automated modeling approach based on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique, which consists of two principal components: a multi-agent (MA) structure and a graph-based RAG (Graph-RAG) process. The MA structure is tailored for the architectural AOM process, with each agent being designed based on principles of human modeling procedure. The Graph-RAG process serves to match user query with specific SASP modeling knowledge, thereby enhancing the modeling result. Results on ten classical signal processing problems demonstrate that the proposed approach (termed as MAG-RAG) outperforms several AOM benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Balancing Content Size in RAG-Text2SQL System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15723v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising solution for converting natural language queries into SQL commands, enabling seamless database interaction. However, these Text-to-SQL (Text2SQL) systems face inherent limitations, hallucinations, outdated knowledge, and untraceable reasoning. To address these challenges, the integration of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with Text2SQL models has gained traction. RAG serves as a retrieval mechanism, providing essential contextual information, such as table schemas and metadata, to enhance the query generation process. Despite their potential, RAG + Text2SQL systems are susceptible to the quality and size of retrieved documents. While richer document content can improve schema relevance and retrieval accuracy, it also introduces noise, increasing the risk of hallucinations and reducing query fidelity as the prompt size of the Text2SQL model increases. This research investigates the nuanced trade-off between document size and quality, aiming to strike a balance that optimizes system performance. Key thresholds are identified where performance degradation occurs, along with actionable strategies to mitigate these challenges. Additionally, we explore the phenomenon of hallucinations in Text2SQL models, emphasizing the critical role of curated document presentation in minimizing errors. Our findings provide a roadmap for enhancing the robustness of RAG + Text2SQL systems, offering practical insights for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

Concepts such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and other advanced techniques have been developed to enhance these systems by integrating specific university data, enabling LLMs to provide informed responses on admissions and academic counseling. However, these enhanced RAG techniques often involve high operational costs and require the training of complex, specialized modules, which poses challenges for practical deployment. Additionally, in the educational context, it is crucial to provide accurate answers to prevent misinformation, a task that LLM-based systems find challenging without appropriate strategies and methods. In this paper, we introduce the Unified RAG (URAG) Framework, a hybrid approach that significantly improves the accuracy of responses, particularly for critical queries. Experimental results demonstrate that URAG enhances our in-house, lightweight model to perform comparably to state-of-the-art commercial models. Moreover, to validate its practical applicability, we conducted a case study at our educational institution, which received positive feedback and acclaim. This study not only proves the effectiveness of URAG but also highlights its feasibility for real-world implementation in educational settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at SoICT'24</p></details> |

However, current benchmarks for evaluating RAG systems suffer from two key deficiencies: (1) they fail to adequately measure LLMs' capability in handling long-context retrieval due to a lack of datasets that reflect the characteristics of retrieved documents, and (2) they lack a comprehensive evaluation method for assessing LLMs' ability to generate long-form responses that effectively exploits retrieved information. To address these shortcomings, we introduce the Long$^2$RAG benchmark and the Key Point Recall (KPR) metric. Long$^2$RAG comprises 280 questions spanning 10 domains and across 8 question categories, each associated with 5 retrieved documents with an average length of 2,444 words. KPR evaluates the extent to which LLMs incorporate key points extracted from the retrieved documents into their generated responses, providing a more nuanced assessment of their ability to exploit retrieved information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP'24 (Findings).

While it empowers individuals it also enables malicious actors to perpetrate scams such as fraudulent phone calls and user impersonations. This growing threat necessitates a robust system to protect individuals In this paper we introduce a novel real time fraud detection mechanism using Retrieval Augmented Generation technology to address this challenge on two fronts. First our system incorporates a continuously updating policy checking feature that transcribes phone calls in real time and uses RAG based models to verify that the caller is not soliciting private information thus ensuring transparency and the authenticity of the conversation. Second we implement a real time user impersonation check with a two step verification process to confirm the callers identity ensuring accountability. A key innovation of our system is the ability to update policies without retraining the entire model enhancing its adaptability. We validated our RAG based approach using synthetic call recordings achieving an accuracy of 97.98 percent and an F1score of 97.44 percent with 100 calls outperforming state of the art methods. This robust and flexible fraud detection system is well suited for real world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[A RAG-Based Institutional Assistant](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13880v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong text generation capabilities, they struggle in scenarios requiring access to structured knowledge bases or specific documents, limiting their effectiveness in knowledge-intensive tasks. To address this limitation, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models have been developed, enabling generative models to incorporate relevant document fragments into their inputs. In this paper, we design and evaluate a RAG-based virtual assistant specifically tailored for the University of S\~ao Paulo. Our system architecture comprises two key modules: a retriever and a generative model. We experiment with different types of models for both components, adjusting hyperparameters such as chunk size and the number of retrieved documents. Our optimal retriever model achieves a Top-5 accuracy of 30%, while our most effective generative model scores 22.04\% against ground truth answers. Notably, when the correct document chunks are supplied to the LLMs, accuracy significantly improves to 54.02%, an increase of over 30 percentage points. Conversely, without contextual input, performance declines to 13.68%. These findings highlight the critical role of database access in enhancing LLM performance. They also reveal the limitations of current semantic search methods in accurately identifying relevant documents and underscore the ongoing challenges LLMs face in generating precise responses.</p></details> |  |

However, LLMs are sensitive to the position of relevant information within contexts and tend to generate incorrect responses when such information is placed in the middle, known as `Lost in the Middle' phenomenon. In this paper, we introduce a framework that generates consistent outputs for decoder-only models, irrespective of the input context order. Experimental results for three open domain question answering tasks demonstrate position invariance, where the model is not sensitive to input context order, and superior robustness to irrelevent passages compared to prevailing approaches for RAG pipelines.</p></details> | 5 pages |

This study enhances interpretability in Chest X-ray (CXR) classification by using concept bottleneck models (CBMs) and a multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for report generation. By modeling relationships between visual features and clinical concepts, we create interpretable concept vectors that guide a multi-agent RAG system to generate radiology reports, enhancing clinical relevance, explainability, and transparency. Evaluation of the generated reports using an LLM-as-a-judge confirmed the interpretability and clinical utility of our model's outputs. On the COVID-QU dataset, our model achieved 81% classification accuracy and demonstrated robust report generation performance, with five key metrics ranging between 84% and 90%. This interpretable multi-agent framework bridges the gap between high-performance AI and the explainability required for reliable AI-driven CXR analysis in clinical settings.

However, the integration of external documents into the generation process raises significant privacy concerns. Indeed, when added to a prompt, it is not possible to guarantee a response will not inadvertently expose confidential data, leading to potential breaches of privacy and ethical dilemmas. This paper explores a practical solution to this problem suitable to general knowledge extraction from personal data. It shows \emph{differentially private token generation} is a viable approach to private RAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating Diverse Q&A Benchmarks for RAG Evaluation with DataMorgana](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12789v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, especially in domain-specific contexts, requires benchmarks that address the distinctive requirements of the applicative scenario. Since real data can be hard to obtain, a common strategy is to use LLM-based methods to generate synthetic data. Existing solutions are general purpose: given a document, they generate a question to build a Q&A pair. However, although the generated questions can be individually good, they are typically not diverse enough to reasonably cover the different ways real end-users can interact with the RAG system. We introduce here DataMorgana, a tool for generating highly customizable and diverse synthetic Q&A benchmarks tailored to RAG applications. DataMorgana enables detailed configurations of user and question categories and provides control over their distribution within the benchmark. It uses a lightweight two-stage process, ensuring efficiency and fast iterations, while generating benchmarks that reflect the expected traffic. We conduct a thorough line of experiments, showing quantitatively and qualitatively that DataMorgana surpasses existing tools and approaches in producing lexically, syntactically, and semantically diverse question sets across domain-specific and general-knowledge corpora. DataMorgana will be made available to selected teams in the research community, as first beta testers, in the context of the upcoming SIGIR'2025 LiveRAG challenge to be announced in early February 2025.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual RAG: Expanding MLLM visual knowledge without fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10834v1)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved notable performance in computer vision tasks that require reasoning across visual and textual modalities, yet their capabilities are limited to their pre-trained data, requiring extensive fine-tuning for updates. Recent researches have explored the use of In-Context Learning (ICL) to overcome these challenges by providing a set of demonstrating examples as context to augment MLLMs performance in several tasks, showing that many-shot ICL leads to substantial improvements compared to few-shot ICL. However, the reliance on numerous demonstrating examples and the limited MLLMs context windows presents significant obstacles. This paper aims to address these challenges by introducing a novel approach, Visual RAG, that synergically combines the MLLMs capability to learn from the context, with a retrieval mechanism. The crux of this approach is to ensure to augment the MLLM knowledge by selecting only the most relevant demonstrating examples for the query, pushing it to learn by analogy. In this way, relying on the new information provided dynamically during inference time, the resulting system is not limited to the knowledge extracted from the training data, but can be updated rapidly and easily without fine-tuning. Furthermore, this greatly reduces the computational costs for improving the model image classification performance, and augments the model knowledge to new visual domains and tasks it was not trained for. Extensive experiments on eight different datasets in the state of the art spanning several domains and image classification tasks show that the proposed Visual RAG, compared to the most recent state of the art (i.e., many-shot ICL), is able to obtain an accuracy that is very close or even higher (approx. +2% improvement on average) while using a much smaller set of demonstrating examples (approx. only 23% on average).</p></details> |  |
| **[4bit-Quantization in Vector-Embedding for RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10534v1)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a promising technique that has shown great potential in addressing some of the limitations of large language models (LLMs). LLMs have two major limitations: they can contain outdated information due to their training data, and they can generate factually inaccurate responses, a phenomenon known as hallucinations. RAG aims to mitigate these issues by leveraging a database of relevant documents, which are stored as embedding vectors in a high-dimensional space. However, one of the challenges of using high-dimensional embeddings is that they require a significant amount of memory to store. This can be a major issue, especially when dealing with large databases of documents. To alleviate this problem, we propose the use of 4-bit quantization to store the embedding vectors. This involves reducing the precision of the vectors from 32-bit floating-point numbers to 4-bit integers, which can significantly reduce the memory requirements. Our approach has several benefits. Firstly, it significantly reduces the memory storage requirements of the high-dimensional vector database, making it more feasible to deploy RAG systems in resource-constrained environments. Secondly, it speeds up the searching process, as the reduced precision of the vectors allows for faster computation. Our code is available at https://github.com/taeheej/4bit-Quantization-in-Vector-Embedding-for-RAG</p></details> |  |

However, how to make them reliable tools for some specific tasks such as automated short answer grading (ASAG) remains a challenge. We present SteLLA (Structured Grading System Using LLMs with RAG) in which a) Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach is used to empower LLMs specifically on the ASAG task by extracting structured information from the highly relevant and reliable external knowledge based on the instructor-provided reference answer and rubric, b) an LLM performs a structured and question-answering-based evaluation of student answers to provide analytical grades and feedback. A real-world dataset that contains students' answers in an exam was collected from a college-level Biology course. Experiments show that our proposed system can achieve substantial agreement with the human grader while providing break-down grades and feedback on all the knowledge points examined in the problem. A qualitative and error analysis of the feedback generated by GPT4 shows that GPT4 is good at capturing facts while may be prone to inferring too much implication from the given text in the grading task which provides insights into the usage of LLMs in the ASAG system.</p></details> |  |

We propose the concept of the Sustainable AI Trilemma, highlighting the tensions between AI capability, digital equity, and environmental sustainability. Through a systematic case study of LLM agents and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), we analyze the energy costs embedded in memory module designs and introduce novel metrics to quantify the trade-offs between energy consumption and system performance. Our experimental results reveal significant energy inefficiencies in current memory-augmented frameworks and demonstrate that resource-constrained environments face disproportionate efficiency penalties. Our findings challenge the prevailing LLM-centric paradigm in agent design and provide practical insights for developing more sustainable AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[ASTRID -- An Automated and Scalable TRIaD for the Evaluation of RAG-based Clinical Question Answering Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08208v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive potential in clinical question answering (QA), with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) emerging as a leading approach for ensuring the factual accuracy of model responses. However, current automated RAG metrics perform poorly in clinical and conversational use cases. Using clinical human evaluations of responses is expensive, unscalable, and not conducive to the continuous iterative development of RAG systems. To address these challenges, we introduce ASTRID - an Automated and Scalable TRIaD for evaluating clinical QA systems leveraging RAG - consisting of three metrics: Context Relevance (CR), Refusal Accuracy (RA), and Conversational Faithfulness (CF). Our novel evaluation metric, CF, is designed to better capture the faithfulness of a model's response to the knowledge base without penalising conversational elements. To validate our triad, we curate a dataset of over 200 real-world patient questions posed to an LLM-based QA agent during surgical follow-up for cataract surgery - the highest volume operation in the world - augmented with clinician-selected questions for emergency, clinical, and non-clinical out-of-domain scenarios. We demonstrate that CF can predict human ratings of faithfulness better than existing definitions for conversational use cases. Furthermore, we show that evaluation using our triad consisting of CF, RA, and CR exhibits alignment with clinician assessment for inappropriate, harmful, or unhelpful responses. Finally, using nine different LLMs, we demonstrate that the three metrics can closely agree with human evaluations, highlighting the potential of these metrics for use in LLM-driven automated evaluation pipelines. We also publish the prompts and datasets for these experiments, providing valuable resources for further research and development.</p></details> | 29 pages |

In this work, an online update method is proposed, which is based on the existing Retrieval Enhanced Generation (RAG) model with multiple innovation mechanisms. Firstly, the dynamic memory is used to capture the emerging data samples, and then gradually integrate them into the core model through a tunable knowledge distillation strategy. At the same time, hierarchical indexing and multi-layer gating mechanism are introduced into the retrieval module to ensure that the retrieved content is more targeted and accurate. Finally, a multi-stage network structure is established for different types of inputs in the generation stage, and cross-attention matching and screening are carried out on the intermediate representations of each stage to ensure the effective integration and iterative update of new and old knowledge. Experimental results show that the proposed method is better than the existing mainstream comparison models in terms of knowledge retention and inference accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrustRAG: Enhancing Robustness and Trustworthiness in RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00879v2)** | 2025-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge sources, enabling more accurate and contextually relevant responses tailored to user queries. However, these systems remain vulnerable to corpus poisoning attacks that can significantly degrade LLM performance through the injection of malicious content. To address these challenges, we propose TrustRAG, a robust framework that systematically filters compromised and irrelevant contents before they are retrieved for generation. Our approach implements a two-stage defense mechanism: At the first stage, it employs K-means clustering to identify potential attack patterns in retrieved documents using cosine similarity and ROUGE metrics as guidance, effectively isolating suspicious content. Secondly, it performs a self-assessment which detects malicious documents and resolves discrepancies between the model's internal knowledge and external information. TrustRAG functions as a plug-and-play, training-free module that integrates seamlessly with any language model, whether open or closed-source. In addition, TrustRAG maintains high contextual relevance while strengthening defenses against corpus poisoning attacks. Through extensive experimental validation, we demonstrate that TrustRAG delivers substantial improvements in retrieval accuracy, efficiency, and attack resistance compared to existing approaches across multiple model architectures and datasets. We have made TrustRAG available as open-source software at \url{https://github.com/HuichiZhou/TrustRAG}.</p></details> |  |
| **[First Token Probability Guided RAG for Telecom Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06468v1)** | 2025-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention for their impressive general-purpose capabilities. For applications requiring intricate domain knowledge, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown a distinct advantage in incorporating domain-specific information into LLMs. However, existing RAG research has not fully addressed the challenges of Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA) in telecommunications, particularly in terms of retrieval quality and mitigating hallucinations. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel first token probability guided RAG framework. This framework leverages confidence scores to optimize key hyperparameters, such as chunk number and chunk window size, while dynamically adjusting the context. Our method starts by retrieving the most relevant chunks and generates a single token as the potential answer. The probabilities of all options are then normalized to serve as confidence scores, which guide the dynamic adjustment of the context. By iteratively optimizing the hyperparameters based on these confidence scores, we can continuously improve RAG performance. We conducted experiments to validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating its potential to enhance accuracy in domain-specific MCQA tasks.</p></details> |  |

Built on the LLaMA-3B architecture and fine-tuned with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on a 15,000-sample subset of HotpotQA, LLMQuoter adopts a "quote-first-then-answer" strategy, efficiently identifying key quotes before passing curated snippets to reasoning models. This workflow reduces cognitive overhead and outperforms full-context approaches like Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning (RAFT), achieving over 20-point accuracy gains across both small and large language models. By leveraging knowledge distillation from a high-performing teacher model, LLMQuoter achieves competitive results in a resource-efficient fine-tuning setup. It democratizes advanced RAG capabilities, delivering significant performance improvements without requiring extensive model retraining. Our results highlight the potential of distilled quote-based reasoning to streamline complex workflows, offering a scalable and practical solution for researchers and practitioners alike.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-task retriever fine-tuning for domain-specific and efficient RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04652v1)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become ubiquitous when deploying Large Language Models (LLMs), as it can address typical limitations such as generating hallucinated or outdated information. However, when building real-world RAG applications, practical issues arise. First, the retrieved information is generally domain-specific. Since it is computationally expensive to fine-tune LLMs, it is more feasible to fine-tune the retriever to improve the quality of the data included in the LLM input. Second, as more applications are deployed in the same real-world system, one cannot afford to deploy separate retrievers. Moreover, these RAG applications normally retrieve different kinds of data. Our solution is to instruction fine-tune a small retriever encoder on a variety of domain-specific tasks to allow us to deploy one encoder that can serve many use cases, thereby achieving low-cost, scalability, and speed. We show how this encoder generalizes to out-of-domain settings as well as to an unseen retrieval task on real-world enterprise use cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 2 figures.

| **[Political Events using RAG with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15701v1)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the contemporary digital landscape, media content stands as the foundation for political news analysis, offering invaluable insights sourced from various channels like news articles, social media updates, speeches, and reports. Natural Language Processing (NLP) has revolutionized Political Information Extraction (IE), automating tasks such as Event Extraction (EE) from these diverse media outlets. While traditional NLP methods often necessitate specialized expertise to build rule-based systems or train machine learning models with domain-specific datasets, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) driven by Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) presents a promising alternative. These models offer accessibility, alleviating challenges associated with model construction from scratch and reducing the dependency on extensive datasets during the training phase, thus facilitating rapid implementation. However, challenges persist in handling domain-specific tasks, leading to the development of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. RAG enhances LLMs by integrating external data retrieval, enriching their contextual understanding, and expanding their knowledge base beyond pre-existing training data. To illustrate RAG's efficacy, we introduce the Political EE system, specifically tailored to extract political event information from news articles. Understanding these political insights is essential for remaining informed about the latest political advancements, whether on a national or global scale.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional manual methods for data extraction are often time-consuming and resource-intensive, prompting the adoption of digital transformation initiatives to enhance efficiency. Yet, concerns persist regarding the sustainability of such initiatives and their alignment with the United Nations (UN)'s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This research aims to explore the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) as a sustainable solution for Information Extraction (IE) and processing. The research methodology involves reviewing existing solutions for business decision-making, noting that many systems require training new machine learning models, which are resource-intensive and have significant environmental impacts. Instead, we propose a sustainable business solution using pre-existing LLMs that can work with diverse datasets. We link domain-specific datasets to tailor LLMs to company needs and employ a Multi-Agent architecture to divide tasks such as information retrieval, enrichment, and classification among specialized agents. This approach optimizes the extraction process and improves overall efficiency. Through the utilization of these technologies, businesses can optimize resource utilization, improve decision-making processes, and contribute to sustainable development goals, thereby fostering environmental responsibility within the corporate sector.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional vector similarity-based approaches, our system performs medical reasoning at each tree node through a specialized RAG process. Starting from the root node with initial symptoms, the system conducts step-wise medical analysis to identify potential underlying conditions and their corresponding diagnostic requirements. At each level, instead of simple matching, our RAG-enhanced nodes analyze retrieved medical knowledge to understand symptom-disease relationships and determine the most appropriate diagnostic path. The system dynamically adjusts its recommendation strategy based on medical reasoning results, considering factors such as urgency levels and diagnostic uncertainty. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in terms of coverage rate, accuracy, and miss rate compared to conventional retrieval-based methods. This work represents a significant advance in medical test recommendation by introducing medical reasoning capabilities into the traditional tree-based retrieval structure.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents an optimization framework that combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with an innovative multi-head early exit architecture to concurrently enhance both aspects. By integrating Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) as efficient retrieval mechanisms, we are able to significantly reduce data retrieval times while maintaining high model performance. The early exit strategy employed allows for dynamic termination of model inference, utilizing real-time predictive confidence assessments across multiple heads. This not only quickens the responsiveness of LLMs but also upholds or improves their accuracy, making it ideal for real-time application scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate how this architecture effectively decreases computation time without sacrificing the accuracy needed for reliable recommendation delivery, establishing a new standard for efficient, real-time LLM deployment in commercial systems.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging adaptive RAG for interpretable mental health screening through psychometric practice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00982v1)** | 2025-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In psychological practice, standardized questionnaires serve as essential tools for assessing mental constructs (e.g., attitudes, traits, and emotions) through structured questions (aka items). With the increasing prevalence of social media platforms where users share personal experiences and emotions, researchers are exploring computational methods to leverage this data for rapid mental health screening. In this study, we propose a novel adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach that completes psychological questionnaires by analyzing social media posts. Our method retrieves the most relevant user posts for each question in a psychological survey and uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict questionnaire scores in a zero-shot setting. Our findings are twofold. First we demonstrate that this approach can effectively predict users' responses to psychological questionnaires, such as the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II), achieving performance comparable to or surpassing state-of-the-art models on Reddit-based benchmark datasets without relying on training data. Second, we show how this methodology can be generalized as a scalable screening tool, as the final assessment is systematically derived by completing standardized questionnaires and tracking how individual item responses contribute to the diagnosis, aligning with established psychometric practices.</p></details> |  |
| **[EdgeRAG: Online-Indexed RAG for Edge Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21023v2)** | 2024-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) on resource-constrained edge devices is challenging due to limited memory and processing power. In this work, we propose EdgeRAG which addresses the memory constraint by pruning embeddings within clusters and generating embeddings on-demand during retrieval. To avoid the latency of generating embeddings for large tail clusters, EdgeRAG pre-computes and stores embeddings for these clusters, while adaptively caching remaining embeddings to minimize redundant computations and further optimize latency. The result from BEIR suite shows that EdgeRAG offers significant latency reduction over the baseline IVF index, but with similar generation quality while allowing all of our evaluated datasets to fit into the memory.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhanced Multimodal RAG-LLM for Accurate Visual Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20927v1)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), such as GPT-4o, Gemini, LLaVA, and Flamingo, have made significant progress in integrating visual and textual modalities, excelling in tasks like visual question answering (VQA), image captioning, and content retrieval. They can generate coherent and contextually relevant descriptions of images. However, they still face challenges in accurately identifying and counting objects and determining their spatial locations, particularly in complex scenes with overlapping or small objects. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework based on multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which introduces structured scene graphs to enhance object recognition, relationship identification, and spatial understanding within images. Our framework improves the MLLM's capacity to handle tasks requiring precise visual descriptions, especially in scenarios with challenging perspectives, such as aerial views or scenes with dense object arrangements. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on the VG-150 dataset that focuses on first-person visual understanding and the AUG dataset that involves aerial imagery. The results show that our approach consistently outperforms existing MLLMs in VQA tasks, which stands out in recognizing, localizing, and quantifying objects in different spatial contexts and provides more accurate visual descriptions.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, under review</p></details> |
| **[Pirates of the RAG: Adaptively Attacking LLMs to Leak Knowledge Bases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18295v2)** | 2024-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing ubiquity of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in several real-world services triggers severe concerns about their security. A RAG system improves the generative capabilities of a Large Language Models (LLM) by a retrieval mechanism which operates on a private knowledge base, whose unintended exposure could lead to severe consequences, including breaches of private and sensitive information. This paper presents a black-box attack to force a RAG system to leak its private knowledge base which, differently from existing approaches, is adaptive and automatic. A relevance-based mechanism and an attacker-side open-source LLM favor the generation of effective queries to leak most of the (hidden) knowledge base. Extensive experimentation proves the quality of the proposed algorithm in different RAG pipelines and domains, comparing to very recent related approaches, which turn out to be either not fully black-box, not adaptive, or not based on open-source models. The findings from our study remark the urgent need for more robust privacy safeguards in the design and deployment of RAG systems.</p></details> |  |
