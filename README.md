| **[TTRL: Test-Time Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16084v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates Reinforcement Learning (RL) on data without explicit labels for reasoning tasks in Large Language Models (LLMs). The core challenge of the problem is reward estimation during inference while not having access to ground-truth information. While this setting appears elusive, we find that common practices in Test-Time Scaling (TTS), such as majority voting, yield surprisingly effective rewards suitable for driving RL training. In this work, we introduce Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL), a novel method for training LLMs using RL on unlabeled data. TTRL enables self-evolution of LLMs by utilizing the priors in the pre-trained models. Our experiments demonstrate that TTRL consistently improves performance across a variety of tasks and models. Notably, TTRL boosts the pass@1 performance of Qwen-2.5-Math-7B by approximately 159% on the AIME 2024 with only unlabeled test data. Furthermore, although TTRL is only supervised by the Maj@N metric, TTRL has demonstrated performance to consistently surpass the upper limit of the initial model, and approach the performance of models trained directly on test data with ground-truth labels. Our experimental findings validate the general effectiveness of TTRL across various tasks, and highlight TTRL's potential for broader tasks and domains.

Inspired by the self-reflection capabilities emergent in large language models, we propose ReflectionFlow, an inference-time framework enabling diffusion models to iteratively reflect upon and refine their outputs. ReflectionFlow introduces three complementary inference-time scaling axes: (1) noise-level scaling to optimize latent initialization; (2) prompt-level scaling for precise semantic guidance; and most notably, (3) reflection-level scaling, which explicitly provides actionable reflections to iteratively assess and correct previous generations. To facilitate reflection-level scaling, we construct GenRef, a large-scale dataset comprising 1 million triplets, each containing a reflection, a flawed image, and an enhanced image. Leveraging this dataset, we efficiently perform reflection tuning on state-of-the-art diffusion transformer, FLUX.1-dev, by jointly modeling multimodal inputs within a unified framework. Experimental results show that ReflectionFlow significantly outperforms naive noise-level scaling methods, offering a scalable and compute-efficient solution toward higher-quality image synthesis on challenging tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>All c...</summary><p>All code, checkpoints, and datasets are available at \url{https://diffusion-cot.github.io/reflection2perfection}</p></details> |
| **[LLMs are Greedy Agents: Effects of RL Fine-tuning on Decision-Making Abilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16078v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked interest in various agentic applications. A key hypothesis is that LLMs, leveraging common sense and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, can effectively explore and efficiently solve complex domains. However, LLM agents have been found to suffer from sub-optimal exploration and the knowing-doing gap, the inability to effectively act on knowledge present in the model. In this work, we systematically study why LLMs perform sub-optimally in decision-making scenarios. In particular, we closely examine three prevalent failure modes: greediness, frequency bias, and the knowing-doing gap. We propose mitigation of these shortcomings by fine-tuning via Reinforcement Learning (RL) on self-generated CoT rationales. Our experiments across multi-armed bandits, contextual bandits, and Tic-tac-toe, demonstrate that RL fine-tuning enhances the decision-making abilities of LLMs by increasing exploration and narrowing the knowing-doing gap. Finally, we study both classic exploration mechanisms, such as $\epsilon$-greedy, and LLM-specific approaches, such as self-correction and self-consistency, to enable more effective fine-tuning of LLMs for decision-making.</p></details> |  |
| **[Plan-and-Act: Improving Planning of Agents for Long-Horizon Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09572v3)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in enabling language agents to tackle simple tasks. However, applying them for complex, multi-step, long-horizon tasks remains a challenge. Recent work have found success by separating high-level planning from low-level execution, which enables the model to effectively balance high-level planning objectives and low-level execution details. However, generating accurate plans remains difficult since LLMs are not inherently trained for this task. To address this, we propose Plan-and-Act, a novel framework that incorporates explicit planning into LLM-based agents and introduces a scalable method to enhance plan generation through a novel synthetic data generation method. Plan-and-Act consists of a Planner model which generates structured, high-level plans to achieve user goals, and an Executor model that translates these plans into environment-specific actions. To train the Planner effectively, we introduce a synthetic data generation method that annotates ground-truth trajectories with feasible plans, augmented with diverse and extensive examples to enhance generalization. We evaluate Plan-and-Act using web navigation as a representative long-horizon planning environment, demonstrating a state-of-the-art 57.58% success rate on the WebArena-Lite benchmark as well as a text-only state-of-the-art 81.36% success rate on WebVoyager.</p></details> |  |

PHYBench consists of 500 meticulously curated physics problems based on real-world physical scenarios, designed to assess the ability of models to understand and reason about realistic physical processes. Covering mechanics, electromagnetism, thermodynamics, optics, modern physics, and advanced physics, the benchmark spans difficulty levels from high school exercises to undergraduate problems and Physics Olympiad challenges. Additionally, we propose the Expression Edit Distance (EED) Score, a novel evaluation metric based on the edit distance between mathematical expressions, which effectively captures differences in model reasoning processes and results beyond traditional binary scoring methods. We evaluate various LLMs on PHYBench and compare their performance with human experts. Our results reveal that even state-of-the-art reasoning models significantly lag behind human experts, highlighting their limitations and the need for improvement in complex physical reasoning scenarios. Our benchmark results and dataset are publicly available at https://phybench-official.github.io/phybench-demo/.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages ,8 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, as context length grows, the computational cost of attention increases quadratically with the number of tokens, presenting significant efficiency challenges. This paper presents an analysis of various Key-Value (KV) cache compression strategies, offering a comprehensive taxonomy that categorizes these methods by their underlying principles and implementation techniques. Furthermore, we evaluate their impact on performance and inference latency, providing critical insights into their effectiveness. Our findings highlight the trade-offs involved in KV cache compression and its influence on handling long-context scenarios, paving the way for more efficient LLM implementations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference (CICC) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Automated Static Vulnerability Detection via a Holistic Neuro-symbolic Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16057v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Static vulnerability detection is still a challenging problem and demands excessive human efforts, e.g., manual curation of good vulnerability patterns. None of prior works, including classic program analysis or Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches, have fully automated such vulnerability pattern generations with reasonable detection accuracy. In this paper, we design and implement, MoCQ, a novel holistic neuro-symbolic framework that combines the complementary strengths of LLMs and classical static analysis to enable scalable vulnerability detection. The key insight is that MoCQ leverages an LLM to automatically extract vulnerability patterns and translate them into detection queries, and then on static analysis to refine such queries in a feedback loop and eventually execute them for analyzing large codebases and mining vulnerabilities. We evaluate MoCQ on seven types of vulnerabilities spanning two programming languages. We found MoCQ-generated queries uncovered at least 12 patterns that were missed by experts. On a ground truth dataset, MoCQ achieved comparable precision and recall compared to expert-crafted queries. Moreover, MoCQ has identified seven previously unknown vulnerabilities in real-world applications, demonstrating its practical effectiveness. We have responsibly disclosed them to the corresponding developers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Honey, I Shrunk the Language Model: Impact of Knowledge Distillation Methods on Performance and Explainability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16056v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has increasingly influenced modern society, recently in particular through significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, high computational and storage demands of LLMs still limit their deployment in resource-constrained environments. Knowledge distillation addresses this challenge by training a small student model from a larger teacher model. Previous research has introduced several distillation methods for both generating training data and for training the student model. Despite their relevance, the effects of state-of-the-art distillation methods on model performance and explainability have not been thoroughly investigated and compared. In this work, we enlarge the set of available methods by applying critique-revision prompting to distillation for data generation and by synthesizing existing methods for training. For these methods, we provide a systematic comparison based on the widely used Commonsense Question-Answering (CQA) dataset. While we measure performance via student model accuracy, we employ a human-grounded study to evaluate explainability. We contribute new distillation methods and their comparison in terms of both performance and explainability. This should further advance the distillation of small language models and, thus, contribute to broader applicability and faster diffusion of LLM technology.</p></details> |  |
| **[LASER: A Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Learning Spatial-Temporal Scene Graphs with Weak Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07647v5)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised approaches for learning spatio-temporal scene graphs (STSG) from video are greatly hindered due to their reliance on STSG-annotated videos, which are labor-intensive to construct at scale. Is it feasible to instead use readily available video captions as weak supervision? To address this question, we propose LASER, a neuro-symbolic framework to enable training STSG generators using only video captions. LASER employs large language models to first extract logical specifications with rich spatio-temporal semantic information from video captions. LASER then trains the underlying STSG generator to align the predicted STSG with the specification. The alignment algorithm overcomes the challenges of weak supervision by leveraging a differentiable symbolic reasoner and using a combination of contrastive, temporal, and semantics losses. The overall approach efficiently trains low-level perception models to extract a fine-grained STSG that conforms to the video caption. In doing so, it enables a novel methodology for learning STSGs without tedious annotations. We evaluate our method on three video datasets: OpenPVSG, 20BN, and MUGEN. Our approach demonstrates substantial improvements over fully-supervised baselines, achieving a unary predicate prediction accuracy of 27.78% (+12.65%) and a binary recall@5 of 0.42 (+0.22) on OpenPVSG. Additionally, LASER exceeds baselines by 7% on 20BN and 5.2% on MUGEN in terms of overall predicate prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Certified Mitigation of Worst-Case LLM Copyright Infringement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16046v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exposure of large language models (LLMs) to copyrighted material during pre-training raises concerns about unintentional copyright infringement post deployment. This has driven the development of "copyright takedown" methods, post-training approaches aimed at preventing models from generating content substantially similar to copyrighted ones. While current mitigation approaches are somewhat effective for average-case risks, we demonstrate that they overlook worst-case copyright risks exhibits by the existence of long, verbatim quotes from copyrighted sources. We propose BloomScrub, a remarkably simple yet highly effective inference-time approach that provides certified copyright takedown. Our method repeatedly interleaves quote detection with rewriting techniques to transform potentially infringing segments. By leveraging efficient data sketches (Bloom filters), our approach enables scalable copyright screening even for large-scale real-world corpora. When quotes beyond a length threshold cannot be removed, the system can abstain from responding, offering certified risk reduction. Experimental results show that BloomScrub reduces infringement risk, preserves utility, and accommodates different levels of enforcement stringency with adaptive abstention. Our results suggest that lightweight, inference-time methods can be surprisingly effective for copyright prevention.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs meet Federated Learning for Scalable and Secure IoT Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16032v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid expansion of IoT ecosystems introduces severe challenges in scalability, security, and real-time decision-making. Traditional centralized architectures struggle with latency, privacy concerns, and excessive resource consumption, making them unsuitable for modern large-scale IoT deployments. This paper presents a novel Federated Learning-driven Large Language Model (FL-LLM) framework, designed to enhance IoT system intelligence while ensuring data privacy and computational efficiency. The framework integrates Generative IoT (GIoT) models with a Gradient Sensing Federated Strategy (GSFS), dynamically optimizing model updates based on real-time network conditions. By leveraging a hybrid edge-cloud processing architecture, our approach balances intelligence, scalability, and security in distributed IoT environments. Evaluations on the IoT-23 dataset demonstrate that our framework improves model accuracy, reduces response latency, and enhances energy efficiency, outperforming traditional FL techniques (i.e., FedAvg, FedOpt). These findings highlight the potential of integrating LLM-powered federated learning into large-scale IoT ecosystems, paving the way for more secure, scalable, and adaptive IoT management solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM) 2025 for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[LiveCC: Learning Video LLM with Streaming Speech Transcription at Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16030v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent video large language models (Video LLMs) often depend on costly human annotations or proprietary model APIs (e.g., GPT-4o) to produce training data, which limits their training at scale. In this paper, we explore large-scale training for Video LLM with cheap automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts. Specifically, we propose a novel streaming training approach that densely interleaves the ASR words and video frames according to their timestamps. Compared to previous studies in vision-language representation with ASR, our method naturally fits the streaming characteristics of ASR, thus enabling the model to learn temporally-aligned, fine-grained vision-language modeling. To support the training algorithm, we introduce a data production pipeline to process YouTube videos and their closed captions (CC, same as ASR), resulting in Live-CC-5M dataset for pre-training and Live-WhisperX-526K dataset for high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Remarkably, even without SFT, the ASR-only pre-trained LiveCC-7B-Base model demonstrates competitive general video QA performance and exhibits a new capability in real-time video commentary. To evaluate this, we carefully design a new LiveSports-3K benchmark, using LLM-as-a-judge to measure the free-form commentary. Experiments show our final LiveCC-7B-Instruct model can surpass advanced 72B models (Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct, LLaVA-Video-72B) in commentary quality even working in a real-time mode. Meanwhile, it achieves state-of-the-art results at the 7B/8B scale on popular video QA benchmarks such as VideoMME and OVOBench, demonstrating the broad generalizability of our approach.

| **[Benchmarking LLM for Code Smells Detection: OpenAI GPT-4.0 vs DeepSeek-V3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16027v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Determining the most effective Large Language Model for code smell detection presents a complex challenge. This study introduces a structured methodology and evaluation matrix to tackle this issue, leveraging a curated dataset of code samples consistently annotated with known smells. The dataset spans four prominent programming languages Java, Python, JavaScript, and C++; allowing for cross language comparison. We benchmark two state of the art LLMs, OpenAI GPT 4.0 and DeepSeek-V3, using precision, recall, and F1 score as evaluation metrics. Our analysis covers three levels of detail: overall performance, category level performance, and individual code smell type performance. Additionally, we explore cost effectiveness by comparing the token based detection approach of GPT 4.0 with the pattern-matching techniques employed by DeepSeek V3. The study also includes a cost analysis relative to traditional static analysis tools such as SonarQube. The findings offer valuable guidance for practitioners in selecting an efficient, cost effective solution for automated code smell detection</p></details> |  |
| **[AlphaEdit: Null-Space Constrained Knowledge Editing for Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02355v4)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit hallucinations due to incorrect or outdated knowledge. Hence, model editing methods have emerged to enable targeted knowledge updates. To achieve this, a prevailing paradigm is the locating-then-editing approach, which first locates influential parameters and then edits them by introducing a perturbation. While effective, current studies have demonstrated that this perturbation inevitably disrupt the originally preserved knowledge within LLMs, especially in sequential editing scenarios. To address this, we introduce AlphaEdit, a novel solution that projects perturbation onto the null space of the preserved knowledge before applying it to the parameters. We theoretically prove that this projection ensures the output of post-edited LLMs remains unchanged when queried about the preserved knowledge, thereby mitigating the issue of disruption. Extensive experiments on various LLMs, including LLaMA3, GPT2-XL, and GPT-J, show that AlphaEdit boosts the performance of most locating-then-editing methods by an average of 36.7% with a single line of additional code for projection solely. Our code is available at: https://github.com/jianghoucheng/AlphaEdit.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAPO: Cost-Aware Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16005v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing by solving a wide range of tasks simply guided by a prompt. Yet their performance is highly sensitive to prompt formulation. While automated prompt optimization addresses this challenge by finding optimal prompts, current methods require a substantial number of LLM calls and input tokens, making prompt optimization expensive. We introduce CAPO (Cost-Aware Prompt Optimization), an algorithm that enhances prompt optimization efficiency by integrating AutoML techniques. CAPO is an evolutionary approach with LLMs as operators, incorporating racing to save evaluations and multi-objective optimization to balance performance with prompt length. It jointly optimizes instructions and few-shot examples while leveraging task descriptions for improved robustness. Our extensive experiments across diverse datasets and LLMs demonstrate that CAPO outperforms state-of-the-art discrete prompt optimization methods in 11/15 cases with improvements up to 21%p. Our algorithm achieves better performances already with smaller budgets, saves evaluations through racing, and decreases average prompt length via a length penalty, making it both cost-efficient and cost-aware. Even without few-shot examples, CAPO outperforms its competitors and generally remains robust to initial prompts. CAPO represents an important step toward making prompt optimization more powerful and accessible by improving cost-efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to AutoML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Network-aided Efficient LLM Services With Denoising-inspired Prompt Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03621v2)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various tasks, leading to their increasing adoption in diverse services delivered through wireless networks. There is a growing trend toward longer prompts to better leverage LLMs' capabilities and address difficult tasks. However, longer prompts not only increase data transmission costs but also require more computing resources and processing time, which impacts overall system efficiency and user experience. To address this challenge, we propose Joint Power and Prompt Optimization (JPPO), a framework that combines Small Language Model (SLM)-based prompt compression with wireless power allocation optimization. By deploying SLM at edge devices for prompt compression and employing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for joint optimization of compression ratio and transmission power, JPPO effectively balances service quality with resource efficiency. Furthermore, inspired by denoising diffusion models, we design a denoising-inspired prompt compression approach that iteratively compresses prompts by gradually removing non-critical information, further enhancing the framework's performance. Experimental results with long prompt tokens demonstrate that our framework achieves high service fidelity while optimizing power usage in wireless LLM services, significantly reducing the total service response time. With our DRL-based JPPO, the framework maintains fidelity comparable to the no-compression baseline while still achieving a 17% service time reduction through adaptive compression.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by SCIENCE CHINA Information Sciences. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2411.18010</p></details> |
| **[From Human Memory to AI Memory: A Survey on Memory Mechanisms in the Era of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15965v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Memory is the process of encoding, storing, and retrieving information, allowing humans to retain experiences, knowledge, skills, and facts over time, and serving as the foundation for growth and effective interaction with the world. It plays a crucial role in shaping our identity, making decisions, learning from past experiences, building relationships, and adapting to changes. In the era of large language models (LLMs), memory refers to the ability of an AI system to retain, recall, and use information from past interactions to improve future responses and interactions. Although previous research and reviews have provided detailed descriptions of memory mechanisms, there is still a lack of a systematic review that summarizes and analyzes the relationship between the memory of LLM-driven AI systems and human memory, as well as how we can be inspired by human memory to construct more powerful memory systems. To achieve this, in this paper, we propose a comprehensive survey on the memory of LLM-driven AI systems. In particular, we first conduct a detailed analysis of the categories of human memory and relate them to the memory of AI systems. Second, we systematically organize existing memory-related work and propose a categorization method based on three dimensions (object, form, and time) and eight quadrants. Finally, we illustrate some open problems regarding the memory of current AI systems and outline possible future directions for memory in the era of large language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[SWITCH: Studying with Teacher for Knowledge Distillation of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19503v2)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), they still face challenges related to high inference costs and memory requirements. To address these issues, Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as a popular method for model compression, with student-generated outputs (SGOs) as training data being particularly notable for reducing the mismatch between training and inference. However, SGOs often produce noisy and biased sequences, which can lead to misguidance from the teacher model, especially in long sequences. To mitigate these challenges, we propose SWITCH (Studying WIth TeaCHer for Knowledge Distillation), a novel approach that strategically incorporates the teacher model during the student's sequence generation. SWITCH identifies discrepancies between the token probabilities of the teacher and student models, allowing the teacher to intervene selectively, particularly in long sequences that are more prone to teacher misguidance. Extensive experimental results across three model families and five instruction-following datasets show that SWITCH surpasses traditional KD methods, particularly excelling in the generation of long sequential data.</p></details> | NAACL 2025 Findings |
| **[FairTranslate: An English-French Dataset for Gender Bias Evaluation in Machine Translation by Overcoming Gender Binarity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15941v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly leveraged for translation tasks but often fall short when translating inclusive language -- such as texts containing the singular 'they' pronoun or otherwise reflecting fair linguistic protocols. Because these challenges span both computational and societal domains, it is imperative to critically evaluate how well LLMs handle inclusive translation with a well-founded framework. This paper presents FairTranslate, a novel, fully human-annotated dataset designed to evaluate non-binary gender biases in machine translation systems from English to French. FairTranslate includes 2418 English-French sentence pairs related to occupations, annotated with rich metadata such as the stereotypical alignment of the occupation, grammatical gender indicator ambiguity, and the ground-truth gender label (male, female, or inclusive). We evaluate four leading LLMs (Gemma2-2B, Mistral-7B, Llama3.1-8B, Llama3.3-70B) on this dataset under different prompting procedures. Our results reveal substantial biases in gender representation across LLMs, highlighting persistent challenges in achieving equitable outcomes in machine translation. These findings underscore the need for focused strategies and interventions aimed at ensuring fair and inclusive language usage in LLM-based translation systems. We make the FairTranslate dataset publicly available on Hugging Face, and disclose the code for all experiments on GitHub.</p></details> | FAccT 2025 |
| **[Optimizing RLHF Training for Large Language Models with Stage Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13221v3)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present RLHFuse, an efficient training system with stage fusion for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Due to the intrinsic nature of RLHF training, i.e., the data skewness in the generation stage and the pipeline bubbles in the training stage, existing RLHF systems suffer from low GPU utilization. RLHFuse breaks the traditional view of RLHF workflow as a composition of individual tasks, splitting each task into finer-grained subtasks, and performing stage fusion to improve GPU utilization. RLHFuse contains two key ideas. First, for generation and inference tasks, RLHFuse splits them into sample-level subtasks, enabling efficient inter-stage fusion to overlap the execution of generation and inference stages, thus mitigating the original generation bottleneck dominated by long-tailed samples. Second, for training tasks, RLHFuse breaks them into subtasks of micro-batches and performs intra-stage fusion to concurrently execute these subtasks in the training stage with a fused pipeline schedule, effectively mitigating the pipeline bubbles. The experiments show that RLHFuse increases the training throughput by up to $3.7\times$, compared to existing systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning Physical Video Generation with Diffusion Timestep Tokens via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15932v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent progress in video generation, producing videos that adhere to physical laws remains a significant challenge. Traditional diffusion-based methods struggle to extrapolate to unseen physical conditions (eg, velocity) due to their reliance on data-driven approximations. To address this, we propose to integrate symbolic reasoning and reinforcement learning to enforce physical consistency in video generation. We first introduce the Diffusion Timestep Tokenizer (DDT), which learns discrete, recursive visual tokens by recovering visual attributes lost during the diffusion process. The recursive visual tokens enable symbolic reasoning by a large language model. Based on it, we propose the Phys-AR framework, which consists of two stages: The first stage uses supervised fine-tuning to transfer symbolic knowledge, while the second stage applies reinforcement learning to optimize the model's reasoning abilities through reward functions based on physical conditions. Our approach allows the model to dynamically adjust and improve the physical properties of generated videos, ensuring adherence to physical laws. Experimental results demonstrate that PhysAR can generate videos that are physically consistent.</p></details> |  |
| **[StreamRL: Scalable, Heterogeneous, and Elastic RL for LLMs with Disaggregated Stream Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15930v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has become the core post-training technique for large language models (LLMs). RL for LLMs involves two stages: generation and training. The LLM first generates samples online, which are then used to derive rewards for training. The conventional view holds that the colocated architecture, where the two stages share resources via temporal multiplexing, outperforms the disaggregated architecture, in which dedicated resources are assigned to each stage. However, in real-world deployments, we observe that the colocated architecture suffers from resource coupling, where the two stages are constrained to use the same resources. This coupling compromises the scalability and cost-efficiency of colocated RL in large-scale training. In contrast, the disaggregated architecture allows for flexible resource allocation, supports heterogeneous training setups, and facilitates cross-datacenter deployment. StreamRL is designed with disaggregation from first principles and fully unlocks its potential by addressing two types of performance bottlenecks in existing disaggregated RL frameworks: pipeline bubbles, caused by stage dependencies, and skewness bubbles, resulting from long-tail output length distributions. To address pipeline bubbles, StreamRL breaks the traditional stage boundary in synchronous RL algorithms through stream generation and achieves full overlapping in asynchronous RL. To address skewness bubbles, StreamRL employs an output-length ranker model to identify long-tail samples and reduces generation time via skewness-aware dispatching and scheduling. Experiments show that StreamRL improves throughput by up to 2.66x compared to existing state-of-the-art systems, and improves cost-effectiveness by up to 1.33x in a heterogeneous, cross-datacenter setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Unifying Evaluation of Counterfactual Explanations: Leveraging Large Language Models for Human-Centric Assessments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21131v3)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As machine learning models evolve, maintaining transparency demands more human-centric explainable AI techniques. Counterfactual explanations, with roots in human reasoning, identify the minimal input changes needed to obtain a given output and, hence, are crucial for supporting decision-making. Despite their importance, the evaluation of these explanations often lacks grounding in user studies and remains fragmented, with existing metrics not fully capturing human perspectives. To address this challenge, we developed a diverse set of 30 counterfactual scenarios and collected ratings across 8 evaluation metrics from 206 respondents. Subsequently, we fine-tuned different Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict average or individual human judgment across these metrics. Our methodology allowed LLMs to achieve an accuracy of up to 63% in zero-shot evaluations and 85% (over a 3-classes prediction) with fine-tuning across all metrics. The fine-tuned models predicting human ratings offer better comparability and scalability in evaluating different counterfactual explanation frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper extends the AAAI-2025 version by including the Appendix</p></details> |
| **[Understanding LLM Behaviors via Compression: Data Generation, Knowledge Acquisition and Scaling Laws](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09597v4)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across numerous tasks, yet principled explanations for their underlying mechanisms and several phenomena, such as scaling laws, hallucinations, and related behaviors, remain elusive. In this work, we revisit the classical relationship between compression and prediction, grounded in Kolmogorov complexity and Shannon information theory, to provide deeper insights into LLM behaviors. By leveraging the Kolmogorov Structure Function and interpreting LLM compression as a two-part coding process, we offer a detailed view of how LLMs acquire and store information across increasing model and data scales -- from pervasive syntactic patterns to progressively rarer knowledge elements. Motivated by this theoretical perspective and natural assumptions inspired by Heap's and Zipf's laws, we introduce a simplified yet representative hierarchical data-generation framework called the Syntax-Knowledge model. Under the Bayesian setting, we show that prediction and compression within this model naturally lead to diverse learning and scaling behaviors of LLMs. In particular, our theoretical analysis offers intuitive and principled explanations for both data and model scaling laws, the dynamics of knowledge acquisition during training and fine-tuning, factual knowledge hallucinations in LLMs. The experimental results validate our theoretical predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Test Generation from Task Description for Mobile Testing with Multi-modal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15917v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Android GUI testing, generating an action sequence for a task that can be replayed as a test script is common. Generating sequences of actions and respective test scripts from task goals described in natural language can eliminate the need for manually writing test scripts. However, existing approaches based on large language models (LLM) often struggle with identifying the final action, and either end prematurely or continue past the final screen. In this paper, we introduce VisiDroid, a multi-modal, LLM-based, multi-agent framework that iteratively determines the next action and leverages visual images of screens to detect the task's completeness. The multi-modal approach enhances our model in two significant ways. First, this approach enables it to avoid prematurely terminating a task when textual content alone provides misleading indications of task completion. Additionally, visual input helps the tool avoid errors when changes in the GUI do not directly affect functionality toward task completion, such as adjustments to font sizes or colors. Second, the multi-modal approach also ensures the tool not progress beyond the final screen, which might lack explicit textual indicators of task completion but could display a visual element indicating task completion, which is common in GUI apps. Our evaluation shows that VisiDroid achieves an accuracy of 87.3%, outperforming the best baseline relatively by 23.5%. We also demonstrate that our multi-modal framework with images and texts enables the LLM to better determine when a task is completed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review for a conference</p></details> |
| **[Automated Bug Report Prioritization in Large Open-Source Projects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15912v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large open-source projects receive a large number of issues (known as bugs), including software defect (i.e., bug) reports and new feature requests from their user and developer communities at a fast rate. The often limited project resources do not allow them to deal with all issues. Instead, they have to prioritize them according to the project's priorities and the issues' severities. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to automated bug prioritization based on the natural language text of the bug reports that are stored in the open bug repositories of the issue-tracking systems. We conduct topic modeling using a variant of LDA called TopicMiner-MTM and text classification with the BERT large language model to achieve a higher performance level compared to the state-of-the-art. Experimental results using an existing reference dataset containing 85,156 bug reports of the Eclipse Platform project indicate that we outperform existing approaches in terms of Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-measure of the bug report priority prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[AI Predicts AGI: Leveraging AGI Forecasting and Peer Review to Explore LLMs' Complex Reasoning Capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09385v2)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We tasked 16 state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) with estimating the likelihood of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) emerging by 2030. To assess the quality of these forecasts, we implemented an automated peer review process (LLM-PR). The LLMs' estimates varied widely, ranging from 3% (Reka- Core) to 47.6% (GPT-4o), with a median of 12.5%. These estimates closely align with a recent expert survey that projected a 10% likelihood of AGI by 2027, underscoring the relevance of LLMs in forecasting complex, speculative scenarios. The LLM-PR process demonstrated strong reliability, evidenced by a high Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC = 0.79), reflecting notable consistency in scoring across the models. Among the models, Pplx-70b-online emerged as the top performer, while Gemini-1.5-pro-api ranked the lowest. A cross-comparison with external benchmarks, such as LMSYS Chatbot Arena, revealed that LLM rankings remained consistent across different evaluation methods, suggesting that existing benchmarks may not encapsulate some of the skills relevant for AGI prediction. We further explored the use of weighting schemes based on external benchmarks, optimizing the alignment of LLMs' predictions with human expert forecasts. This analysis led to the development of a new, 'AGI benchmark' designed to highlight performance differences in AGI-related tasks. Our findings offer insights into LLMs' capabilities in speculative, interdisciplinary forecasting tasks and emphasize the growing need for innovative evaluation frameworks for assessing AI performance in complex, uncertain real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>47 pa...</summary><p>47 pages, 8 figures, 17 tables, appendix with data and code</p></details> |

By synergizing retrieval mechanisms with advanced reasoning, LLMs can now tackle increasingly complex problems. This paper presents a systematic review of the collaborative interplay between RAG and reasoning, clearly defining "reasoning" within the RAG context. It construct a comprehensive taxonomy encompassing multi-dimensional collaborative objectives, representative paradigms, and technical implementations, and analyze the bidirectional synergy methods. Additionally, we critically evaluate current limitations in RAG assessment, including the absence of intermediate supervision for multi-step reasoning and practical challenges related to cost-risk trade-offs. To bridge theory and practice, we provide practical guidelines tailored to diverse real-world applications. Finally, we identify promising research directions, such as graph-based knowledge integration, hybrid model collaboration, and RL-driven optimization. Overall, this work presents a theoretical framework and practical foundation to advance RAG systems in academia and industry, fostering the next generation of RAG solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Impact of Noise on LLM-Models Performance in Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) Tasks with Model Temperature Considerations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15903v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have generated growing interest in their structured reasoning capabilities, particularly in tasks involving abstraction and pattern recognition. The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark plays a crucial role in evaluating these capabilities by testing how well AI models generalize to novel problems. While GPT-4o demonstrates strong performance by solving all ARC tasks under zero-noise conditions, other models like DeepSeek R1 and LLaMA 3.2 fail to solve any, suggesting limitations in their ability to reason beyond simple pattern matching. To explore this gap, we systematically evaluate these models across different noise levels and temperature settings. Our results reveal that the introduction of noise consistently impairs model performance, regardless of architecture. This decline highlights a shared vulnerability: current LLMs, despite showing signs of abstract reasoning, remain highly sensitive to input perturbations. Such fragility raises concerns about their real-world applicability, where noise and uncertainty are common. By comparing how different model architectures respond to these challenges, we offer insights into the structural weaknesses of modern LLMs in reasoning tasks. This work underscores the need for developing more robust and adaptable AI systems capable of handling the ambiguity and variability inherent in real-world scenarios. Our findings aim to guide future research toward enhancing model generalization, robustness, and alignment with human-like cognitive flexibility.</p></details> | 60 pages, 25 figures |

Yet whether and how these gains transfer to audio-language reasoning remains largely unexplored. We extend the Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework from DeepSeek-R1 to a Large Audio-Language Model (LALM), and construct a 32k sample multiple-choice corpus. Using a two-stage regimen supervised fine-tuning on structured and unstructured chains-of-thought, followed by curriculum-guided GRPO, we systematically compare implicit vs. explicit, and structured vs. free form reasoning under identical architectures. Our structured audio reasoning model, SARI (Structured Audio Reasoning via Curriculum-Guided Reinforcement Learning), achieves a 16.35% improvement in average accuracy over the base model Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct. Furthermore, the variant built upon Qwen2.5-Omni reaches state-of-the-art performance of 67.08% on the MMAU test-mini benchmark. Ablation experiments show that on the base model we use: (i) SFT warm-up is important for stable RL training, (ii) structured chains yield more robust generalization than unstructured ones, and (iii) easy-to-hard curricula accelerate convergence and improve final performance. These findings demonstrate that explicit, structured reasoning and curriculum learning substantially enhances audio-language understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time's Up! An Empirical Study of LLM Reasoning Ability Under Output Length Constraint](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14350v2)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has demonstrated the remarkable potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in test-time scaling. By making the models think before answering, they are able to achieve much higher accuracy with extra inference computation. However, in many real-world scenarios, models are used under time constraints, where an answer should be given to the user within a certain output length. It is unclear whether and how the reasoning abilities of LLMs remain effective under such constraints. We take a first look at this problem by conducting an in-depth empirical study. Specifically, we test more than 25 LLMs on common reasoning datasets under a wide range of output length budgets, and we analyze the correlation between the inference accuracy and various properties including model type, model size, prompt style, etc. We also consider the mappings between the token budgets and the actual on-device latency budgets. The results have demonstrated several interesting findings regarding the budget-aware LLM reasoning that differ from the unconstrained situation, e.g. the optimal choices of model sizes and prompts change under different budgets. These findings offer practical guidance for users to deploy LLMs under real-world latency constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Cognitive and Aesthetic Causality for Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15848v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal aspect-based sentiment classification (MASC) is an emerging task due to an increase in user-generated multimodal content on social platforms, aimed at predicting sentiment polarity toward specific aspect targets (i.e., entities or attributes explicitly mentioned in text-image pairs). Despite extensive efforts and significant achievements in existing MASC, substantial gaps remain in understanding fine-grained visual content and the cognitive rationales derived from semantic content and impressions (cognitive interpretations of emotions evoked by image content). In this study, we present Chimera: a cognitive and aesthetic sentiment causality understanding framework to derive fine-grained holistic features of aspects and infer the fundamental drivers of sentiment expression from both semantic perspectives and affective-cognitive resonance (the synergistic effect between emotional responses and cognitive interpretations). Specifically, this framework first incorporates visual patch features for patch-word alignment. Meanwhile, it extracts coarse-grained visual features (e.g., overall image representation) and fine-grained visual regions (e.g., aspect-related regions) and translates them into corresponding textual descriptions (e.g., facial, aesthetic). Finally, we leverage the sentimental causes and impressions generated by a large language model (LLM) to enhance the model's awareness of sentimental cues evoked by semantic content and affective-cognitive resonance. Experimental results on standard MASC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, which also exhibits greater flexibility to MASC compared to LLMs such as GPT-4o. We have publicly released the complete implementation and dataset at https://github.com/Xillv/Chimera</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TAFFC 2025</p></details> |

We find that during DPO training, the reference model plays the role of a data weight adjuster. However, the common practice of initializing the policy and reference models identically in DPO can lead to inefficient data utilization and impose a performance ceiling. Meanwhile, the lack of a reference model in Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO) reduces training robustness and necessitates stricter conditions to prevent catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we propose Pre-DPO, a simple yet effective DPO-based training paradigm that enhances preference optimization performance by leveraging a guiding reference model. This reference model provides foresight into the optimal policy state achievable through the training preference data, serving as a guiding mechanism that adaptively assigns higher weights to samples more suitable for the model and lower weights to those less suitable. Extensive experiments on AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard v0.1 benchmarks demonstrate that Pre-DPO consistently improves the performance of both DPO and SimPO, without relying on external models or additional data.</p></details> |  |

However, the need for linguistic data is not applicable to all practical tasks. In this study, we aim to explore using large vision models (LVMs) or visual foundation models (VFMs) to enhance long-tailed data features without any language information. Specifically, we extract features from the LVM and fuse them with features in the baseline network's map and latent space to obtain the augmented features. Moreover, we design several prototype-based losses in the latent space to further exploit the potential of the augmented features. In the experimental section, we validate our approach on two benchmark datasets: ImageNet-LT and iNaturalist2018.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we first empirically demonstrate the instability and suboptimal performance of existing popular MU methods when deployed in different scenarios. To address this issue, we propose Dual Optimizer (DualOptim), which incorporates adaptive learning rate and decoupled momentum factors. Empirical and theoretical evidence demonstrates that DualOptim contributes to effective and stable unlearning. Through extensive experiments, we show that DualOptim can significantly boost MU efficacy and stability across diverse tasks, including image classification, image generation, and large language models, making it a versatile approach to empower existing MU algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Game theory offers powerful models to capture and interpret strategic interaction among agents, but requires the support of reproducible, standardized and user-friendly IT frameworks to enable comparison and interpretation of results. To this end, we present FAIRGAME, a Framework for AI Agents Bias Recognition using Game Theory. We describe its implementation and usage, and we employ it to uncover biased outcomes in popular games among AI agents, depending on the employed Large Language Model (LLM) and used language, as well as on the personality trait or strategic knowledge of the agents. Overall, FAIRGAME allows users to reliably and easily simulate their desired games and scenarios and compare the results across simulation campaigns and with game-theoretic predictions, enabling the systematic discovery of biases, the anticipation of emerging behavior out of strategic interplays, and empowering further research into strategic decision-making using LLM agents.</p></details> |  |

Supporting Users in Identifying the Effects of Prompt and Model Changes Through Token Patterns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15815v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt engineering for large language models is challenging, as even small prompt perturbations or model changes can significantly impact the generated output texts. Existing evaluation methods, either automated metrics or human evaluation, have limitations, such as providing limited insights or being labor-intensive. We propose Spotlight, a new approach that combines both automation and human analysis. Based on data mining techniques, we automatically distinguish between random (decoding) variations and systematic differences in language model outputs. This process provides token patterns that describe the systematic differences and guide the user in manually analyzing the effects of their prompt and model changes efficiently. We create three benchmarks to quantitatively test the reliability of token pattern extraction methods and demonstrate that our approach provides new insights into established prompt data. From a human-centric perspective, through demonstration studies and a user study, we show that our token pattern approach helps users understand the systematic differences of language model outputs, and we are able to discover relevant differences caused by prompt and model changes (e.g. related to gender or culture), thus supporting the prompt engineering process and human-centric model behavior research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Insights from Verification: Training a Verilog Generation LLM with Reinforcement Learning with Testbench Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15804v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in Verilog generation from natural language description. However, ensuring the functional correctness of the generated code remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a method that integrates verification insights from testbench into the training of Verilog generation LLMs, aligning the training with the fundamental goal of hardware design: functional correctness. The main obstacle in using LLMs for Verilog code generation is the lack of sufficient functional verification data, particularly testbenches paired with design specifications and code. To address this problem, we introduce an automatic testbench generation pipeline that decomposes the process and uses feedback from the Verilog compiler simulator (VCS) to reduce hallucination and ensure correctness. We then use the testbench to evaluate the generated codes and collect them for further training, where verification insights are introduced. Our method applies reinforcement learning (RL), specifically direct preference optimization (DPO), to align Verilog code generation with functional correctness by training preference pairs based on testbench outcomes. In evaluations on VerilogEval-Machine, VerilogEval-Human, RTLLM v1.1, RTLLM v2, and VerilogEval v2, our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in generating functionally correct Verilog code. We open source all training code, data, and models at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/VeriPrefer-E88B.</p></details> |  |
| **[A closer look at how large language models trust humans: patterns and biases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15801v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents increasingly interact with humans in decision-making contexts, understanding the trust dynamics between humans and AI agents becomes a central concern. While considerable literature studies how humans trust AI agents, it is much less understood how LLM-based agents develop effective trust in humans. LLM-based agents likely rely on some sort of implicit effective trust in trust-related contexts (e.g., evaluating individual loan applications) to assist and affect decision making. Using established behavioral theories, we develop an approach that studies whether LLMs trust depends on the three major trustworthiness dimensions: competence, benevolence and integrity of the human subject. We also study how demographic variables affect effective trust. Across 43,200 simulated experiments, for five popular language models, across five different scenarios we find that LLM trust development shows an overall similarity to human trust development. We find that in most, but not all cases, LLM trust is strongly predicted by trustworthiness, and in some cases also biased by age, religion and gender, especially in financial scenarios. This is particularly true for scenarios common in the literature and for newer models. While the overall patterns align with human-like mechanisms of effective trust formation, different models exhibit variation in how they estimate trust; in some cases, trustworthiness and demographic factors are weak predictors of effective trust. These findings call for a better understanding of AI-to-human trust dynamics and monitoring of biases and trust development patterns to prevent unintended and potentially harmful outcomes in trust-sensitive applications of AI.</p></details> |  |

Retrieving this information correctly is essential in financial Question-Answering (QA), since many language models struggle with factual accuracy in this domain. We present FinDER, an expert-generated dataset tailored for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in finance. Unlike existing QA datasets that provide predefined contexts and rely on relatively clear and straightforward queries, FinDER focuses on annotating search-relevant evidence by domain experts, offering 5,703 query-evidence-answer triplets derived from real-world financial inquiries. These queries frequently include abbreviations, acronyms, and concise expressions, capturing the brevity and ambiguity common in the realistic search behavior of professionals. By challenging models to retrieve relevant information from large corpora rather than relying on readily determined contexts, FinDER offers a more realistic benchmark for evaluating RAG systems. We further present a comprehensive evaluation of multiple state-of-the-art retrieval models and Large Language Models, showcasing challenges derived from a realistic benchmark to drive future research on truthful and precise RAG in the financial domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, ICLR 2025 Workshop Advances in Financial AI</p></details> |

Their potential to facilitate human coordination with many agents is a promising but largely under-explored area. Such capabilities would be helpful in disaster response, urban planning, and real-time strategy scenarios. In this work, we introduce (1) a real-time strategy game benchmark designed to evaluate these abilities and (2) a novel framework we term HIVE. HIVE empowers a single human to coordinate swarms of up to 2,000 agents through a natural language dialog with an LLM. We present promising results on this multi-agent benchmark, with our hybrid approach solving tasks such as coordinating agent movements, exploiting unit weaknesses, leveraging human annotations, and understanding terrain and strategic points. Our findings also highlight critical limitations of current models, including difficulties in processing spatial visual information and challenges in formulating long-term strategic plans.

However, existing methods have not fully capitalized on the potential of LLMs, often constrained by limited input information or failing to fully utilize their advanced reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce EXP3RT, a novel LLM-based recommender designed to leverage rich preference information contained in user and item reviews. EXP3RT is basically fine-tuned through distillation from a teacher LLM to perform three key tasks in order: EXP3RT first extracts and encapsulates essential subjective preferences from raw reviews, aggregates and summarizes them according to specific criteria to create user and item profiles. It then generates detailed step-by-step reasoning followed by predicted rating, i.e., reasoning-enhanced rating prediction, by considering both subjective and objective information from user/item profiles and item descriptions. This personalized preference reasoning from EXP3RT enhances rating prediction accuracy and also provides faithful and reasonable explanations for recommendation. Extensive experiments show that EXP3RT outperforms existing methods on both rating prediction and candidate item reranking for top-k recommendation, while significantly enhancing the explainability of recommendation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

Through comprehensive evaluations of two widely used benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our method improves the F1 score compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, we explore the potential of using prompts within these models for unsupervised concept extraction.

How can world models benefit LLM agents? The gap between the prior knowledge of LLMs and the specified environment's dynamics usually bottlenecks LLMs' performance as world models. To bridge the gap, we propose a training-free "world alignment" that learns an environment's symbolic knowledge complementary to LLMs. The symbolic knowledge covers action rules, knowledge graphs, and scene graphs, which are extracted by LLMs from exploration trajectories and encoded into executable codes to regulate LLM agents' policies. We further propose an RL-free, model-based agent "WALL-E 2.0" through the model-predictive control (MPC) framework. Unlike classical MPC requiring costly optimization on the fly, we adopt an LLM agent as an efficient look-ahead optimizer of future steps' actions by interacting with the neurosymbolic world model. While the LLM agent's strong heuristics make it an efficient planner in MPC, the quality of its planned actions is also secured by the accurate predictions of the aligned world model. They together considerably improve learning efficiency in a new environment. On open-world challenges in Mars (Minecraft like) and ALFWorld (embodied indoor environments), WALL-E 2.0 significantly outperforms existing methods, e.g., surpassing baselines in Mars by 16.1%-51.6% of success rate and by at least 61.7% in score. In ALFWorld, it achieves a new record 98% success rate after only 4 iterations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/elated-sawyer/WALL-E</p></details> |

However, evaluating the creativity of machine-generated texts remains a significant challenge, as existing methods either rely on costly manual annotations or fail to align closely with human assessments. In this paper, we propose an effective automated evaluation method based on the Torrance Test of Creative Writing (TTCW), which evaluates creativity as product. Our method employs a reference-based Likert-style approach, scoring generated creative texts relative to high-quality reference texts across various tests. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the alignment between LLM evaluations and human assessments, achieving a pairwise accuracy of 0.75 (+15\%).</p></details> |  |

Despite the fast development of large language models in general problem solving, it remains unresolved regarding with both methodology and benchmarks, especially given the fact that exiting synthetic GPS benchmarks are often not self-verified and contain noise and self-contradicted information due to the illusion of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a scalable data engine called TrustGeoGen for problem generation, with formal verification to provide a principled benchmark, which we believe lays the foundation for the further development of methods for GPS. The engine synthesizes geometric data through four key innovations: 1) multimodal-aligned generation of diagrams, textual descriptions, and stepwise solutions; 2) formal verification ensuring rule-compliant reasoning paths; 3) a bootstrapping mechanism enabling complexity escalation via recursive state generation and 4) our devised GeoExplore series algorithms simultaneously produce multi-solution variants and self-reflective backtracking traces. By formal logical verification, TrustGeoGen produces GeoTrust-200K dataset with guaranteed modality integrity, along with GeoTrust-test testset. Experiments reveal the state-of-the-art models achieve only 49.17\% accuracy on GeoTrust-test, demonstrating its evaluation stringency. Crucially, models trained on GeoTrust achieve OOD generalization on GeoQA, significantly reducing logical inconsistencies relative to pseudo-label annotated by OpenAI-o1.

However, replicating these advancements across diverse domains remains challenging due to limited methodological transparency. In this work, we present two-Staged history-Resampling Policy Optimization (SRPO), which surpasses the performance of DeepSeek-R1-Zero-32B on the AIME24 and LiveCodeBench benchmarks. SRPO achieves this using the same base model as DeepSeek (i.e. Qwen2.5-32B), using only about 1/10 of the training steps required by DeepSeek-R1-Zero-32B, demonstrating superior efficiency. Building upon Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), we introduce two key methodological innovations: (1) a two-stage cross-domain training paradigm designed to balance the development of mathematical reasoning and coding proficiency, and (2) History Resampling (HR), a technique to address ineffective samples. Our comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, offering valuable insights into scaling LLM reasoning capabilities across diverse tasks.</p></details> |  |

Block Floating Point (BFP) quantisation reduces memory and computational overhead by converting high-overhead floating point operations into low-bit fixed point operations. However, BFP requires aligning all data to the maximum exponent, which causes loss of small and moderate values, resulting in quantisation error and degradation in the accuracy of LLMs. To address this issue, we propose a Bidirectional Block Floating Point (BBFP) data format, which reduces the probability of selecting the maximum as shared exponent, thereby reducing quantisation error. By utilizing the features in BBFP, we present a full-stack Bidirectional Block Floating Point-Based Quantisation Accelerator for LLMs (BBAL), primarily comprising a processing element array based on BBFP, paired with proposed cost-effective nonlinear computation unit. Experimental results show BBAL achieves a 22% improvement in accuracy compared to an outlier-aware accelerator at similar efficiency, and a 40% efficiency improvement over a BFP-based accelerator at similar accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Serving each LLM with dedicated GPUs leads to resource waste and service inefficiency due to the varying demand of LLM requests. A common practice is to share multiple LLMs. However, existing sharing systems either do not consider the autoregressive pattern of LLM services, or only focus on improving the throughput, which impairs the sharing performance, especially the serving latency. We present SeaLLM, which enables service-aware and latency-optimized LLM sharing. SeaLLM improves the overall sharing performance by (1) a latency-optimized scheduling algorithm utilizing the characteristics of LLM services, (2) a placement algorithm to determine the placement plan and an adaptive replacement algorithm to decide the replacement interval, and (3) a unified key-value cache to share GPU memory among LLM services efficiently. Our evaluation under real-world traces and LLM services demonstrates that SeaLLM improves the normalized latency by up to $13.60\times$, the tail latency by up to $18.69\times$, and the SLO attainment by up to $3.64\times$ compared to existing solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Implementing Rational Choice Functions with LLMs and Measuring their Alignment with User Preferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15719v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) become integral to intelligent user interfaces (IUIs), their role as decision-making agents raises critical concerns about alignment. Although extensive research has addressed issues such as factuality, bias, and toxicity, comparatively little attention has been paid to measuring alignment to preferences, i.e., the relative desirability of different alternatives, a concept used in decision making, economics, and social choice theory. However, a reliable decision-making agent makes choices that align well with user preferences. In this paper, we generalize existing methods that exploit LLMs for ranking alternative outcomes by addressing alignment with the broader and more flexible concept of user preferences, which includes both strict preferences and indifference among alternatives. To this end, we put forward design principles for using LLMs to implement rational choice functions, and provide the necessary tools to measure preference satisfaction. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach through an empirical study in a practical application of an IUI in the automotive domain.</p></details> |  |

We propose DianJin-R1, a reasoning-enhanced framework designed to address these challenges through reasoning-augmented supervision and reinforcement learning. Central to our approach is DianJin-R1-Data, a high-quality dataset constructed from CFLUE, FinQA, and a proprietary compliance corpus (Chinese Compliance Check, CCC), combining diverse financial reasoning scenarios with verified annotations. Our models, DianJin-R1-7B and DianJin-R1-32B, are fine-tuned from Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct using a structured format that generates both reasoning steps and final answers. To further refine reasoning quality, we apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning method that incorporates dual reward signals: one encouraging structured outputs and another rewarding answer correctness. We evaluate our models on five benchmarks: three financial datasets (CFLUE, FinQA, and CCC) and two general reasoning benchmarks (MATH-500 and GPQA-Diamond). Experimental results show that DianJin-R1 models consistently outperform their non-reasoning counterparts, especially on complex financial tasks. Moreover, on the real-world CCC dataset, our single-call reasoning models match or even surpass the performance of multi-agent systems that require significantly more computational cost. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of DianJin-R1 in enhancing financial reasoning through structured supervision and reward-aligned learning, offering a scalable and practical solution for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

On the other hand, the integration of additional image modality may allow the malicious users to inject harmful content inside the images for jailbreaking. Unlike text-based LLMs, where adversaries need to select discrete tokens to conceal their malicious intent using specific algorithms, the continuous nature of image signals provides a direct opportunity for adversaries to inject harmful intentions. In this work, we propose $\textbf{BaThe}$ ($\textbf{Ba}$ckdoor $\textbf{T}$rigger S$\textbf{h}$i$\textbf{e}$ld), a simple yet effective jailbreak defense mechanism. Our work is motivated by recent research on jailbreak backdoor attack and virtual prompt backdoor attack in generative language models. Jailbreak backdoor attack uses harmful instructions combined with manually crafted strings as triggers to make the backdoored model generate prohibited responses. We assume that harmful instructions can function as triggers, and if we alternatively set rejection responses as the triggered response, the backdoored model then can defend against jailbreak attacks. We achieve this by utilizing virtual rejection prompt, similar to the virtual prompt backdoor attack. We embed the virtual rejection prompt into the soft text embeddings, which we call ``wedge''. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that BaThe effectively mitigates various types of jailbreak attacks and is adaptable to defend against unseen attacks, with minimal impact on MLLMs' performance.</p></details> |  |

However, existing research predominantly concentrates on the security of general large language models, lacking specialized methodologies for establishing safety benchmarks and input moderation tailored to embodied agents. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces a novel input moderation framework, meticulously designed to safeguard embodied agents. This framework encompasses the entire pipeline, including taxonomy definition, dataset curation, moderator architecture, model training, and rigorous evaluation. Notably, we introduce EAsafetyBench, a meticulously crafted safety benchmark engineered to facilitate both the training and stringent assessment of moderators specifically designed for embodied agents. Furthermore, we propose Pinpoint, an innovative prompt-decoupled input moderation scheme that harnesses a masked attention mechanism to effectively isolate and mitigate the influence of functional prompts on moderation tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on diverse benchmark datasets and models validate the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that our methodologies achieve an impressive average detection accuracy of 94.58%, surpassing the performance of existing state-of-the-art techniques, alongside an exceptional moderation processing time of merely 0.002 seconds per instance.</p></details> | 9 pages |

We introduce VocalNet-1B and VocalNet-8B, a series of high-performance, low-latency speech LLMs enabled by a scalable and model-agnostic training framework designed for real-time voice interaction. Central to our contribution is the first application of multi-token prediction (MTP) to speech LLMs. This approach represents a paradigm shift from standard next-token prediction (NTP), offering simultaneous improvements in generation speed and quality. Informed by analysis of MTP's effect on speech generation and experimental comparisons, we designed a straightforward and highly effective MTP implementation. Experiments demonstrate that VocalNet performs on par with mainstream Omni LLMs even with limited training data, and significantly surpasses existing open-source speech LLMs. To foster reproducibility and community advancement, all model weights, inference code, training data, and framework implementations have been made publicly available at https://github.com/SJTU-OmniAgent/VocalNet</p></details> |  |

In the industry, inference services based on LLMs are highly sensitive to cost-performance ratio, prompting the need for improving hardware resource utilization in the inference service. Specifically, vector embedding and retrieval processes take up to 20% of the total latency. Therefore, optimizing the utilization of computational resources in vector embeddings is crucial for enhancing the cost-performance ratio of inference processes, which in turn boosts their product competitiveness.In this paper, we analyze the deployment costs of vector embedding technology in inference services, propose a theoretical formula, and determine through the mathematical expression that increasing the capacity to process concurrent queries is the key to reducing the deployment costs of vector embeddings. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on improving the product's capability to process concurrent queries. To optimize concurrency without sacrificing performance, we have designed a queue manager that adeptly offloads CPU peak queries. This manager utilizes a linear regression model to ascertain the optimal queue depths, a critical parameter that significantly influences the efficacy of the system. We further develop a system named WindVE that uses a CPU-NPU heterogeneous architecture to offload peak concurrent queries, which leverages the performance differences between the two processors to effectively manage traffic surges. Through experiments, we compare WindVE to the state-of-the-art vector embedding framework FlagEmbedding, and achieve a concurrency level up to 22.3% higher than the scheme without offloading.</p></details> |  |
| **[VeriCoder: Enhancing LLM-Based RTL Code Generation through Functional Correctness Validation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15659v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in applying them to Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tasks, particularly Register Transfer Level (RTL) code generation. While several RTL datasets have been introduced, most focus on syntactic validity rather than functional validation with tests, leading to training examples that compile but may not implement the intended behavior. We present VERICODER, a model for RTL code generation fine-tuned on a dataset validated for functional correctness. This fine-tuning dataset is constructed using a novel methodology that combines unit test generation with feedback-directed refinement. Given a natural language specification and an initial RTL design, we prompt a teacher model (GPT-4o-mini) to generate unit tests and iteratively revise the RTL design based on its simulation results using the generated tests. If necessary, the teacher model also updates the tests to ensure they comply with the natural language specification. As a result of this process, every example in our dataset is functionally validated, consisting of a natural language description, an RTL implementation, and passing tests. Fine-tuned on this dataset of over 125,000 examples, VERICODER achieves state-of-the-art metrics in functional correctness on VerilogEval and RTLLM, with relative gains of up to 71.7% and 27.4% respectively. An ablation study further shows that models trained on our functionally validated dataset outperform those trained on functionally non-validated datasets, underscoring the importance of high-quality datasets in RTL code generation.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce Falcon, an innovative semi-autoregressive speculative decoding framework fashioned to augment both the drafter's parallelism and output quality. Falcon incorporates the Coupled Sequential Glancing Distillation technique, which fortifies inter-token dependencies within the same block, leading to increased speculation accuracy. We offer a comprehensive theoretical analysis to illuminate the underlying mechanisms. Additionally, we introduce a Custom-Designed Decoding Tree, which permits the drafter to generate multiple tokens in a single forward pass and accommodates multiple forward passes as needed, thereby boosting the number of drafted tokens and significantly improving the overall acceptance rate. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets such as MT-Bench, HumanEval, and GSM8K demonstrate Falcon's superior acceleration capabilities. The framework achieves a lossless speedup ratio ranging from 2.91x to 3.51x when tested on the Vicuna and LLaMA2-Chat model series. These results outstrip existing speculative decoding methods for LLMs, including Eagle, Medusa, Lookahead, SPS, and PLD, while maintaining a compact drafter architecture equivalent to merely two Transformer layers.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 Accepted |

However, they risk perpetuating societal biases, especially when demographic information is involved. We introduce a novel framework using cosine distance to measure semantic shifts in responses and an LLM-judged Preference Win Rate (WR) to assess how demographic prompts affect response quality across power-disparate social scenarios. Evaluating five LLMs over 100 diverse social scenarios and nine demographic axes, our findings suggest a "default persona" bias toward middle-aged, able-bodied, native-born, Caucasian, atheistic males with centrist views. Moreover, interactions involving specific demographics are associated with lower-quality responses. Lastly, the presence of power disparities increases variability in response semantics and quality across demographic groups, suggesting that implicit biases may be heightened under power-imbalanced conditions. These insights expose the demographic biases inherent in LLMs and offer potential paths toward future bias mitigation efforts in LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>NAACL...</summary><p>NAACL 2025; 10 pages of main text.

To this end, we introduce a new approach for creating a massive, high-quality instruction-tuning dataset, Square-10M, which is generated using closed-source MLLMs. The data construction process, termed Square, consists of four steps: Self-Questioning, Answering, Reasoning, and Evaluation. Our experiments with Square-10M led to three key findings: 1) Our model, TextSquare, considerably surpasses open-source previous state-of-the-art Text-centric MLLMs and sets a new standard on OCRBench(62.2%). It even outperforms top-tier models like GPT4V and Gemini in 6 of 10 text-centric benchmarks. 2) Additionally, we demonstrate the critical role of VQA reasoning data in offering comprehensive contextual insights for specific questions. This not only improves accuracy but also significantly mitigates hallucinations. Specifically, TextSquare scores an average of 75.1% across four general VQA and hallucination evaluation datasets, outperforming previous state-of-the-art models. 3) Notably, the phenomenon observed in scaling text-centric VQA datasets reveals a vivid pattern: the exponential increase of instruction tuning data volume is directly proportional to the improvement in model performance, thereby validating the necessity of the dataset scale and the high quality of Square-10M.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cost-Effective Text Clustering with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15640v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text clustering aims to automatically partition a collection of text documents into distinct clusters based on linguistic features. In the literature, this task is usually framed as metric clustering based on text embeddings from pre-trained encoders or a graph clustering problem upon pairwise similarities from an oracle, e.g., a large ML model. Recently, large language models (LLMs) bring significant advancement in this field by offering contextualized text embeddings and highly accurate similarity scores, but meanwhile, present grand challenges to cope with substantial computational and/or financial overhead caused by numerous API-based queries or inference calls to the models. In response, this paper proposes TECL, a cost-effective framework that taps into the feedback from LLMs for accurate text clustering within a limited budget of queries to LLMs. Under the hood, TECL adopts our EdgeLLM or TriangleLLM to construct must-link/cannot-link constraints for text pairs, and further leverages such constraints as supervision signals input to our weighted constrained clustering approach to generate clusters. Particularly, EdgeLLM (resp. TriangleLLM) enables the identification of informative text pairs (resp. triplets) for querying LLMs via well-thought-out greedy algorithms and accurate extraction of pairwise constraints through carefully-crafted prompting techniques. Our experiments on multiple benchmark datasets exhibit that TECL consistently and considerably outperforms existing solutions in unsupervised text clustering under the same query cost for LLMs.</p></details> |  |

While there is an extensive body of research on detecting data races and a wealth of practical detection tools across various programming languages, considerably less effort has been directed toward automatically fixing data races at an industrial scale. In large codebases, data races are continuously introduced and exhibit myriad patterns, making automated fixing particularly challenging. In this paper, we tackle the problem of automatically fixing data races at an industrial scale. We present Dr.Fix, a tool that combines large language models (LLMs) with program analysis to generate fixes for data races in real-world settings, effectively addressing a broad spectrum of racy patterns in complex code contexts. Implemented for Go--the programming language widely used in modern microservice architectures where concurrency is pervasive and data races are common--Dr.Fix seamlessly integrates into existing development workflows. We detail the design of Dr.Fix and examine how individual design choices influence the quality of the fixes produced. Over the past 18 months, Dr.Fix has been integrated into developer workflows at Uber demonstrating its practical utility. During this period, Dr.Fix produced patches for 224 (55%) from a corpus of 404 data races spanning various categories; 193 of these patches (86%) were accepted by more than a hundred developers via code reviews and integrated into the codebase.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in PLDI 2025</p></details> |

While existing approaches focus on enhancing the decoding strategies, they ignore the fundamental mechanism of how contextual information is processed within LLMs' internal states. As a result, LLMs remain limited in their ability to fully leverage contextual knowledge. In this paper, we propose Context-aware Layer Enhancement (CaLE), a novel intervention method that enhances the utilization of contextual knowledge within LLMs' internal representations. By employing V-usable information analysis, CaLE strategically amplifies the growth of contextual information at an optimal layer, thereby enriching representations in the final layer. Our experiments demonstrate that CaLE effectively improves context-faithful generation in Question-Answering tasks, particularly in scenarios involving unknown or conflicting contextual knowledge.</p></details> |  |

RAG systems combine traditional search capabilities with LLMs to generate comprehensive answers to user queries, ideally with accurate citations. However, in our experience of developing a RAG product, LLMs often struggle with source attribution, aligning with other industry studies reporting citation accuracy rates of only about 74% for popular generative search engines. To address this, we present efficient post-processing algorithms to improve citation accuracy in LLM-generated responses, with minimal impact on latency and cost. Our approaches cross-check generated citations against retrieved articles using methods including keyword + semantic matching, fine tuned model with BERTScore, and a lightweight LLM-based technique. Our experimental results demonstrate a relative improvement of 15.46% in the overall accuracy metrics of our RAG system. This significant enhancement potentially enables a shift from our current larger language model to a relatively smaller model that is approximately 12x more cost-effective and 3x faster in inference time, while maintaining comparable performance. This research contributes to enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of AI-generated content in information retrieval and summarization tasks which is critical to gain customer trust especially in commercial products.</p></details> |  |

However, these general-domain MLLMs perform poorly in face perception tasks, often producing inaccurate or misleading responses to face-specific queries. To address this gap, we propose FaceInsight, the versatile face perception MLLM that provides fine-grained facial information. Our approach introduces visual-textual alignment of facial knowledge to model both uncertain dependencies and deterministic relationships among facial information, mitigating the limitations of language-driven reasoning. Additionally, we incorporate face segmentation maps as an auxiliary perceptual modality, enriching the visual input with localized structural cues to enhance semantic understanding. Comprehensive experiments and analyses across three face perception tasks demonstrate that FaceInsight consistently outperforms nine compared MLLMs under both training-free and fine-tuned settings.</p></details> |  |

Traditional cybersecurity approaches, often based on static rules and predefined scenarios, are struggling to adapt to the rapidly evolving nature of modern cyberattacks. There is an urgent need for more adaptive and intelligent defence strategies. The emergence of Large Language Model (LLM) provides an innovative solution to cope with the increasingly severe cyber threats, and its potential in analysing complex attack patterns, predicting threats and assisting real-time response has attracted a lot of attention in the field of cybersecurity, and exploring how to effectively use LLM to defend against cyberattacks has become a hot topic in the current research field. This survey examines the applications of LLM from the perspective of the cyber attack lifecycle, focusing on the three phases of defense reconnaissance, foothold establishment, and lateral movement, and it analyzes the potential of LLMs in Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) tasks. Meanwhile, we investigate how LLM-based security solutions are deployed and applied in different network scenarios. It also summarizes the internal and external risk issues faced by LLM during its application. Finally, this survey also points out the facing risk issues and possible future research directions in this domain.</p></details> | 20 pages, 3 figures |

However, existing methods focus primarily on language preferences while neglecting the critical visual context. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Vision-enhanced Preference optimization (AdaViP) that addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) vision-based preference pair construction, which integrates multiple visual foundation models to strategically remove key visual elements from the image, enhancing MLLMs' sensitivity to visual details; and (2) adaptive preference optimization that dynamically balances vision- and language-based preferences for more accurate alignment. Extensive evaluations across different benchmarks demonstrate our effectiveness. Notably, our AdaViP-7B achieves 93.7% and 96.4% reductions in response-level and mentioned-level hallucination respectively on the Object HalBench, significantly outperforming current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we closely examine the reasons behind this phenomenon, focusing on the pre-training corpus. We find that the existence of code-switching, alternating between different languages within a context, is key to multilingual capabilities. We conduct an analysis to investigate code-switching in the pre-training corpus, examining its presence and categorizing it into four types within two quadrants. We then assess its impact on multilingual performance. These types of code-switching data are unbalanced in proportions and demonstrate different effects on facilitating language transfer. To better explore the power of code-switching for language alignment during pre-training, we investigate the strategy of synthetic code-switching. We continuously scale up the synthetic code-switching data and observe remarkable improvements in both benchmarks and representation space. Extensive experiments indicate that incorporating synthetic code-switching data enables better language alignment and generalizes well to high, medium, and low-resource languages with pre-training corpora of varying qualities.</p></details> |  |

With the Mistral-7B-Instruct model applied with a Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method and a 4-bit quantization method, the model underwent training in two distinct stages related to this study's purpose to enhance domain specificity while maintaining computational efficiency. In Phase 1, the model was conditioned with a synthetic dataset via the Gemini Pro API, and in Phase 2, it was trained with manually curated datasets from the StudyAbroadGPT project to achieve enhanced, contextualized responses. Technical innovations entailed memory-efficient quantization, parameter-efficient adaptation, and continuous training analytics via Weights & Biases. After training, this study demonstrated a reduction in training loss by 52.7%, 92% accuracy in domain-specific recommendations, achieved 95% markdown-based formatting support, and a median run-rate of 100 samples per second on off-the-shelf GPU equipment. These findings support the effective application of instruction-tuned LLMs within educational advisers, especially in low-resource institutional scenarios. Limitations included decreased generalizability and the application of a synthetically generated dataset, but this framework is scalable for adding new multilingual-augmented and real-time academic advising processes.

Traditional navigation approaches relying on pre-built maps or reinforcement learning exhibit limitations such as poor generalization and limited adaptability to dynamic environments. In contrast, LLMs offer a novel paradigm for complex indoor navigation tasks by leveraging their exceptional semantic comprehension, reasoning capabilities, and zero-shot generalization properties. We propose an LLM-based navigation framework that leverages function calling capabilities, positioning the LLM as the central controller. Our methodology involves modular decomposition of conventional navigation functions into reusable LLM tools with expandable configurations. This is complemented by a systematically designed, transferable system prompt template and interaction workflow that can be easily adapted across different implementations. Experimental validation in PyBullet simulation environments across diverse scenarios demonstrates the substantial potential and effectiveness of our approach, particularly in achieving context-aware navigation through dynamic tool composition.</p></details> |  |

With the success of large language models (LLMs), they have been employed in various tasks, including serving as judges (LLM-as-a-judge). In this paper, we reassess the performance of QA models using LLM-as-a-judge across four reading comprehension QA datasets. We examine different families of LLMs and various answer types to evaluate the effectiveness of LLM-as-a-judge in these tasks. Our results show that LLM-as-a-judge is highly correlated with human judgments and can replace traditional EM/F1 metrics. By using LLM-as-a-judge, the correlation with human judgments improves significantly, from 0.22 (EM) and 0.40 (F1-score) to 0.85. These findings confirm that EM and F1 metrics underestimate the true performance of the QA models. While LLM-as-a-judge is not perfect for more difficult answer types (e.g., job), it still outperforms EM/F1, and we observe no bias issues, such as self-preference, when the same model is used for both the QA and judgment tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages; code and data are available at https://github.com/Alab-NII/llm-judge-extract-qa</p></details> |
| **[A Comprehensive Survey in LLM(-Agent) Full Stack Safety: Data, Training and Deployment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15585v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has illuminated a promising pathway toward achieving Artificial General Intelligence for both academic and industrial communities, owing to their unprecedented performance across various applications. As LLMs continue to gain prominence in both research and commercial domains, their security and safety implications have become a growing concern, not only for researchers and corporations but also for every nation. Currently, existing surveys on LLM safety primarily focus on specific stages of the LLM lifecycle, e.g., deployment phase or fine-tuning phase, lacking a comprehensive understanding of the entire "lifechain" of LLMs. To address this gap, this paper introduces, for the first time, the concept of "full-stack" safety to systematically consider safety issues throughout the entire process of LLM training, deployment, and eventual commercialization. Compared to the off-the-shelf LLM safety surveys, our work demonstrates several distinctive advantages: (I) Comprehensive Perspective. We define the complete LLM lifecycle as encompassing data preparation, pre-training, post-training, deployment and final commercialization. To our knowledge, this represents the first safety survey to encompass the entire lifecycle of LLMs. (II) Extensive Literature Support. Our research is grounded in an exhaustive review of over 800+ papers, ensuring comprehensive coverage and systematic organization of security issues within a more holistic understanding. (III) Unique Insights. Through systematic literature analysis, we have developed reliable roadmaps and perspectives for each chapter. Our work identifies promising research directions, including safety in data generation, alignment techniques, model editing, and LLM-based agent systems. These insights provide valuable guidance for researchers pursuing future work in this field.</p></details> |  |

Fine-tuning large models for every niche application is often infeasible due to black-box constraints and high computational overhead. To address this, we propose a collaborative framework that pairs a specialized weak model with a general strong model. The weak model, tailored to specific domains, produces initial drafts and background information, while the strong model leverages its advanced reasoning to refine these drafts, extending LLMs' capabilities to critical yet specialized tasks. To optimize this collaboration, we introduce a collaborative feedback to fine-tunes the weak model, which quantifies the influence of the weak model's contributions in the collaboration procedure and establishes preference pairs to guide preference tuning of the weak model. We validate our framework through experiments on three domains. We find that the collaboration significantly outperforms each model alone by leveraging complementary strengths. Moreover, aligning the weak model with the collaborative preference further enhances overall performance.</p></details> |  |

These LLMs come with different abilities and costs in terms of computation or pricing. Since the demand for each query can vary, e.g., because of the queried domain or its complexity, defaulting to one LLM in an application is not usually the best choice, whether it is the biggest, priciest, or even the one with the best average test performance. Consequently, picking the right LLM that is both accurate and cost-effective for an application is necessary yet remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce MetaLLM, a framework that dynamically and intelligently routes each query to the optimal LLM (among several available LLMs) for classification and multi-choice question-answering tasks, achieving significantly improved accuracy and cost-effectiveness. By framing the selection problem as a multi-armed bandit, MetaLLM balances prediction accuracy and cost efficiency under uncertainty. Our experiments, conducted on popular LLM platforms such as OpenAI and Together AI, as well as open-source LLM, showcase MetaLLM's efficacy in real-world scenarios, laying the groundwork for future extensions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Manipulating Multimodal Agents via Cross-Modal Prompt Injection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14348v2)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of multimodal large language models has redefined the agent paradigm by integrating language and vision modalities with external data sources, enabling agents to better interpret human instructions and execute increasingly complex tasks. However, in this work, we identify a critical yet previously overlooked security vulnerability in multimodal agents: cross-modal prompt injection attacks. To exploit this vulnerability, we propose CrossInject, a novel attack framework in which attackers embed adversarial perturbations across multiple modalities to align with target malicious content, allowing external instructions to hijack the agent's decision-making process and execute unauthorized tasks. Our approach consists of two key components. First, we introduce Visual Latent Alignment, where we optimize adversarial features to the malicious instructions in the visual embedding space based on a text-to-image generative model, ensuring that adversarial images subtly encode cues for malicious task execution. Subsequently, we present Textual Guidance Enhancement, where a large language model is leveraged to infer the black-box defensive system prompt through adversarial meta prompting and generate an malicious textual command that steers the agent's output toward better compliance with attackers' requests. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing injection attacks, achieving at least a +26.4% increase in attack success rates across diverse tasks. Furthermore, we validate our attack's effectiveness in real-world multimodal autonomous agents, highlighting its potential implications for safety-critical applications.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |

However, most existing benchmarks focus on isolated functions and fail to capture the complexity of real-world, class-level software structures. To address this gap, we introduce a large-scale, Python class-level dataset curated from $13{,}174$ real-world open-source projects. The dataset contains over 842,000 class skeletons, each including class and method signatures, along with associated docstrings when available. We preserve structural and contextual dependencies critical to realistic software development scenarios and enrich the dataset with static code metrics to support downstream analysis. To evaluate the usefulness of this dataset, we use extracted class skeletons as prompts for GPT-4 to generate full class implementations. Results show that the LLM-generated classes exhibit strong lexical and structural similarity to human-written counterparts, with average ROUGE@L, BLEU, and TSED scores of 0.80, 0.59, and 0.73, respectively. These findings confirm that well-structured prompts derived from real-world class skeletons significantly enhance LLM performance in class-level code generation. This dataset offers a valuable resource for benchmarking, training, and improving LLMs in realistic software engineering contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was submitted to the 29th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE 2025) AI models/data track</p></details> |

Three specialized agents collaborate in sequence: Agent1 uses an LLM to craft coherent, culturally grounded scripts;Agent2 employs visual generation models to render contextually accurate stage scenes; and Agent3 leverages TTS to produce synchronized, emotionally expressive vocal performances. In a case study on Dou E Yuan, the system achieved expert ratings of 3.8 for script fidelity, 3.5 for visual coherence, and 3.8 for speech accuracy-culminating in an overall score of 3.6, a 0.3 point improvement over a Single Agent baseline. Ablation experiments demonstrate that removing Agent2 or Agent3 leads to drops of 0.4 and 0.5 points, respectively, underscoring the value of modular collaboration. This work showcases how AI driven pipelines can streamline and scale the preservation of traditional performing arts, and points toward future enhancements in cross modal alignment, richer emotional nuance, and support for additional opera genres.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages,7 figures,1 tables</p></details> |

We investigated two automation paradigms by designing and implementing a fully automated copilot (AutoCopilot) and a semi-automated copilot (GuidedCopilot) that automates trivial steps while offering step-by-step visual guidance. In a user study (N=20) across data analysis and visual design tasks, GuidedCopilot outperformed AutoCopilot in user control, software utility, and learnability, especially for exploratory and creative tasks, while AutoCopilot saved time for simpler visual tasks. A follow-up design exploration (N=10) enhanced GuidedCopilot with task-and state-aware features, including in-context preview clips and adaptive instructions. Our findings highlight the critical role of user control and tailored guidance in designing the next generation of copilots that enhance productivity, support diverse skill levels, and foster deeper software engagement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2025), April 26 - May 1, 2025, Yokohama, Japan</p></details> |

However, their efficacy declines when tackling complex social media challenges such as propaganda detection, hateful meme classification, and toxicity identification. Much of the existing work has focused on using LLMs to generate synthetic training data, overlooking the potential of LLM-based text preprocessing and semantic augmentation. In this paper, we introduce an approach that prompts LLMs to clean noisy text and provide context-rich explanations, thereby enhancing training sets without substantial increases in data volume. We systematically evaluate on the SemEval 2024 multi-label Persuasive Meme dataset and further validate on the Google Jigsaw toxic comments and Facebook hateful memes datasets to assess generalizability. Our results reveal that zero-shot LLM classification underperforms on these high-context tasks compared to supervised models. In contrast, integrating LLM-based semantic augmentation yields performance on par with approaches that rely on human-annotated data, at a fraction of the cost. These findings underscore the importance of strategically incorporating LLMs into machine learning (ML) pipeline for social media classification tasks, offering broad implications for combating harmful content online.</p></details> |  |

However, directly utilizing these APIs as tools poses challenges due to their complex input schemas, elaborate responses, and often ambiguous documentation. Current benchmarks for tool testing do not adequately address these complexities, leading to a critical gap in evaluating API readiness for agent-driven automation. In this work, we present a novel testing framework aimed at evaluating and enhancing the readiness of REST APIs to function as tools for LLM-based agents. Our framework transforms apis as tools, generates comprehensive test cases for the APIs, translates tests cases into natural language instructions suitable for agents, enriches tool definitions and evaluates the agent's ability t correctly invoke the API and process its inputs and responses. To provide actionable insights, we analyze the outcomes of 750 test cases, presenting a detailed taxonomy of errors, including input misinterpretation, output handling inconsistencies, and schema mismatches. Additionally, we classify these test cases to streamline debugging and refinement of tool integrations. This work offers a foundational step toward enabling enterprise APIs as tools, improving their usability in agent-based applications.</p></details> |  |

Although LLMs can process multimodal information through projection functions that map visual features into their semantic space, recommendation tasks often require representing users' history interactions through lengthy prompts combining text and visual elements, which not only hampers training and inference efficiency but also makes it difficult for the model to accurately capture user preferences from complex and extended prompts, leading to reduced recommendation performance. To address this challenge, we introduce HistLLM, an innovative multimodal recommendation framework that integrates textual and visual features through a User History Encoding Module (UHEM), compressing multimodal user history interactions into a single token representation, effectively facilitating LLMs in processing user preferences. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed mechanism.</p></details> | <details><summary>We wa...</summary><p>We want to withdraw this paper and revise its experimental details.

Problem formulation is an important part of business optimisation as it influences both the validity of solutions and the efficiency of the optimisation process. While different optimisation modelling languages have been developed, problem formulation is still not a trivial task and usually requires optimisation expertise and problem-domain knowledge. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance across different language-related tasks. Since problem formulation can be viewed as a translation task, there is a potential to leverage LLMs to automate problem formulation. However, developing an LLM for problem formulation is challenging, due to limited training data, and the complexity of real-world optimisation problems. Several prompt engineering methods have been proposed in the literature to automate problem formulation with LLMs. While the initial results are encouraging, the accuracy of formulations generated by these methods can still be significantly improved. In this paper, we present an LLM-based framework for automating problem formulation in business optimization. Our approach introduces a method for fine-tuning cost-efficient LLMs specifically tailored to specialized business optimization challenges. The experiment results demonstrate that our framework can generate accurate formulations for conventional and real-world business optimisation problems in production scheduling. Extensive analyses show the effectiveness and the convergence of the proposed fine-tuning method. The proposed method also shows very competitive performance when compared with the state-of-the-art prompt engineering methods in the literature when tested on general linear programming problems.</p></details> |  |

To explore the capability of current LLMs to express emotions in their outputs, we conducted an experiment using several LLMs (OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, Meta Llama3, and Cohere Command R+) to role-play as agents answering questions with specified emotional states. We defined the emotional states using Russell's Circumplex model, a well-established framework that characterizes emotions along the sleepy-activated (arousal) and pleasure-displeasure (valence) axes. We chose this model for its simplicity, utilizing two continuous parameters, which allows for better controllability in applications involving continuous changes in emotional states. The responses generated were evaluated using a sentiment analysis model, independent of the LLMs, trained on the GoEmotions dataset. The evaluation showed that the emotional states of the generated answers were consistent with the specifications, demonstrating the LLMs' capability for emotional expression. This indicates the potential for LLM-based AI agents to simulate emotions, opening up a wide range of applications for emotion-based interactions, such as advisors or consultants who can provide advice or opinions with a personal touch.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 8 figures, accepted to the Natural Language Processing for Digital Humanities (NLP4DH) workshop at NAACL 2025</p></details> |

While Text-to-Speech (TTS) models have made huge progress, they still face challenges in controlling the emotional expression in the generated speech. In this work, we propose EmoVoice, a novel emotion-controllable TTS model that exploits large language models (LLMs) to enable fine-grained freestyle natural language emotion control, and a phoneme boost variant design that makes the model output phoneme tokens and audio tokens in parallel to enhance content consistency, inspired by chain-of-thought (CoT) and chain-of-modality (CoM) techniques. Besides, we introduce EmoVoice-DB, a high-quality 40-hour English emotion dataset featuring expressive speech and fine-grained emotion labels with natural language descriptions. EmoVoice achieves state-of-the-art performance on the English EmoVoice-DB test set using only synthetic training data, and on the Chinese Secap test set using our in-house data. We further investigate the reliability of existing emotion evaluation metrics and their alignment with human perceptual preferences, and explore using SOTA multimodal LLMs GPT-4o-audio and Gemini to assess emotional speech.

My work focuses on reinforcement learning (RL), multi-armed bandits, and their applications, including recommendation systems, computer networks, video analytics, and large language models (LLMs). Online learning methods, such as bandits and RL, have demonstrated remarkable success - ranging from outperforming human players in complex games like Atari and Go to advancing robotics, recommendation systems, and fine-tuning LLMs. Despite these successes, many established algorithms rely on idealized models that can fail under model misspecifications or adversarial perturbations, particularly in settings where accurate prior knowledge of the underlying model class is unavailable or where malicious users operate within dynamic systems. These challenges are pervasive in real-world applications, where robust and adaptive solutions are critical. Furthermore, while worst-case guarantees provide theoretical reliability, they often fail to capture instance-dependent performance, which can lead to more efficient and practical solutions. Another key challenge lies in generalizing to new, unseen environments, a crucial requirement for deploying these methods in dynamic and unpredictable settings. To address these limitations, my research aims to develop more efficient, robust, instance-adaptive, and generalizable online learning algorithms for both reinforcement learning and bandits. Towards this end, I focus on developing more efficient, robust, instance-adaptive, and generalizable for both general reinforcement learning (RL) and bandits.</p></details> | Ph.D. Thesis |

As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, they show great potential for processing IP tasks, enabling more efficient analysis, understanding, and generation of IP-related content. However, existing datasets and benchmarks either focus narrowly on patents or cover limited aspects of the IP field, lacking alignment with real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive IP task taxonomy and a large, diverse bilingual benchmark, IPBench, covering 8 IP mechanisms and 20 tasks. This benchmark is designed to evaluate LLMs in real-world intellectual property applications, encompassing both understanding and generation. We benchmark 16 LLMs, ranging from general-purpose to domain-specific models, and find that even the best-performing model achieves only 75.8% accuracy, revealing substantial room for improvement. Notably, open-source IP and law-oriented models lag behind closed-source general-purpose models. We publicly release all data and code of IPBench and will continue to update it with additional IP-related tasks to better reflect real-world challenges in the intellectual property domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>89 pa...</summary><p>89 pages, 75 figures, 55 tables</p></details> |

This position paper examines over 2,000 multilingual (non-English) benchmarks from 148 countries, published between 2021 and 2024, to evaluate past, present, and future practices in multilingual benchmarking. Our findings reveal that, despite significant investments amounting to tens of millions of dollars, English remains significantly overrepresented in these benchmarks. Additionally, most benchmarks rely on original language content rather than translations, with the majority sourced from high-resource countries such as China, India, Germany, the UK, and the USA. Furthermore, a comparison of benchmark performance with human judgments highlights notable disparities. STEM-related tasks exhibit strong correlations with human evaluations (0.70 to 0.85), while traditional NLP tasks like question answering (e.g., XQuAD) show much weaker correlations (0.11 to 0.30). Moreover, translating English benchmarks into other languages proves insufficient, as localized benchmarks demonstrate significantly higher alignment with local human judgments (0.68) than their translated counterparts (0.47). This underscores the importance of creating culturally and linguistically tailored benchmarks rather than relying solely on translations. Through this comprehensive analysis, we highlight six key limitations in current multilingual evaluation practices, propose the guiding principles accordingly for effective multilingual benchmarking, and outline five critical research directions to drive progress in the field. Finally, we call for a global collaborative effort to develop human-aligned benchmarks that prioritize real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>work ...</summary><p>work in progress; 22 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables;</p></details> |

While large language models (LLMs) have been extended to handle the speech modality, streaming remains challenging as speech is prepended as a prompt for the entire generation process. To unlock LLM streaming capability, this paper proposes SimulS2S-LLM, which trains speech LLMs offline and employs a test-time policy to guide simultaneous inference. SimulS2S-LLM alleviates the mismatch between training and inference by extracting boundary-aware speech prompts that allows it to be better matched with text input data. SimulS2S-LLM achieves simultaneous speech-to-speech translation (Simul-S2ST) by predicting discrete output speech tokens and then synthesising output speech using a pre-trained vocoder. An incremental beam search is designed to expand the search space of speech token prediction without increasing latency. Experiments on the CVSS speech data show that SimulS2S-LLM offers a better translation quality-latency trade-off than existing methods that use the same training data, such as improving ASR-BLEU scores by 3 points at similar latency.</p></details> |  |

Yet, traditional A/B testing remains constrained by its dependence on the large-scale and live traffic of human participants, and the long time of waiting for the testing result. Through formative interviews with six experienced industry practitioners, we identified critical bottlenecks in current A/B testing workflows. In response, we present AgentA/B, a novel system that leverages Large Language Model-based autonomous agents (LLM Agents) to automatically simulate user interaction behaviors with real webpages. AgentA/B enables scalable deployment of LLM agents with diverse personas, each capable of navigating the dynamic webpage and interactively executing multi-step interactions like search, clicking, filtering, and purchasing. In a demonstrative controlled experiment, we employ AgentA/B to simulate a between-subject A/B testing with 1,000 LLM agents Amazon.com, and compare agent behaviors with real human shopping behaviors at a scale. Our findings suggest AgentA/B can emulate human-like behavior patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Certifying Counterfactual Bias in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18780v3)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) can produce biased responses that can cause representational harms. However, conventional studies are insufficient to thoroughly evaluate biases across LLM responses for different demographic groups (a.k.a. counterfactual bias), as they do not scale to large number of inputs and do not provide guarantees. Therefore, we propose the first framework, LLMCert-B that certifies LLMs for counterfactual bias on distributions of prompts. A certificate consists of high-confidence bounds on the probability of unbiased LLM responses for any set of counterfactual prompts - prompts differing by demographic groups, sampled from a distribution. We illustrate counterfactual bias certification for distributions of counterfactual prompts created by applying prefixes sampled from prefix distributions, to a given set of prompts. We consider prefix distributions consisting random token sequences, mixtures of manual jailbreaks, and perturbations of jailbreaks in LLM's embedding space. We generate non-trivial certificates for SOTA LLMs, exposing their vulnerabilities over distributions of prompts generated from computationally inexpensive prefix distributions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Certifying Knowledge Comprehension in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15929v3)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in safety-critical systems where they provide answers based on in-context information derived from knowledge bases. As LLMs are increasingly envisioned as superhuman agents, their proficiency in knowledge comprehension-extracting relevant information and reasoning over it to answer questions, a key facet of human intelligence-becomes crucial. However, existing evaluations of LLMs on knowledge comprehension are typically conducted on small test sets, but these datasets represent only a tiny fraction of the vast number of possible queries. Simple empirical evaluations on these limited test sets raises concerns about the reliability and generalizability of the results. In this work, we introduce the first specification and certification framework for knowledge comprehension in LLMs, providing formal probabilistic guarantees for reliability. Instead of a fixed dataset, we design novel specifications that mathematically represent prohibitively large probability distributions of knowledge comprehension prompts with natural noise, using knowledge graphs. From these specifications, we generate quantitative certificates that offer high-confidence, tight bounds on the probability that a given LLM correctly answers any question drawn from the specification distribution. We apply our framework to certify SOTA LLMs in two domains: precision medicine and general question-answering. Our results reveal previously unrecognized vulnerabilities in SOTA LLMs due to natural noise in the prompts. Additionally, we establish performance hierarchies with formal guarantees among the SOTA LLMs, particularly in the context of precision medicine question-answering.</p></details> |  |
| **[In-context Ranking Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15477v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) allow large language models (LLMs) to function as implicit ranking models by maximizing the margin between preferred and non-preferred responses. In practice, user feedback on such lists typically involves identifying a few relevant items in context rather than providing detailed pairwise comparisons for every possible item pair. Moreover, many complex information retrieval tasks, such as conversational agents and summarization systems, critically depend on ranking the highest-quality outputs at the top, emphasizing the need to support natural and flexible forms of user feedback. To address the challenge of limited and sparse pairwise feedback in the in-context setting, we propose an In-context Ranking Preference Optimization (IRPO) framework that directly optimizes LLMs based on ranking lists constructed during inference. To further capture flexible forms of feedback, IRPO extends the DPO objective by incorporating both the relevance of items and their positions in the list. Modeling these aspects jointly is non-trivial, as ranking metrics are inherently discrete and non-differentiable, making direct optimization difficult. To overcome this, IRPO introduces a differentiable objective based on positional aggregation of pairwise item preferences, enabling effective gradient-based optimization of discrete ranking metrics. We further provide theoretical insights showing that IRPO (i) automatically emphasizes items with greater disagreement between the model and the reference ranking, and (ii) links its gradient to an importance sampling estimator, yielding an unbiased estimator with reduced variance. Empirical results show IRPO outperforms standard DPO approaches in ranking performance, highlighting its effectiveness in aligning LLMs with direct in-context ranking preferences.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[From Reviews to Dialogues: Active Synthesis for Zero-Shot LLM-based Conversational Recommender System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15476v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conversational recommender systems (CRS) typically require extensive domain-specific conversational datasets, yet high costs, privacy concerns, and data-collection challenges severely limit their availability. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong zero-shot recommendation capabilities, practical applications often favor smaller, internally managed recommender models due to scalability, interpretability, and data privacy constraints, especially in sensitive or rapidly evolving domains. However, training these smaller models effectively still demands substantial domain-specific conversational data, which remains challenging to obtain. To address these limitations, we propose an active data augmentation framework that synthesizes conversational training data by leveraging black-box LLMs guided by active learning techniques. Specifically, our method utilizes publicly available non-conversational domain data, including item metadata, user reviews, and collaborative signals, as seed inputs. By employing active learning strategies to select the most informative seed samples, our approach efficiently guides LLMs to generate synthetic, semantically coherent conversational interactions tailored explicitly to the target domain. Extensive experiments validate that conversational data generated by our proposed framework significantly improves the performance of LLM-based CRS models, effectively addressing the challenges of building CRS in no- or low-resource scenarios.</p></details> | 11 pages, 2 figures |

In this paper, we establish a surprising connection between speculative decoding and channel simulation, which aims at simulating a noisy channel using as few bits as possible. This connection allows us to provide an information-theoretic analysis of the speed up that can be achieved by speculative decoding. Leveraging this link, we derive an explicit relation between generation speed-up and the number of tokens $k$ generated by the draft model for large $k$, which serves as an upper bound for all $k$. We also propose a novel speculative decoding method via exponential race ERSD that matches state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

Codenames presents a highly interesting challenge for achieving successful AI performance, requiring both a sophisticated understanding of language, theory of mind, and epistemic reasoning capabilities. Prior attempts to develop agents for Codenames have largely relied on word embedding techniques, which have a limited vocabulary range and perform poorly when paired with differing approaches. LLMs have demonstrated enhanced reasoning and comprehension capabilities for language-based tasks, but can still suffer in lateral thinking challenges. We evaluate the capabilities of several state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Llama 3.1, across a variety of board setups. Our results indicate that while certain LLMs perform better than others overall, different models exhibit varying emergent behaviours during gameplay and excel at specific roles. We also evaluate the performance of different combinations of LLMs when playing cooperatively together, demonstrating that LLM agents are more generalisable to a wider range of teammates than prior techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Feature testing is crucial in achieving this goal. However, the multi-user interactive features within the app, such as live streaming, voice calls, etc., pose significant challenges for developers, who must handle simultaneous device management and user interaction coordination. To address this, we introduce a novel multi-agent approach, powered by the Large Language Models (LLMs), to automate the testing of multi-user interactive app features. In detail, we build a virtual device farm that allocates the necessary number of devices for a given multi-user interactive task. For each device, we deploy an LLM-based agent that simulates a user, thereby mimicking user interactions to collaboratively automate the testing process. The evaluations on 24 multi-user interactive tasks within the TikTok app, showcase its capability to cover 75% of tasks with 85.9% action similarity and offer 87% time savings for developers. Additionally, we have also integrated our approach into the real-world TikTok testing platform, aiding in the detection of 26 multi-user interactive bugs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICSE 2025 Industry paper</p></details> |
| **[Emergence and Evolution of Interpretable Concepts in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15473v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have become the go-to method for text-to-image generation, producing high-quality images from noise through a process called reverse diffusion. Understanding the dynamics of the reverse diffusion process is crucial in steering the generation and achieving high sample quality. However, the inner workings of diffusion models is still largely a mystery due to their black-box nature and complex, multi-step generation process. Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) techniques, such as Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), aim at uncovering the operating principles of models through granular analysis of their internal representations. These MI techniques have been successful in understanding and steering the behavior of large language models at scale. However, the great potential of SAEs has not yet been applied toward gaining insight into the intricate generative process of diffusion models. In this work, we leverage the SAE framework to probe the inner workings of a popular text-to-image diffusion model, and uncover a variety of human-interpretable concepts in its activations. Interestingly, we find that even before the first reverse diffusion step is completed, the final composition of the scene can be predicted surprisingly well by looking at the spatial distribution of activated concepts. Moreover, going beyond correlational analysis, we show that the discovered concepts have a causal effect on the model output and can be leveraged to steer the generative process. We design intervention techniques aimed at manipulating image composition and style, and demonstrate that (1) in early stages of diffusion image composition can be effectively controlled, (2) in the middle stages of diffusion image composition is finalized, however stylistic interventions are effective, and (3) in the final stages of diffusion only minor textural details are subject to change.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 32 figures, preliminary version</p></details> |

By synergizing retrieval mechanisms with advanced reasoning, LLMs can now tackle increasingly complex problems. This paper presents a systematic review of the collaborative interplay between RAG and reasoning, clearly defining "reasoning" within the RAG context. It construct a comprehensive taxonomy encompassing multi-dimensional collaborative objectives, representative paradigms, and technical implementations, and analyze the bidirectional synergy methods. Additionally, we critically evaluate current limitations in RAG assessment, including the absence of intermediate supervision for multi-step reasoning and practical challenges related to cost-risk trade-offs. To bridge theory and practice, we provide practical guidelines tailored to diverse real-world applications. Finally, we identify promising research directions, such as graph-based knowledge integration, hybrid model collaboration, and RL-driven optimization. Overall, this work presents a theoretical framework and practical foundation to advance RAG systems in academia and industry, fostering the next generation of RAG solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Viability of Crowdsourcing for RAG Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15689v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How good are humans at writing and judging responses in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) scenarios? To answer this question, we investigate the efficacy of crowdsourcing for RAG through two complementary studies: response writing and response utility judgment. We present the Crowd RAG Corpus 2025 (CrowdRAG-25), which consists of 903 human-written and 903 LLM-generated responses for the 301 topics of the TREC RAG'24 track, across the three discourse styles 'bulleted list', 'essay', and 'news'. For a selection of 65 topics, the corpus further contains 47,320 pairwise human judgments and 10,556 pairwise LLM judgments across seven utility dimensions (e.g., coverage and coherence). Our analyses give insights into human writing behavior for RAG and the viability of crowdsourcing for RAG evaluation. Human pairwise judgments provide reliable and cost-effective results compared to LLM-based pairwise or human/LLM-based pointwise judgments, as well as automated comparisons with human-written reference responses. All our data and tools are freely available.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 tables, 5 figures. Accepted at SIGIR'25</p></details> |
| **[CiteFix: Enhancing RAG Accuracy Through Post-Processing Citation Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15629v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful application of Large Language Models (LLMs), revolutionizing information search and consumption. RAG systems combine traditional search capabilities with LLMs to generate comprehensive answers to user queries, ideally with accurate citations. However, in our experience of developing a RAG product, LLMs often struggle with source attribution, aligning with other industry studies reporting citation accuracy rates of only about 74% for popular generative search engines. To address this, we present efficient post-processing algorithms to improve citation accuracy in LLM-generated responses, with minimal impact on latency and cost. Our approaches cross-check generated citations against retrieved articles using methods including keyword + semantic matching, fine tuned model with BERTScore, and a lightweight LLM-based technique. Our experimental results demonstrate a relative improvement of 15.46% in the overall accuracy metrics of our RAG system. This significant enhancement potentially enables a shift from our current larger language model to a relatively smaller model that is approximately 12x more cost-effective and 3x faster in inference time, while maintaining comparable performance. This research contributes to enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of AI-generated content in information retrieval and summarization tasks which is critical to gain customer trust especially in commercial products.</p></details> |  |

A crucial factor in RAG evaluation is "support", whether the information in the cited documents supports the answer. To this end, we conducted a large-scale comparative study of 45 participant submissions on 36 topics to the TREC 2024 RAG Track, comparing an automatic LLM judge (GPT-4o) against human judges for support assessment. We considered two conditions: (1) fully manual assessments from scratch and (2) manual assessments with post-editing of LLM predictions. Our results indicate that for 56% of the manual from-scratch assessments, human and GPT-4o predictions match perfectly (on a three-level scale), increasing to 72% in the manual with post-editing condition. Furthermore, by carefully analyzing the disagreements in an unbiased study, we found that an independent human judge correlates better with GPT-4o than a human judge, suggesting that LLM judges can be a reliable alternative for support assessment. To conclude, we provide a qualitative analysis of human and GPT-4o errors to help guide future iterations of support assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGIR 2025 (short)</p></details> |
| **[The Great Nugget Recall: Automating Fact Extraction and RAG Evaluation with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15068v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced the capabilities of information access systems, especially with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Nevertheless, the evaluation of RAG systems remains a barrier to continued progress, a challenge we tackle in this work by proposing an automatic evaluation framework that is validated against human annotations. We believe that the nugget evaluation methodology provides a solid foundation for evaluating RAG systems. This approach, originally developed for the TREC Question Answering (QA) Track in 2003, evaluates systems based on atomic facts that should be present in good answers. Our efforts focus on "refactoring" this methodology, where we describe the AutoNuggetizer framework that specifically applies LLMs to both automatically create nuggets and automatically assign nuggets to system answers. In the context of the TREC 2024 RAG Track, we calibrate a fully automatic approach against strategies where nuggets are created manually or semi-manually by human assessors and then assigned manually to system answers. Based on results from a community-wide evaluation, we observe strong agreement at the run level between scores derived from fully automatic nugget evaluation and human-based variants. The agreement is stronger when individual framework components such as nugget assignment are automated independently. This suggests that our evaluation framework provides tradeoffs between effort and quality that can be used to guide the development of future RAG systems. However, further research is necessary to refine our approach, particularly in establishing robust per-topic agreement to diagnose system failures effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in SIGIR 2025.

| **[AlignRAG: An Adaptable Framework for Resolving Misalignments in Retrieval-Aware Reasoning of RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14858v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a foundational paradigm for knowledge-grounded text generation. However, existing RAG pipelines often fail to ensure that the reasoning trajectories align with the evidential constraints imposed by retrieved content. In this paper, we reframe RAG as a problem of retrieval-aware reasoning and identify a core challenge: reasoning misalignment-the mismatch between a model's reasoning trajectory and the retrieved evidence. To address this challenge, we propose AlignRAG, a novel test-time framework that mitigates reasoning misalignment through iterative Critique-Driven Alignment (CDA) steps. In contrast to prior approaches that rely on static training or post-hoc selection, AlignRAG actively refines reasoning trajectories during inference by enforcing fine-grained alignment with evidence. Our framework introduces a new paradigm for retrieval-aware reasoning by: (1) constructing context-rich training corpora; (2) generating contrastive critiques from preference-aware reasoning trajectories; (3) training a dedicated \textit{Critic Language Model (CLM)} to identify reasoning misalignments; and (4) applying CDA steps to optimize reasoning trajectories iteratively. Empirical results demonstrate that AlignRAG consistently outperforms all baselines and could integrate as a plug-and-play module into existing RAG pipelines without further changes. By reconceptualizing RAG as a structured reasoning trajectory and establishing the test-time framework for correcting reasoning misalignments in RAG, AlignRAG provides practical advancements for retrieval-aware generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[FinSage: A Multi-aspect RAG System for Financial Filings Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14493v1)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging large language models in real-world settings often entails a need to utilize domain-specific data and tools in order to follow the complex regulations that need to be followed for acceptable use. Within financial sectors, modern enterprises increasingly rely on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to address complex compliance requirements in financial document workflows. However, existing solutions struggle to account for the inherent heterogeneity of data (e.g., text, tables, diagrams) and evolving nature of regulatory standards used in financial filings, leading to compromised accuracy in critical information extraction. We propose the FinSage framework as a solution, utilizing a multi-aspect RAG framework tailored for regulatory compliance analysis in multi-modal financial documents. FinSage introduces three innovative components: (1) a multi-modal pre-processing pipeline that unifies diverse data formats and generates chunk-level metadata summaries, (2) a multi-path sparse-dense retrieval system augmented with query expansion (HyDE) and metadata-aware semantic search, and (3) a domain-specialized re-ranking module fine-tuned via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to prioritize compliance-critical content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FinSage achieves an impressive recall of 92.51% on 75 expert-curated questions derived from surpasses the best baseline method on the FinanceBench question answering datasets by 24.06% in accuracy. Moreover, FinSage has been successfully deployed as financial question-answering agent in online meetings, where it has already served more than 1,200 people.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional vulnerabilities, these packages are intentionally designed to deceive users, making detection challenging due to evolving attack methods and the lack of structured datasets. In this work, we empirically evaluate the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and few-shot learning for detecting malicious source code. We fine-tune LLMs on curated datasets and integrate YARA rules, GitHub Security Advisories, and malicious code snippets with the aim of enhancing classification accuracy. We came across a counterintuitive outcome: While RAG is expected to boost up the prediction performance, it fails in the performed evaluation, obtaining a mediocre accuracy. In contrast, few-shot learning is more effective as it significantly improves the detection of malicious code, achieving 97% accuracy and 95% balanced accuracy, outperforming traditional RAG approaches. Thus, future work should expand structured knowledge bases, refine retrieval models, and explore hybrid AI-driven cybersecurity solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been peer-reviewed and accepted for publication to the 29th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE 2025)</p></details> |
| **[RAG Without the Lag: Interactive Debugging for Retrieval-Augmented Generation Pipelines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13587v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines have become the de-facto approach for building AI assistants with access to external, domain-specific knowledge. Given a user query, RAG pipelines typically first retrieve (R) relevant information from external sources, before invoking a Large Language Model (LLM), augmented (A) with this information, to generate (G) responses. Modern RAG pipelines frequently chain multiple retrieval and generation components, in any order. However, developing effective RAG pipelines is challenging because retrieval and generation components are intertwined, making it hard to identify which component(s) cause errors in the eventual output. The parameters with the greatest impact on output quality often require hours of pre-processing after each change, creating prohibitively slow feedback cycles. To address these challenges, we present RAGGY, a developer tool that combines a Python library of composable RAG primitives with an interactive interface for real-time debugging. We contribute the design and implementation of RAGGY, insights into expert debugging patterns through a qualitative study with 12 engineers, and design implications for future RAG tools that better align with developers' natural workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

When relevant internal documents are unavailable, the system struggles to generate accurate and complete responses. Additionally, using closed-source Large Language Models (LLMs) raises concerns about exposing proprietary information. To address these issues, we propose the Secure Multifaceted-RAG (SecMulti-RAG) framework, which retrieves not only from internal documents but also from two supplementary sources: pre-generated expert knowledge for anticipated queries and on-demand external LLM-generated knowledge. To mitigate security risks, we adopt a local open-source generator and selectively utilize external LLMs only when prompts are deemed safe by a filtering mechanism. This approach enhances completeness, prevents data leakage, and reduces costs. In our evaluation on a report generation task in the automotive industry, SecMulti-RAG significantly outperforms traditional RAG - achieving 79.3 to 91.9 percent win rates across correctness, richness, and helpfulness in LLM-based evaluation, and 56.3 to 70.4 percent in human evaluation. This highlights SecMulti-RAG as a practical and secure solution for enterprise RAG.</p></details> |  |

However, deploying RAG on consumer-grade platforms is challenging due to limited memory and the increasing scale of both models and knowledge bases. In this work, we introduce RAGDoll, a resource-efficient, self-adaptive RAG serving system integrated with LLMs, specifically designed for resource-constrained platforms. RAGDoll exploits the insight that RAG retrieval and LLM generation impose different computational and memory demands, which in a traditional serial workflow result in substantial idle times and poor resource utilization. Based on this insight, RAGDoll decouples retrieval and generation into parallel pipelines, incorporating joint memory placement and dynamic batch scheduling strategies to optimize resource usage across diverse hardware devices and workloads. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAGDoll adapts effectively to various hardware configurations and LLM scales, achieving up to 3.6 times speedup in average latency compared to serial RAG systems based on vLLM.</p></details> |  |

This advancement has enabled their widespread deployment across sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and enterprise applications. RAG mitigates hallucinations by integrating external knowledge, yet introduces privacy risk and security risk, notably data breaching risk and data poisoning risk. While recent studies have explored prompt injection and poisoning attacks, there remains a significant gap in comprehensive research on controlling inbound and outbound query flows to mitigate these threats. In this paper, we propose an AI firewall, ControlNET, designed to safeguard RAG-based LLM systems from these vulnerabilities. ControlNET controls query flows by leveraging activation shift phenomena to detect adversarial queries and mitigate their impact through semantic divergence. We conduct comprehensive experiments on four different benchmark datasets including Msmarco, HotpotQA, FinQA, and MedicalSys using state-of-the-art open source LLMs (Llama3, Vicuna, and Mistral). Our results demonstrate that ControlNET achieves over 0.909 AUROC in detecting and mitigating security threats while preserving system harmlessness. Overall, ControlNET offers an effective, robust, harmless defense mechanism, marking a significant advancement toward the secure deployment of RAG-based LLM systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://ai.zjuicsr.cn/firewall</p></details> |

As a result, recent efforts focus on instruction-tuning open-source LLMs, though the potential of combining them with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we are the first to explore a knowledge graph-based (KG) RAG framework for Japanese medical QA small-scale open-source LLMs. Experimental results show that KG-based RAG has only a limited impact on Japanese medical QA using small-scale open-source LLMs. Further case studies reveal that the effectiveness of the RAG is sensitive to the quality and relevance of the external retrieved content. These findings offer valuable insights into the challenges and potential of applying RAG in Japanese medical QA, while also serving as a reference for other low-resource languages.</p></details> | 10 pages |

However, they also exhibit inherent limitations, such as outdated knowledge and susceptibility to hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm to address these issues, but it also introduces new vulnerabilities. Recent efforts have focused on the security of RAG-based LLMs, yet existing attack methods face three critical challenges: (1) their effectiveness declines sharply when only a limited number of poisoned texts can be injected into the knowledge database, (2) they lack sufficient stealth, as the attacks are often detectable by anomaly detection systems, which compromises their effectiveness, and (3) they rely on heuristic approaches to generate poisoned texts, lacking formal optimization frameworks and theoretic guarantees, which limits their effectiveness and applicability. To address these issues, we propose coordinated Prompt-RAG attack (PR-attack), a novel optimization-driven attack that introduces a small number of poisoned texts into the knowledge database while embedding a backdoor trigger within the prompt. When activated, the trigger causes the LLM to generate pre-designed responses to targeted queries, while maintaining normal behavior in other contexts. This ensures both high effectiveness and stealth. We formulate the attack generation process as a bilevel optimization problem leveraging a principled optimization framework to develop optimal poisoned texts and triggers. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PR-Attack, achieving a high attack success rate even with a limited number of poisoned texts and significantly improved stealth compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

CRs can be exploited for analyzing vulnerabilities and experimenting with the effectiveness of devised countermeasures, as well as serving as training environments for building cyber security skills and abilities for IT operators. This paper proposes ARCeR as an innovative solution for the automatic generation and deployment of CRs, starting from user-provided descriptions in a natural language. ARCeR relies on the Agentic RAG paradigm, which allows it to fully exploit state-of-art AI technologies. Experimental results show that ARCeR is able to successfully process prompts even in cases that LLMs or basic RAG systems are not able to cope with. Furthermore, ARCeR is able to target any CR framework provided that specific knowledge is made available to it.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Visual RAG Pipeline for Few-Shot Fine-Grained Product Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11838v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the rapid evolution of learning and computer vision algorithms, Fine-Grained Classification (FGC) still poses an open problem in many practically relevant applications. In the retail domain, for example, the identification of fast changing and visually highly similar products and their properties are key to automated price-monitoring and product recommendation. This paper presents a novel Visual RAG pipeline that combines the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach and Vision Language Models (VLMs) for few-shot FGC. This Visual RAG pipeline extracts product and promotion data in advertisement leaflets from various retailers and simultaneously predicts fine-grained product ids along with price and discount information. Compared to previous approaches, the key characteristic of the Visual RAG pipeline is that it allows the prediction of novel products without re-training, simply by adding a few class samples to the RAG database. Comparing several VLM back-ends like GPT-4o [23], GPT-4o-mini [24], and Gemini 2.0 Flash [10], our approach achieves 86.8% accuracy on a diverse dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Shared Disk KV Cache Management for Efficient Multi-Instance Inference in RAG-Powered LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11765v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent large language models (LLMs) face increasing inference latency as input context length and model size continue to grow. In particular, the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique, which enhances LLM responses by incorporating external knowledge, exacerbates this issue by significantly increasing the number of input tokens. This expansion in token length leads to a substantial rise in computational overhead, particularly during the prefill stage, resulting in prolonged time-to-first-token (TTFT). To address this issue, this paper proposes a method to reduce TTFT by leveraging a disk-based key-value (KV) cache to lessen the computational burden during the prefill stage. We also introduce a disk-based shared KV cache management system, called Shared RAG-DCache, for multi-instance LLM RAG service environments. This system, together with an optimal system configuration, improves both throughput and latency under given resource constraints. Shared RAG-DCache exploits the locality of documents related to user queries in RAG, as well as the queueing delay in LLM inference services. It proactively generates and stores disk KV caches for query-related documents and shares them across multiple LLM instances to enhance inference performance. In experiments on a single host equipped with 2 GPUs and 1 CPU, Shared RAG-DCache achieved a 15~71% increase in throughput and up to a 12~65% reduction in latency, depending on the resource configuration.</p></details> |  |

By exploiting the inherent structure of the corpus, graph-based RAG methods further enrich this process by building a knowledge graph index and leveraging the structural nature of graphs. However, current graph-based RAG approaches seldom prioritize the design of graph structures. Inadequately designed graph not only impede the seamless integration of diverse graph algorithms but also result in workflow inconsistencies and degraded performance. To further unleash the potential of graph for RAG, we propose NodeRAG, a graph-centric framework introducing heterogeneous graph structures that enable the seamless and holistic integration of graph-based methodologies into the RAG workflow. By aligning closely with the capabilities of LLMs, this framework ensures a fully cohesive and efficient end-to-end process. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that NodeRAG exhibits performance advantages over previous methods, including GraphRAG and LightRAG, not only in indexing time, query time, and storage efficiency but also in delivering superior question-answering performance on multi-hop benchmarks and open-ended head-to-head evaluations with minimal retrieval tokens.

| **[Towards Automated Safety Requirements Derivation Using Agent-based RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11243v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the automated derivation of safety requirements in a self-driving vehicle use case, leveraging LLMs in combination with agent-based retrieval-augmented generation. Conventional approaches that utilise pre-trained LLMs to assist in safety analyses typically lack domain-specific knowledge. Existing RAG approaches address this issue, yet their performance deteriorates when handling complex queries and it becomes increasingly harder to retrieve the most relevant information. This is particularly relevant for safety-relevant applications. In this paper, we propose the use of agent-based RAG to derive safety requirements and show that the retrieved information is more relevant to the queries. We implement an agent-based approach on a document pool of automotive standards and the Apollo case study, as a representative example of an automated driving perception system. Our solution is tested on a data set of safety requirement questions and answers, extracted from the Apollo data. Evaluating a set of selected RAG metrics, we present and discuss advantages of a agent-based approach compared to default RAG methods.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |
| **[SlowFastVAD: Video Anomaly Detection via Integrating Simple Detector and RAG-Enhanced Vision-Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10320v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) aims to identify unexpected events in videos and has wide applications in safety-critical domains. While semi-supervised methods trained on only normal samples have gained traction, they often suffer from high false alarm rates and poor interpretability. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong multimodal reasoning capabilities, offering new opportunities for explainable anomaly detection. However, their high computational cost and lack of domain adaptation hinder real-time deployment and reliability. Inspired by dual complementary pathways in human visual perception, we propose SlowFastVAD, a hybrid framework that integrates a fast anomaly detector with a slow anomaly detector (namely a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) enhanced VLM), to address these limitations. Specifically, the fast detector first provides coarse anomaly confidence scores, and only a small subset of ambiguous segments, rather than the entire video, is further analyzed by the slower yet more interpretable VLM for elaborate detection and reasoning. Furthermore, to adapt VLMs to domain-specific VAD scenarios, we construct a knowledge base including normal patterns based on few normal samples and abnormal patterns inferred by VLMs. During inference, relevant patterns are retrieved and used to augment prompts for anomaly reasoning. Finally, we smoothly fuse the anomaly confidence of fast and slow detectors to enhance robustness of anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that SlowFastVAD effectively combines the strengths of both fast and slow detectors, and achieves remarkable detection accuracy and interpretability with significantly reduced computational overhead, making it well-suited for real-world VAD applications with high reliability requirements.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Personalization: From RAG to Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10147v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalization has become an essential capability in modern AI systems, enabling customized interactions that align with individual user preferences, contexts, and goals. Recent research has increasingly concentrated on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks and their evolution into more advanced agent-based architectures within personalized settings to enhance user satisfaction. Building on this foundation, this survey systematically examines personalization across the three core stages of RAG: pre-retrieval, retrieval, and generation. Beyond RAG, we further extend its capabilities into the realm of Personalized LLM-based Agents, which enhance traditional RAG systems with agentic functionalities, including user understanding, personalized planning and execution, and dynamic generation. For both personalization in RAG and agent-based personalization, we provide formal definitions, conduct a comprehensive review of recent literature, and summarize key datasets and evaluation metrics. Additionally, we discuss fundamental challenges, limitations, and promising research directions in this evolving field. Relevant papers and resources are continuously updated at https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/Awesome-Personalized-RAG-Agent.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |
| **[RAG-Based Fuzzing of Cross-Architecture Compilers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08967v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>OneAPI is an open standard that supports cross-architecture software development with minimal effort from developers. It brings DPC++ and C++ compilers which need to be thoroughly tested to verify their correctness, reliability, and security. Compilers have numerous code flows and optimization features. This process requires developers with deep understanding of the different compiler flows to craft testcases specific to target paths in the compiler. This testcase creation is a time-consuming and costly process. In this paper, we propose a large-language model (LLM)-based compiler fuzzing tool that integrates the concept of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). This tool automates the testcase generation task and relieves experienced compiler developers from investing time to craft testcase generation patterns. We test our proposed approach on the Intel DPC++/C++ compiler. This compiler compiles SYCL code and allows developers to offload it to different architectures, e.g. GPUs and CPUs from different vendors. Using this tool, we managed to identify 87 SYCL code test cases that lead to output value mismatch or compiler runtime errors when compiled using Intel DPC++ and clang++ compilers and run on different architectures. The testcases and the identified unexpected behaviors of the compilers under test were obtained within only few hours with no prior background on the compiler passes under tests. This tool facilitates efficient compiler fuzzing with reduced developer time requirements via the dynamic testcase creation capability provided by an LLM with RAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Adaptive Vector Index Partitioning Scheme for Low-Latency RAG Pipeline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08930v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance response quality by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with vector databases, enabling external knowledge retrieval to support language model reasoning. While RAG enables efficient question answering with smaller LLMs, existing optimizations for vector search and LLM serving have largely been developed in isolation. As a result, their integration often leads to suboptimal end-to-end performance. ... This paper introduces VectorLiteRAG, an optimized vector index partitioning mechanism designed for RAG systems that enhances the responsiveness of the system by jointly optimizing vector search and LLM serving across CPU and GPU system. A key challenge is to determine which indices and how much of the vector index should reside on the GPU and adjusting LLM batch sizes to balance the pipeline for lower Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and meeting user-defined Service-Level Objectives (SLOs). To address this, we leverage the insight that cluster access in vector databases exhibits access skew, where a subset of clusters are queried significantly more frequently than others. VectorLiteRAG exploits this property through an optimized memory distribution strategy, dynamically allocating the minimum number of vector indices corresponding to frequently accessed clusters onto the GPU HBM to ensure a balanced pipeline with the LLM for high responsiveness. This adaptive partitioning scheme is guided by a statistical model that informs memory allocation and workload distribution. Our evaluation demonstrates that VectorLiteRAG improves vector search responsiveness by 2x, significantly reduces end-to-end TTFT in RAG systems by intelligently balancing memory resources between vector search and LLM execution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Out of Style: RAG's Fragility to Linguistic Variation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08231v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the impressive performance of Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) systems across various NLP benchmarks, their robustness in handling real-world user-LLM interaction queries remains largely underexplored. This presents a critical gap for practical deployment, where user queries exhibit greater linguistic variations and can trigger cascading errors across interdependent RAG components. In this work, we systematically analyze how varying four linguistic dimensions (formality, readability, politeness, and grammatical correctness) impact RAG performance. We evaluate two retrieval models and nine LLMs, ranging from 3 to 72 billion parameters, across four information-seeking Question Answering (QA) datasets. Our results reveal that linguistic reformulations significantly impact both retrieval and generation stages, leading to a relative performance drop of up to 40.41% in Recall@5 scores for less formal queries and 38.86% in answer match scores for queries containing grammatical errors. Notably, RAG systems exhibit greater sensitivity to such variations compared to LLM-only generations, highlighting their vulnerability to error propagation due to linguistic shifts. These findings highlight the need for improved robustness techniques to enhance reliability in diverse user interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A System for Comprehensive Assessment of RAG Frameworks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07803v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a standard paradigm for enhancing the factual accuracy and contextual relevance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating retrieval mechanisms. However, existing evaluation frameworks fail to provide a holistic black-box approach to assessing RAG systems, especially in real-world deployment scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce SCARF (System for Comprehensive Assessment of RAG Frameworks), a modular and flexible evaluation framework designed to benchmark deployed RAG applications systematically. SCARF provides an end-to-end, black-box evaluation methodology, enabling a limited-effort comparison across diverse RAG frameworks. Our framework supports multiple deployment configurations and facilitates automated testing across vector databases and LLM serving strategies, producing a detailed performance report. Moreover, SCARF integrates practical considerations such as response coherence, providing a scalable and adaptable solution for researchers and industry professionals evaluating RAG applications. Using the REST APIs interface, we demonstrate how SCARF can be applied to real-world scenarios, showcasing its flexibility in assessing different RAG frameworks and configurations. SCARF is available at GitHub repository.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report, 7 pages, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Given the overwhelming volume and inherent complexity of scientific collections, conventional search systems often lack necessary intuitiveness and interactivity, presenting substantial barriers for learners, educators, and researchers. CollEx addresses these limitations by employing state-of-the-art Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) as multimodal agents accessible through an intuitive chat interface. By abstracting complex interactions via specialized agents equipped with advanced tools, CollEx facilitates curiosity-driven exploration, significantly simplifying access to diverse scientific collections and records therein. Our system integrates textual and visual modalities, supporting educational scenarios that are helpful for teachers, pupils, students, and researchers by fostering independent exploration as well as scientific excitement and curiosity. Furthermore, CollEx serves the research community by discovering interdisciplinary connections and complementing visual data. We illustrate the effectiveness of our system through a proof-of-concept application containing over 64,000 unique records across 32 collections from a local scientific collection from a public university.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging LLMs for Utility-Focused Annotation: Reducing Manual Effort for Retrieval and RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05220v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval models typically rely on costly human-labeled query-document relevance annotations for training and evaluation. To reduce this cost and leverage the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in relevance judgments, we aim to explore whether LLM-generated annotations can effectively replace human annotations in training retrieval models. Retrieval usually emphasizes relevance, which indicates "topic-relatedness" of a document to a query, while in RAG, the value of a document (or utility) depends on how it contributes to answer generation. Recognizing this mismatch, some researchers use LLM performance on downstream tasks with documents as labels, but this approach requires manual answers for specific tasks, leading to high costs and limited generalization. In another line of work, prompting LLMs to select useful documents as RAG references eliminates the need for human annotation and is not task-specific. If we leverage LLMs' utility judgments to annotate retrieval data, we may retain cross-task generalization without human annotation in large-scale corpora. Therefore, we investigate utility-focused annotation via LLMs for large-scale retriever training data across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings on the retrieval and RAG tasks. To reduce the impact of low-quality positives labeled by LLMs, we design a novel loss function, i.e., Disj-InfoNCE. Our experiments reveal that: (1) Retrievers trained on utility-focused annotations significantly outperform those trained on human annotations in the out-of-domain setting on both tasks, demonstrating superior generalization capabilities. (2) LLM annotation does not replace human annotation in the in-domain setting. However, incorporating just 20% human-annotated data enables retrievers trained with utility-focused annotations to match the performance of models trained entirely with human annotations.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Diversity Enhances an LLM's Performance in RAG and Long-context Task](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09017v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the challenge of context window limitations, primarily due to the quadratic time complexity of the self-attention mechanism (\(O(N^2)\), where \(N\) denotes the context window length). This constraint impacts tasks such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in question answering (Q\&A) and long context summarization. A common approach involves selecting content with the highest similarity to the query; however, this often leads to redundancy and the exclusion of diverse yet relevant information. Building on principles from Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) and Farthest Point Sampling (FPS), we integrate diversity into the content selection process. Our findings reveal that incorporating diversity substantially increases the recall of selecting relevant sentences or chunks before LLM-based Q\&A and summarization. These results highlight the importance of maintaining diversity in future LLM applications to further improve summarization and Q\&A outcomes.</p></details> |  |

While hierarchical planning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) address some of these challenges, they remain insufficient on their own and a deeper integration is required for achieving more reliable systems. To this end, we propose a neuro-symbolic approach that enhances LLMs-based planners with Knowledge Graph-based RAG for hierarchical plan generation. This method decomposes complex tasks into manageable subtasks, further expanded into executable atomic action sequences. To ensure formal correctness and proper decomposition, we integrate a Symbolic Validator, which also functions as a failure detector by aligning expected and observed world states. Our evaluation against baseline methods demonstrates the consistent significant advantages of integrating hierarchical planning, symbolic verification, and RAG across tasks of varying complexity and different LLMs. Additionally, our experimental setup and novel metrics not only validate our approach for complex planning but also serve as a tool for assessing LLMs' reasoning and compositional capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Accurate and efficient scenario data search is critical for both online vehicle decision-making and planning, and offline scenario generation and simulations, as it allows for leveraging the scenario experiences to improve the overall performance. Especially with the application of large language models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) systems in autonomous driving, urgent requirements are put forward. In this paper, we introduce the Driving-RAG framework to address the challenges of efficient scenario data embedding, search, and applications for RAG systems. Our embedding model aligns fundamental scenario information and scenario distance metrics in the vector space. The typical scenario sampling method combined with hierarchical navigable small world can perform efficient scenario vector search to achieve high efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. In addition, the reorganization mechanism by graph knowledge enhances the relevance to the prompt scenarios and augment LLM generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on typical trajectory planning task for complex interactive scenarios such as ramps and intersections, showcasing its advantages for RAG applications.</p></details> |  |

We extend our previous work on AI-assisted programming, which supports code auto-completion and chatbot-powered Q&A, to the realm of software testing. We introduce Copilot for Testing, an automated testing system that synchronizes bug detection with codebase updates, leveraging context-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance the capabilities of large language models (LLMs).

Producing such semantic co-speech gestures has been a major challenge for the existing neural systems that can generate rhythmic beat gestures, but struggle to produce semantically meaningful gestures. Therefore, we present RAG-Gesture, a diffusion-based gesture generation approach that leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce natural-looking and semantically rich gestures. Our neuro-explicit gesture generation approach is designed to produce semantic gestures grounded in interpretable linguistic knowledge. We achieve this by using explicit domain knowledge to retrieve exemplar motions from a database of co-speech gestures. Once retrieved, we then inject these semantic exemplar gestures into our diffusion-based gesture generation pipeline using DDIM inversion and retrieval guidance at the inference time without any need of training. Further, we propose a control paradigm for guidance, that allows the users to modulate the amount of influence each retrieval insertion has over the generated sequence. Our comparative evaluations demonstrate the validity of our approach against recent gesture generation approaches. The reader is urged to explore the results on our project page.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

| **[CacheBlend: Fast Large Language Model Serving for RAG with Cached Knowledge Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16444v3)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often incorporate multiple text chunks in their inputs to provide the necessary contexts. To speed up the prefill of the long LLM inputs, one can pre-compute the KV cache of a text and re-use the KV cache when the context is reused as the prefix of another LLM input. However, the reused text chunks are not always the input prefix, which makes precomputed KV caches not directly usable since they ignore the text's cross-attention with the preceding texts. Thus, the benefits of reusing KV caches remain largely unrealized. This paper tackles just one challenge: when an LLM input contains multiple text chunks, how to quickly combine their precomputed KV caches in order to achieve the same generation quality as the expensive full prefill (i.e., without reusing KV cache)? This challenge naturally arises in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) where the input is supplemented with multiple retrieved texts as the context. We present CacheBlend, a scheme that reuses the precomputed KV caches, regardless prefix or not, and selectively recomputes the KV values of a small subset of tokens to partially update each reused KV cache. In the meantime, the small extra delay for recomputing some tokens can be pipelined with the retrieval of KV caches within the same job, allowing CacheBlend to store KV caches in slower devices with more storage capacity while retrieving them without increasing the inference delay. By comparing CacheBlend with the state-of-the-art KV cache reusing schemes on three open-source LLMs of various sizes and four popular benchmark datasets of different tasks, we show that CacheBlend reduces time-to-first-token (TTFT) by 2.2-3.3x and increases the inference throughput by 2.8-5x from full KV recompute without compromising generation quality.

In real-world scenarios, user questions often require retrieving answers that are distributed across multiple tables. GraphRAG has recently attracted much attention for enhancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities by organizing external knowledge to address ad-hoc and complex questions, exemplifying a promising direction for cross-table question answering. In this paper, to address the current gap in available data, we first introduce a multi-table benchmark, MutliTableQA, comprising 60k tables and 25k user queries collected from real-world sources. Then, we propose the first Graph-Table-RAG framework, namely GTR, which reorganizes table corpora into a heterogeneous graph, employs a hierarchical coarse-to-fine retrieval process to extract the most relevant tables, and integrates graph-aware prompting for downstream LLMs' tabular reasoning. Extensive experiments show that GTR exhibits superior cross-table question-answering performance while maintaining high deployment efficiency, demonstrating its real-world practical applicability.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |

Large language models (LLMs) have made it significantly easier to prototype such retrieval and reasoning data pipelines. However, implementing these pipelines efficiently still demands significant effort and has several challenges. This often involves orchestrating heterogeneous data systems, managing data movement, and handling low-level implementation details, e.g., LLM context management. To address these challenges, we introduce FlockMTL: an extension for DBMSs that deeply integrates LLM capabilities and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). FlockMTL includes model-driven scalar and aggregate functions, enabling chained predictions through tuple-level mappings and reductions. Drawing inspiration from the relational model, FlockMTL incorporates: (i) cost-based optimizations, which seamlessly apply techniques such as batching and caching; and (ii) resource independence, enabled through novel SQL DDL abstractions: PROMPT and MODEL, introduced as first-class schema objects alongside TABLE. FlockMTL streamlines the development of knowledge-intensive analytical applications, and its optimizations ease the implementation burden.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Routing RAG: Binding Selective Retrieval with Knowledge Verbalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01018v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Selective retrieval improves retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by reducing distractions from low-quality retrievals and improving efficiency. However, existing approaches under-utilize the inherent knowledge of large language models (LLMs), leading to suboptimal retrieval decisions and degraded generation performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Self-Routing RAG (SR-RAG), a novel framework that binds selective retrieval with knowledge verbalization. SR-RAG enables an LLM to dynamically decide between external retrieval and verbalizing its own parametric knowledge. To this end, we design a multi-task objective that jointly optimizes an LLM on knowledge source selection, knowledge verbalization, and response generation. We further introduce dynamic knowledge source inference via nearest neighbor search to improve the accuracy of knowledge source decision under domain shifts. Fine-tuning three LLMs with SR-RAG significantly improves both their response accuracy and inference latency. Compared to the strongest selective retrieval baseline, SR-RAG reduces retrievals by 29% while improving the performance by 5.1%.</p></details> | Work in Progress |

RAG primarily relies on the query-chunk text-to-text similarity in the embedding space for retrieval and can fail to capture deeper semantic relationships across chunks, is highly sensitive to chunking strategies, and is prone to hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose TOBUGraph, a graph-based retrieval framework that first constructs the knowledge graph from unstructured data dynamically and automatically. Using LLMs, TOBUGraph extracts structured knowledge and diverse relationships among data, going beyond RAG's text-to-text similarity. Retrieval is achieved through graph traversal, leveraging the extracted relationships and structures to enhance retrieval accuracy, eliminating the need for chunking configurations while reducing hallucination. We demonstrate TOBUGraph's effectiveness in TOBU, a real-world application in production for personal memory organization and retrieval. Our evaluation using real user data demonstrates that TOBUGraph outperforms multiple RAG implementations in both precision and recall, significantly improving user experience through improved retrieval accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contradiction Detection in RAG Systems: Evaluating LLMs as Context Validators for Improved Information Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00180v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have emerged as a powerful method for enhancing large language models (LLMs) with up-to-date information. However, the retrieval step in RAG can sometimes surface documents containing contradictory information, particularly in rapidly evolving domains such as news. These contradictions can significantly impact the performance of LLMs, leading to inconsistent or erroneous outputs. This study addresses this critical challenge in two ways. First, we present a novel data generation framework to simulate different types of contradictions that may occur in the retrieval stage of a RAG system. Second, we evaluate the robustness of different LLMs in performing as context validators, assessing their ability to detect contradictory information within retrieved document sets. Our experimental results reveal that context validation remains a challenging task even for state-of-the-art LLMs, with performance varying significantly across different types of contradictions. While larger models generally perform better at contradiction detection, the effectiveness of different prompting strategies varies across tasks and model architectures. We find that chain-of-thought prompting shows notable improvements for some models but may hinder performance in others, highlighting the complexity of the task and the need for more robust approaches to context validation in RAG systems.</p></details> |  |

Using LLaMA 3, we evaluate these approaches on emotion classification and mental health condition detection tasks across two datasets. Fine-tuning achieves the highest accuracy (91% for emotion classification, 80% for mental health conditions) but requires substantial computational resources and large training sets, while prompt engineering and RAG offer more flexible deployment with moderate performance (40-68% accuracy). Our findings provide practical insights for implementing LLM-based solutions in mental health applications, highlighting the trade-offs between accuracy, computational requirements, and deployment flexibility.</p></details> |  |

A robust benchmark dataset must satisfy three key criteria: quality, diversity, and difficulty, which capturing the complexity of reasoning based on hops and the distribution of supporting evidence. In this paper, we propose MHTS (Multi-Hop Tree Structure), a novel dataset synthesis framework that systematically controls multi-hop reasoning complexity by leveraging a multi-hop tree structure to generate logically connected, multi-chunk queries. Our fine-grained difficulty estimation formula exhibits a strong correlation with the overall performance metrics of a RAG system, validating its effectiveness in assessing both retrieval and answer generation capabilities. By ensuring high-quality, diverse, and difficulty-controlled queries, our approach enhances RAG evaluation and benchmarking capabilities.</p></details> |  |

However, LLMs are generalized models, trained on extensive text corpus, and often struggle to provide context-specific information, particularly in areas requiring specialized knowledge, such as wildfire details within the broader context of climate change. For decision-makers focused on wildfire resilience and adaptation, it is crucial to obtain responses that are not only precise but also domain-specific. To that end, we developed WildfireGPT, a prototype LLM agent designed to transform user queries into actionable insights on wildfire risks. We enrich WildfireGPT by providing additional context, such as climate projections and scientific literature, to ensure its information is current, relevant, and scientifically accurate. This enables WildfireGPT to be an effective tool for delivering detailed, user-specific insights on wildfire risks to support a diverse set of end users, including but not limited to researchers and engineers, for making positive impact and decision making.</p></details> | <details><summary>resto...</summary><p>restoring content for arXiv:2402.07877v2 which was replaced in error</p></details> |
| **[Systematic Knowledge Injection into Large Language Models via Diverse Augmentation for Domain-Specific RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08356v3)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a prominent method for incorporating domain knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs). While RAG enhances response relevance by incorporating retrieved domain knowledge in the context, retrieval errors can still lead to hallucinations and incorrect answers. To recover from retriever failures, domain knowledge is injected by fine-tuning the model to generate the correct response, even in the case of retrieval errors. However, we observe that without systematic knowledge augmentation, fine-tuned LLMs may memorize new information but still fail to extract relevant domain knowledge, leading to poor performance. In this work, we present a novel framework that significantly enhances the fine-tuning process by augmenting the training data in two ways -- context augmentation and knowledge paraphrasing. In context augmentation, we create multiple training samples for a given QA pair by varying the relevance of the retrieved information, teaching the model when to ignore and when to rely on retrieved content. In knowledge paraphrasing, we fine-tune with multiple answers to the same question, enabling LLMs to better internalize specialized knowledge. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting due to fine-tuning, we add a domain-specific identifier to a question and also utilize a replay buffer containing general QA pairs. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our method over existing techniques, achieving up to 10\% relative gain in token-level recall while preserving the LLM's generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 14 tables, to be published in NAACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[Does RAG Introduce Unfairness in LLMs? Evaluating Fairness in Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19804v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has recently gained significant attention for its enhanced ability to integrate external knowledge sources into open-domain question answering (QA) tasks. However, it remains unclear how these models address fairness concerns, particularly with respect to sensitive attributes such as gender, geographic location, and other demographic factors. First, as language models evolve to prioritize utility, like improving exact match accuracy, fairness considerations may have been largely overlooked. Second, the complex, multi-component architecture of RAG methods poses challenges in identifying and mitigating biases, as each component is optimized for distinct objectives. In this paper, we aim to empirically evaluate fairness in several RAG methods. We propose a fairness evaluation framework tailored to RAG, using scenario-based questions and analyzing disparities across demographic attributes. Our experimental results indicate that, despite recent advances in utility-driven optimization, fairness issues persist in both the retrieval and generation stages. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions to address fairness concerns throughout the RAG pipeline. The dataset and code used in this study are publicly available at this GitHub Repository https://github.com/elviswxy/RAG_fairness .</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at COLING 2025</p></details> |
| **[Improving RAG for Personalization with Author Features and Contrastive Examples](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08745v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalization with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) often fails to capture fine-grained features of authors, making it hard to identify their unique traits. To enrich the RAG context, we propose providing Large Language Models (LLMs) with author-specific features, such as average sentiment polarity and frequently used words, in addition to past samples from the author's profile. We introduce a new feature called Contrastive Examples: documents from other authors are retrieved to help LLM identify what makes an author's style unique in comparison to others. Our experiments show that adding a couple of sentences about the named entities, dependency patterns, and words a person uses frequently significantly improves personalized text generation. Combining features with contrastive examples boosts the performance further, achieving a relative 15% improvement over baseline RAG while outperforming the benchmarks. Our results show the value of fine-grained features for better personalization, while opening a new research dimension for including contrastive examples as a complement with RAG. We release our code publicly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Balancing Content Size in RAG-Text2SQL System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15723v3)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising solution for converting natural language queries into SQL commands, enabling seamless database interaction. However, these Text-to-SQL (Text2SQL) systems face inherent limitations, hallucinations, outdated knowledge, and untraceable reasoning. To address these challenges, the integration of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with Text2SQL models has gained traction. RAG serves as a retrieval mechanism, providing essential contextual information, such as table schemas and metadata, to enhance the query generation process. Despite their potential, RAG + Text2SQL systems are susceptible to the quality and size of retrieved documents. While richer document content can improve schema relevance and retrieval accuracy, it also introduces noise, increasing the risk of hallucinations and reducing query fidelity as the prompt size of the Text2SQL model increases. This research investigates the nuanced trade-off between document size and quality, aiming to strike a balance that optimizes system performance. Key thresholds are identified where performance degradation occurs, along with actionable strategies to mitigate these challenges. Additionally, we explore the phenomenon of hallucinations in Text2SQL models, emphasizing the critical role of curated document presentation in minimizing errors. Our findings provide a roadmap for enhancing the robustness of RAG + Text2SQL systems, offering practical insights for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[ExpertRAG: Efficient RAG with Mixture of Experts -- Optimizing Context Retrieval for Adaptive LLM Responses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08744v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>ExpertRAG is a novel theoretical framework that integrates Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to advance the efficiency and accuracy of knowledge-intensive language modeling. We propose a dynamic retrieval gating mechanism coupled with expert routing, enabling the model to selectively consult an external knowledge store or rely on specialized internal experts based on the query's needs. The paper lays out the theoretical foundations of ExpertRAG, including a probabilistic formulation that treats retrieval and expert selection as latent decisions, and mathematical justifications for its efficiency in both computation and knowledge utilization. We derive formulae to quantify the expected computational cost savings from selective retrieval and the capacity gains from sparse expert utilization. A comparative analysis positions ExpertRAG against standard RAG (with always-on retrieval) and pure MoE models (e.g., Switch Transformer, Mixtral) to highlight its unique balance between parametric knowledge and non-parametric retrieval. We also outline an experimental validation strategy, proposing benchmarks and evaluation protocols to test ExpertRAG's performance on factual recall, generalization, and inference efficiency. The proposed framework, although presented theoretically, is supported by insights from prior work in RAG and MoE, and is poised to provide more factual, efficient, and adaptive generation by leveraging the best of both paradigms. In summary, ExpertRAG contributes a new perspective on scaling and augmenting language models, backed by a thorough analysis and a roadmap for empirical validation.</p></details> | 30 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Tuning LLMs by RAG Principles: Towards LLM-native Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16071v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Memory, additional information beyond the training of large language models (LLMs), is crucial to various real-world applications, such as personal assistant. The two mainstream solutions to incorporate memory into the generation process are long-context LLMs and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). In this paper, we first systematically compare these two types of solutions on three renovated/new datasets and show that (1) long-context solutions, although more expensive, shall be easier to capture the big picture and better answer queries which require considering the memory as a whole; and (2) when the queries concern specific information, RAG solutions shall be more competitive especially when the keywords can be explicitly matched. Therefore, we propose a novel method RAG-Tuned-LLM which fine-tunes a relative small (e.g., 7B) LLM using the data generated following the RAG principles, so it can combine the advantages of both solutions. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that RAG-Tuned-LLM can beat long-context LLMs and RAG methods across a wide range of query types.</p></details> |  |

We incorporate a LLM feedback mechanism to improve the quality of the generated content and propose an LLM-as-a-judge approach for evaluation.

The recent purposed Mixed-Precision Over-the-Air Federated Learning (MP-OTA-FL) enables clients to operate at appropriate precision levels based on their heterogeneous hardware, taking advantages of the larger trade-off space while covering the quantization overheads in the mixed-precision modulation scheme for the OTA aggregation process. A key to further exploring the potential of the MP-OTA-FL framework is the optimization of client precision levels. The choice of precision level hinges on multifaceted factors including hardware capability, potential client contribution, and user satisfaction, among which factors can be difficult to define or quantify. In this paper, we propose a RAG-based User Profiling for precision planning framework that integrates retrieval-augmented LLMs and dynamic client profiling to optimize satisfaction and contributions. This includes a hybrid interface for gathering device/user insights and an RAG database storing historical quantization decisions with feedback. Experiments show that our method boosts satisfaction, energy savings, and global model accuracy in MP-OTA-FL systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, submitted to IEEE VTC 2025 fall for possible publication</p></details> |

Chatbots as question-answering systems can help in solving these challenges. LLM chatbots use NLP techniques to establish connections between topics and accurately respond to complex questions. These capabilities make it perfect for enlightenment on religion as a question-answering chatbot. However, LLMs also tend to generate false information, known as hallucination. Also, the chatbots' responses can include content that insults personal religious beliefs, interfaith conflicts, and controversial or sensitive topics. It must avoid such cases without promoting hate speech or offending certain groups of people or their beliefs. This study uses a vector database-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to enhance the accuracy and transparency of LLMs. Our question-answering system is called "MufassirQAS". We created a database consisting of several open-access books that include Turkish context. These books contain Turkish translations and interpretations of Islam. This database is utilized to answer religion-related questions and ensure our answers are trustworthy. The relevant part of the dataset, which LLM also uses, is presented along with the answer. We have put careful effort into creating system prompts that give instructions to prevent harmful, offensive, or disrespectful responses to respect people's values and provide reliable results. The system answers and shares additional information, such as the page number from the respective book and the articles referenced for obtaining the information. MufassirQAS and ChatGPT are also tested with sensitive questions. We got better performance with our system. Study and enhancements are still in progress. Results and future works are given.</p></details> |  |
| **[SOSecure: Safer Code Generation with RAG and StackOverflow Discussions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13654v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for automated code generation. Their reliance on infrequently updated pretraining data leaves them unaware of newly discovered vulnerabilities and evolving security standards, making them prone to producing insecure code. In contrast, developer communities on Stack Overflow (SO) provide an ever-evolving repository of knowledge, where security vulnerabilities are actively discussed and addressed through collective expertise. These community-driven insights remain largely untapped by LLMs. This paper introduces SOSecure, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that leverages the collective security expertise found in SO discussions to improve the security of LLM-generated code. We build a security-focused knowledge base by extracting SO answers and comments that explicitly identify vulnerabilities. Unlike common uses of RAG, SOSecure triggers after code has been generated to find discussions that identify flaws in similar code. These are used in a prompt to an LLM to consider revising the code. Evaluation across three datasets (SALLM, LLMSecEval, and LMSys) show that SOSecure achieves strong fix rates of 71.7%, 91.3%, and 96.7% respectively, compared to prompting GPT-4 without relevant discussions (49.1%, 56.5%, and 37.5%), and outperforms multiple other baselines. SOSecure operates as a language-agnostic complement to existing LLMs, without requiring retraining or fine-tuning, making it easy to deploy. Our results underscore the importance of maintaining active developer forums, which have dropped substantially in usage with LLM adoptions.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we proposed MES-RAG framework, which enhances entity-specific query handling and provides accurate, secure, and consistent responses. MES-RAG introduces proactive security measures that ensure system integrity by applying protections prior to data access. Additionally, the system supports real-time multi-modal outputs, including text, images, audio, and video, seamlessly integrating into existing RAG architectures. Experimental results demonstrate that MES-RAG significantly improves both accuracy and recall, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing the security and utility of question-answering, increasing accuracy to 0.83 (+0.25) on targeted task.

| **[Privacy-Aware RAG: Secure and Isolated Knowledge Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15548v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in real-world applications has heightened concerns about the confidentiality and integrity of their proprietary knowledge bases. These knowledge bases, which play a critical role in enhancing the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly vulnerable to breaches that could compromise sensitive information. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an advanced encryption methodology designed to protect RAG systems from unauthorized access and data leakage. Our approach encrypts both textual content and its corresponding embeddings prior to storage, ensuring that all data remains securely encrypted. This mechanism restricts access to authorized entities with the appropriate decryption keys, thereby significantly reducing the risk of unintended data exposure. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our encryption strategy preserves the performance and functionality of RAG pipelines, ensuring compatibility across diverse domains and applications. To validate the robustness of our method, we provide comprehensive security proofs that highlight its resilience against potential threats and vulnerabilities. These proofs also reveal limitations in existing approaches, which often lack robustness, adaptability, or reliance on open-source models. Our findings suggest that integrating advanced encryption techniques into the design and deployment of RAG systems can effectively enhance privacy safeguards. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on improving security measures for AI-driven services and advocates for stricter data protection standards within RAG architectures.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advancements, LLMs still face significant challenges in reasoning with structured data, handling dynamic knowledge evolution, and mitigating hallucinations, particularly in mission-critical domains. Our proposed RAG-KG-IL framework addresses these limitations by employing a multi-agent architecture that enables continuous knowledge updates, integrates structured knowledge, and incorporates autonomous agents for enhanced explainability and reasoning. The framework utilizes RAG to ensure the generated responses are grounded in verifiable information, while KGs provide structured domain knowledge for improved consistency and depth of understanding. The Incremental Learning approach allows for dynamic updates to the knowledge base without full retraining, significantly reducing computational overhead and improving the model's adaptability. We evaluate the framework using real-world case studies involving health-related queries, comparing it to state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o and a RAG-only baseline. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces hallucination rates and improves answer completeness and reasoning accuracy. The results underscore the potential of combining RAG, KGs, and multi-agent systems to create intelligent, adaptable systems capable of real-time knowledge integration and reasoning in complex domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Relevance Isn't All You Need: Scaling RAG Systems With Inference-Time Compute Via Multi-Criteria Reranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07104v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern Large Language Model (LLM) systems typically rely on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) which aims to gather context that is useful for response generation. These RAG systems typically optimize strictly towards retrieving context that is maximally relevant to the query. However, conventional theory suggests that retrieval systems which seek to maximize context relevance without any additional explicit criteria can create information bottlenecks. We reaffirm this finding in the modern age of LLM's by showing that in standard RAG pipelines, maximizing for context relevance alone can degrade downstream response quality. In response, we show evaluations of existing RAG methods which account for both context relevance and answer quality. These evaluations introduce a novel finding that existing RAG systems scale poorly with inference time compute usage when considering our combined metric. We introduce "RErank BEyond reLevance (REBEL)", which enables RAG systems to scale with inference-time compute via injection of multi-criteria optimization using Chain-of-Thought prompting (and optionally Multi-Turn dialogue). Ultimately, this enables a new performance/speed tradeoff curve, where RAG systems are able to achieve both higher relevance of retrieved contexts and superior answer quality as inference time increases. Code for the implementation of our method in llama-index can be found at the following PR: https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/pull/17590. Code for running experiments using this llama-index implementation can be found at https://github.com/microsoft/REBEL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taxonomic Reasoning for Rare Arthropods: Combining Dense Image Captioning and RAG for Interpretable Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10886v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of pressing climate change challenges and the significant biodiversity loss among arthropods, automated taxonomic classification from organismal images is a subject of intense research. However, traditional AI pipelines based on deep neural visual architectures such as CNNs or ViTs face limitations such as degraded performance on the long-tail of classes and the inability to reason about their predictions. We integrate image captioning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) to enhance biodiversity monitoring, showing particular promise for characterizing rare and unknown arthropod species. While a naive Vision-Language Model (VLM) excels in classifying images of common species, the RAG model enables classification of rarer taxa by matching explicit textual descriptions of taxonomic features to contextual biodiversity text data from external sources. The RAG model shows promise in reducing overconfidence and enhancing accuracy relative to naive LLMs, suggesting its viability in capturing the nuances of taxonomic hierarchy, particularly at the challenging family and genus levels. Our findings highlight the potential for modern vision-language AI pipelines to support biodiversity conservation initiatives, emphasizing the role of comprehensive data curation and collaboration with citizen science platforms to improve species identification, unknown species characterization and ultimately inform conservation strategies.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |

In the Query-Focused Summarization (QFS) task, GraphRAG-based approaches have notably enhanced the comprehensiveness and diversity of generated responses. However, existing GraphRAG-based approaches predominantly focus on coarse-grained information summarization without being aware of the specific query, and the retrieved content lacks sufficient contextual information to generate comprehensive responses. To address the deficiencies of current RAG systems, we propose Context-Aware Fine-Grained Graph RAG (FG-RAG) to enhance the performance of the QFS task. FG-RAG employs Context-Aware Entity Expansion in graph retrieval to expand the coverage of retrieved entities in the graph, thus providing enough contextual information for the retrieved content. Furthermore, FG-RAG utilizes Query-Level Fine-Grained Summarization to incorporate fine-grained details during response generation, enhancing query awareness for the generated summarization. Our evaluation demonstrates that FG-RAG outperforms other RAG systems in multiple metrics of comprehensiveness, diversity, and empowerment when handling the QFS task. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/BuptWululu/FG-RAG.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces ClaimTrust, a propagation-based trust scoring framework that dynamically evaluates the reliability of documents in a RAG system. Using a modified PageRank-inspired algorithm, ClaimTrust propagates trust scores across documents based on relationships derived from extracted factual claims. We preprocess and analyze 814 political news articles from Kaggle's Fake News Detection Dataset to extract 2,173 unique claims and classify 965 meaningful relationships (supporting or contradicting). By representing the dataset as a document graph, ClaimTrust iteratively updates trust scores until convergence, effectively differentiating trustworthy articles from unreliable ones. Our methodology, which leverages embedding-based filtering for efficient claim comparison and relationship classification, achieves a 11.2% of significant connections while maintaining computational scalability. Experimental results demonstrate that ClaimTrust successfully assigns higher trust scores to verified documents while penalizing those containing false information. Future directions include fine-tuned claim extract and compare (Li et al., 2022), parameter optimization, enhanced language model utilization, and robust evaluation metrics to generalize the framework across diverse datasets and domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

To effectively assess their video comprehension capabilities, long video understanding benchmarks, such as Video-MME and MLVU, are proposed. However, these benchmarks directly use uniform frame sampling for testing, which results in significant information loss and affects the accuracy of the evaluations in reflecting the true abilities of MLLMs. To address this, we propose RAG-Adapter, a plug-and-play framework that reduces information loss during testing by sampling frames most relevant to the given question. Additionally, we introduce a Grouped-supervised Contrastive Learning (GCL) method to further enhance sampling effectiveness of RAG-Adapter through fine-tuning on our constructed MMAT dataset. Finally, we test numerous baseline MLLMs on various video understanding benchmarks, finding that RAG-Adapter sampling consistently outperforms uniform sampling (e.g., Accuracy of GPT-4o increases by 9.3 percent on Video-MME), providing a more accurate testing method for long video benchmarks.</p></details> | 37 pages, 36 figures |

Predictive maintenance (PdM) in such settings demands methodologies that are adaptive, transferable, and capable of integrating domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we present RAAD-LLM, a novel framework for adaptive anomaly detection, leveraging large language models (LLMs) integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This approach addresses the aforementioned PdM challenges. By effectively utilizing domain-specific knowledge, RAAD-LLM enhances the detection of anomalies in time series data without requiring fine-tuning on specific datasets. The framework's adaptability mechanism enables it to adjust its understanding of normal operating conditions dynamically, thus increasing detection accuracy. We validate this methodology through a real-world application for a plastics manufacturing plant and the Skoltech Anomaly Benchmark (SKAB). Results show significant improvements over our previous model with an accuracy increase from 70.7% to 88.6% on the real-world dataset. By allowing for the enriching of input series data with semantics, RAAD-LLM incorporates multimodal capabilities that facilitate more collaborative decision-making between the model and plant operators. Overall, our findings support RAAD-LLM's ability to revolutionize anomaly detection methodologies in PdM, potentially leading to a paradigm shift in how anomaly detection is implemented across various industries.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2411.00914</p></details> |

To bridge this gap, we introduce OpenRAG, a RAG framework that is optimized end-to-end by tuning the retriever to capture in-context relevance, enabling adaptation to the diverse and evolving needs. Extensive experiments across a wide range of tasks demonstrate that OpenRAG, by tuning a retriever end-to-end, leads to a consistent improvement of 4.0% over the original retriever, consistently outperforming existing state-of-the-art retrievers by 2.1%. Additionally, our results indicate that for some tasks, an end-to-end tuned 0.2B retriever can achieve improvements that surpass those of RAG-oriented or instruction-tuned 8B large language models (LLMs), highlighting the cost-effectiveness of our approach in enhancing RAG systems.</p></details> |  |

As an essential part of RAG, external knowledge bases are commonly built by extracting structured data from unstructured PDF documents using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However, given the imperfect prediction of OCR and the inherent non-uniform representation of structured data, knowledge bases inevitably contain various OCR noises. In this paper, we introduce OHRBench, the first benchmark for understanding the cascading impact of OCR on RAG systems. OHRBench includes 8,561 carefully selected unstructured document images from seven real-world RAG application domains, along with 8,498 Q&A pairs derived from multimodal elements in documents, challenging existing OCR solutions used for RAG. To better understand OCR's impact on RAG systems, we identify two primary types of OCR noise: Semantic Noise and Formatting Noise and apply perturbation to generate a set of structured data with varying degrees of each OCR noise. Using OHRBench, we first conduct a comprehensive evaluation of current OCR solutions and reveal that none is competent for constructing high-quality knowledge bases for RAG systems. We then systematically evaluate the impact of these two noise types and demonstrate the trend relationship between the degree of OCR noise and RAG performance. Our OHRBench, including PDF documents, Q&As, and the ground truth structured data are released at: https://github.com/opendatalab/OHR-Bench</p></details> | Work in progress |

We demonstrate that RAG systems that operate on databases with untrusted content are vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks we call jamming. An adversary can add a single ``blocker'' document to the database that will be retrieved in response to a specific query and result in the RAG system not answering this query, ostensibly because it lacks relevant information or because the answer is unsafe. We describe and measure the efficacy of several methods for generating blocker documents, including a new method based on black-box optimization. Our method (1) does not rely on instruction injection, (2) does not require the adversary to know the embedding or LLM used by the target RAG system, and (3) does not employ an auxiliary LLM. We evaluate jamming attacks on several embeddings and LLMs and demonstrate that the existing safety metrics for LLMs do not capture their vulnerability to jamming. We then discuss defenses against blocker documents.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in USENIX Security Symposium 2025</p></details> |

However, the specialized nature of biochemical data often necessitates costly domain-specific fine-tuning, posing critical challenges. First, it hinders the application of more flexible general-purpose LLMs in cutting-edge drug discovery tasks. More importantly, it impedes the rapid integration of the vast amounts of scientific data continuously generated through experiments and research. To investigate these challenges, we propose CLADD, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-empowered agentic system tailored to drug discovery tasks. Through the collaboration of multiple LLM agents, CLADD dynamically retrieves information from biomedical knowledge bases, contextualizes query molecules, and integrates relevant evidence to generate responses -- all without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. Crucially, we tackle key obstacles in applying RAG workflows to biochemical data, including data heterogeneity, ambiguity, and multi-source integration. We demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of this framework across a variety of drug discovery tasks, showing that it outperforms general-purpose and domain-specific LLMs as well as traditional deep learning approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Machi...</summary><p>Machine Learning, Drug Discovery</p></details> |

However, these modules are usually separately trained. We argue that a system like RAG that incorporates multiple modules should be jointly optimized to achieve optimal performance. To demonstrate this, we design a specific pipeline called \textbf{SmartRAG} that includes a policy network and a retriever. The policy network can serve as 1) a decision maker that decides when to retrieve, 2) a query rewriter to generate a query most suited to the retriever, and 3) an answer generator that produces the final response with/without the observations. We then propose to jointly optimize the whole system using a reinforcement learning algorithm, with the reward designed to encourage the system to achieve the best performance with minimal retrieval cost. When jointly optimized, all the modules can be aware of how other modules are working and thus find the best way to work together as a complete system. Empirical results demonstrate that the jointly optimized SmartRAG can achieve better performance than separately optimized counterparts.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution to enhance LLMs accuracy by incorporating external knowledge. However, traditional RAG systems struggle with processing complex relational information and multi-step reasoning, limiting their effectiveness in advanced problem-solving tasks. To address these limitations, we propose CogGRAG, a cognition inspired graph-based RAG framework, designed to improve LLMs performance in Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA). Inspired by the human cognitive process of decomposing complex problems and performing self-verification, our framework introduces a three-stage methodology: decomposition, retrieval, and reasoning with self-verification. By integrating these components, CogGRAG enhances the accuracy of LLMs in complex problem solving. We conduct systematic experiments with three LLM backbones on four benchmark datasets, where CogGRAG outperforms the baselines.</p></details> |  |

While RAG enhances MLLMs by grounding responses in query-relevant external knowledge, this reliance poses a critical yet underexplored safety risk: knowledge poisoning attacks, where misinformation or irrelevant knowledge is intentionally injected into external knowledge bases to manipulate model outputs to be incorrect and even harmful. To expose such vulnerabilities in multimodal RAG, we propose MM-PoisonRAG, a novel knowledge poisoning attack framework with two attack strategies: Localized Poisoning Attack (LPA), which injects query-specific misinformation in both text and images for targeted manipulation, and Globalized Poisoning Attack (GPA) to provide false guidance during MLLM generation to elicit nonsensical responses across all queries. We evaluate our attacks across multiple tasks, models, and access settings, demonstrating that LPA successfully manipulates the MLLM to generate attacker-controlled answers, with a success rate of up to 56% on MultiModalQA. Moreover, GPA completely disrupts model generation to 0% accuracy with just a single irrelevant knowledge injection. Our results highlight the urgent need for robust defenses against knowledge poisoning to safeguard multimodal RAG frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/HyeonjeongHa/MM-PoisonRAG</p></details> |
| **[Improving RAG Retrieval via Propositional Content Extraction: a Speech Act Theory Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10654v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When users formulate queries, they often include not only the information they seek, but also pragmatic markers such as interrogative phrasing or polite requests. Although these speech act indicators communicate the user\textquotesingle s intent -- whether it is asking a question, making a request, or stating a fact -- they do not necessarily add to the core informational content of the query itself. This paper investigates whether extracting the underlying propositional content from user utterances -- essentially stripping away the linguistic markers of intent -- can improve retrieval quality in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Drawing upon foundational insights from speech act theory, we propose a practical method for automatically transforming queries into their propositional equivalents before embedding. To assess the efficacy of this approach, we conducted an experimental study involving 63 user queries related to a Brazilian telecommunications news corpus with precomputed semantic embeddings. Results demonstrate clear improvements in semantic similarity between query embeddings and document embeddings at top ranks, confirming that queries stripped of speech act indicators more effectively retrieve relevant content.</p></details> | 19 pages, 4 figures |

Built from heterologous data of NASDAQ 100 companies, FinTMMBench offers three significant advantages. 1) Multi-modal Corpus: It encompasses a hybrid of financial tables, news articles, daily stock prices, and visual technical charts as the corpus. 2) Temporal-aware Questions: Each question requires the retrieval and interpretation of its relevant data over a specific time period, including daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual periods. 3) Diverse Financial Analysis Tasks: The questions involve 10 different tasks, including information extraction, trend analysis, sentiment analysis and event detection, etc. We further propose a novel TMMHybridRAG method, which first leverages LLMs to convert data from other modalities (e.g., tabular, visual and time-series data) into textual format and then incorporates temporal information in each node when constructing graphs and dense indexes. Its effectiveness has been validated in extensive experiments, but notable gaps remain, highlighting the challenges presented by our FinTMMBench.</p></details> | Under review |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) fetches evidence via similarity search, but key information may fall outside top ranked results. Long-context models can process multiple documents but are computationally expensive and limited by context window size. Inspired by students condensing study material for open-book exams, we propose task-aware key-value (KV) cache compression, which compresses external knowledge in a zero- or few-shot setup. This enables LLMs to reason efficiently over a compacted representation of all relevant information. Experiments show our approach outperforms both RAG and task-agnostic compression methods. On LongBench v2, it improves accuracy by up to 7 absolute points over RAG with a 30x compression rate, while reducing inference latency from 0.43s to 0.16s. A synthetic dataset highlights that RAG performs well when sparse evidence suffices, whereas task-aware compression is superior for broad knowledge tasks.</p></details> |  |

Although previous studies noted that retrieving many documents can degrade performance, they did not isolate how the quantity of documents affects performance while controlling for context length. We evaluate various language models on custom datasets derived from a multi-hop QA task. We keep the context length and position of relevant information constant while varying the number of documents, and find that increasing the document count in RAG settings poses significant challenges for LLMs. Additionally, our results indicate that processing multiple documents is a separate challenge from handling long contexts. We also make the datasets and code available: https://github.com/shaharl6000/MoreDocsSameLen .</p></details> | Preprint |

A number of graph-based RAG methods have been proposed in the literature. However, these methods have not been systematically and comprehensively compared under the same experimental settings. In this paper, we first summarize a unified framework to incorporate all graph-based RAG methods from a high-level perspective. We then extensively compare representative graph-based RAG methods over a range of questing-answering (QA) datasets -- from specific questions to abstract questions -- and examine the effectiveness of all methods, providing a thorough analysis of graph-based RAG approaches. As a byproduct of our experimental analysis, we are also able to identify new variants of the graph-based RAG methods over specific QA and abstract QA tasks respectively, by combining existing techniques, which outperform the state-of-the-art methods. Finally, based on these findings, we offer promising research opportunities. We believe that a deeper understanding of the behavior of existing methods can provide new valuable insights for future research.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers an effective method for achieving this by retrieving the most relevant fragments into LLMs. However, the advancements in context window size for LLMs offer an alternative approach, raising the question of whether RAG remains necessary for effectively handling external knowledge. Several existing studies provide inconclusive comparisons between RAG and long-context (LC) LLMs, largely due to limitations in the benchmark designs. In this paper, we present LaRA, a novel benchmark specifically designed to rigorously compare RAG and LC LLMs. LaRA encompasses 2326 test cases across four practical QA task categories and three types of naturally occurring long texts. Through systematic evaluation of seven open-source and four proprietary LLMs, we find that the optimal choice between RAG and LC depends on a complex interplay of factors, including the model's parameter size, long-text capabilities, context length, task type, and the characteristics of the retrieved chunks. Our findings provide actionable guidelines for practitioners to effectively leverage both RAG and LC approaches in developing and deploying LLM applications.

While many studies focus on evaluating the overall quality of end-to-end RAG systems, there is a gap in understanding the appropriateness of LLMs for the RAG task. To address this, we introduce Trust-Score, a holistic metric that evaluates the trustworthiness of LLMs within the RAG framework. Our results show that various prompting methods, such as in-context learning, fail to effectively adapt LLMs to the RAG task as measured by Trust-Score. Consequently, we propose Trust-Align, a method to align LLMs for improved Trust-Score performance. 26 out of 27 models aligned using Trust-Align substantially outperform competitive baselines on ASQA, QAMPARI, and ELI5. Specifically, in LLaMA-3-8b, Trust-Align outperforms FRONT on ASQA (up 12.56), QAMPARI (up 36.04), and ELI5 (up 17.69). Trust-Align also significantly enhances models' ability to correctly refuse and provide quality citations. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of Trust-Align across different open-weight models, including the LLaMA series (1b to 8b), Qwen-2.5 series (0.5b to 7b), and Phi3.5 (3.8b). We release our code at https://github.com/declare-lab/trust-align.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |

However, evaluating the effectiveness of RAG systems in specialized scenarios remains challenging due to the high costs of data construction and the lack of suitable evaluation metrics. This paper introduces RAGEval, a framework designed to assess RAG systems across diverse scenarios by generating high-quality documents, questions, answers, and references through a schema-based pipeline. With a focus on factual accuracy, we propose three novel metrics: Completeness, Hallucination, and Irrelevance to evaluate LLM generated responses rigorously. Experimental results show that RAGEval outperforms zero-shot and one-shot methods in terms of clarity, safety, conformity, and richness of generated samples. Furthermore, the use of LLMs for scoring the proposed metrics demonstrates a high level of consistency with human evaluations. RAGEval establishes a new paradigm for evaluating RAG systems in real-world applications.

| **[SAGE: A Framework of Precise Retrieval for RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01713v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated significant proficiency in conducting question-answering (QA) tasks within a specified corpus. Nonetheless, numerous failure instances of RAG in QA still exist. These failures are not solely attributable to the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs); instead, they predominantly arise from the retrieval of inaccurate information for LLMs due to two limitations: (1) Current RAG methods segment the corpus without considering semantics, making it difficult to find relevant context due to impaired correlation between questions and the segments. (2) There is a trade-off between missing essential context with fewer context retrieved and getting irrelevant context with more context retrieved. In this paper, we introduce a RAG framework (SAGE), to overcome these limitations. First, to address the segmentation issue without considering semantics, we propose to train a semantic segmentation model. This model is trained to segment the corpus into semantically complete chunks. Second, to ensure that only the most relevant chunks are retrieved while the irrelevant ones are ignored, we design a chunk selection algorithm to dynamically select chunks based on the decreasing speed of the relevance score, leading to a more relevant selection. Third, to further ensure the precision of the retrieved chunks, we propose letting LLMs assess whether retrieved chunks are excessive or lacking and then adjust the amount of context accordingly. Experiments show that SAGE outperforms baselines by 61.25% in the quality of QA on average. Moreover, by avoiding retrieving noisy context, SAGE lowers the cost of the tokens consumed in LLM inference and achieves a 49.41% enhancement in cost efficiency on average. Additionally, our work offers valuable insights for boosting RAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retrieval-Augmented Perception: High-Resolution Image Perception Meets Visual RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01222v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-resolution (HR) image perception remains a key challenge in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To overcome the limitations of existing methods, this paper shifts away from prior dedicated heuristic approaches and revisits the most fundamental idea to HR perception by enhancing the long-context capability of MLLMs, driven by recent advances in long-context techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for general LLMs. Towards this end, this paper presents the first study exploring the use of RAG to address HR perception challenges. Specifically, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Perception (RAP), a training-free framework that retrieves and fuses relevant image crops while preserving spatial context using the proposed Spatial-Awareness Layout. To accommodate different tasks, the proposed Retrieved-Exploration Search (RE-Search) dynamically selects the optimal number of crops based on model confidence and retrieval scores. Experimental results on HR benchmarks demonstrate the significant effectiveness of RAP, with LLaVA-v1.5-13B achieving a 43% improvement on $V^*$ Bench and 19% on HR-Bench.</p></details> |  |
| **[MMed-RAG: Versatile Multimodal RAG System for Medical Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13085v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated significant potential in healthcare, particularly in disease diagnosis and treatment planning. Recent progress in Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) has opened up new possibilities for interactive diagnostic tools. However, these models often suffer from factual hallucination, which can lead to incorrect diagnoses. Fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have emerged as methods to address these issues. However, the amount of high-quality data and distribution shifts between training data and deployment data limit the application of fine-tuning methods. Although RAG is lightweight and effective, existing RAG-based approaches are not sufficiently general to different medical domains and can potentially cause misalignment issues, both between modalities and between the model and the ground truth. In this paper, we propose a versatile multimodal RAG system, MMed-RAG, designed to enhance the factuality of Med-LVLMs. Our approach introduces a domain-aware retrieval mechanism, an adaptive retrieved contexts selection method, and a provable RAG-based preference fine-tuning strategy. These innovations make the RAG process sufficiently general and reliable, significantly improving alignment when introducing retrieved contexts. Experimental results across five medical datasets (involving radiology, ophthalmology, pathology) on medical VQA and report generation demonstrate that MMed-RAG can achieve an average improvement of 43.8% in the factual accuracy of Med-LVLMs. Our data and code are available in https://github.com/richard-peng-xia/MMed-RAG.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

In this paper, we propose a generative AI-powered GATE question-answering framework (GATE stands for Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering) that leverages LLMs to explain GATE solutions and support students in their exam preparation. We conducted extensive benchmarking to select the optimal embedding model and LLM, evaluating our framework based on criteria such as latency, faithfulness, and relevance, with additional validation through human evaluation. Our chatbot integrates state-of-the-art embedding models and LLMs to deliver accurate, context-aware responses. Through rigorous experimentation, we identified configurations that balance performance and computational efficiency, ensuring a reliable chatbot to serve students' needs. Additionally, we discuss the challenges faced in data processing and modeling and implemented solutions. Our work explores the application of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for GATE Q/A explanation tasks, and our findings demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and response quality. This research offers practical insights for developing effective AI-driven educational tools while highlighting areas for future enhancement in usability and scalability.</p></details> |  |
| **[ER-RAG: Enhance RAG with ER-Based Unified Modeling of Heterogeneous Data Sources](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06271v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel in question-answering (QA) tasks, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances their precision by incorporating external evidence from diverse sources like web pages, databases, and knowledge graphs. However, current RAG methods rely on agent-specific strategies for individual data sources, posing challenges low-resource or black-box environments and complicates operations when evidence is fragmented across sources. To address these limitations, we propose ER-RAG, a framework that unifies evidence integration across heterogeneous data sources using the Entity-Relationship (ER) model. ER-RAG standardizes entity retrieval and relationship querying through ER-based APIs with GET and JOIN operations. It employs a two-stage generation process: first, a preference optimization module selects optimal sources; second, another module constructs API chains based on source schemas. This unified approach allows efficient fine-tuning and seamless integration across diverse data sources. ER-RAG demonstrated its effectiveness by winning all three tracks of the 2024 KDDCup CRAG Challenge, achieving performance on par with commercial RAG pipelines using an 8B LLM backbone. It outperformed hybrid competitors by 3.1% in LLM score and accelerated retrieval by 5.5X.</p></details> |  |
| **[Post-training an LLM for RAG? Train on Self-Generated Demonstrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10596v2)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with knowledge intensive NLP tasks, such as answering "Who won the latest World Cup?" because the knowledge they learn during training may be insufficient or outdated. Conditioning generation on retrieved documents -- a technique known as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) -- mitigates these shortcomings by allowing the model to leverage in-context information. Practitioners can improve LLM RAG performance by fine-tuning on retrieval-augmented instructions, but must beware that this can cause undesirable model behaviors like hallucinations. We attribute this degradation to the fact that the training data is likely to be out-of-distribution for the model and may suffer from quality issues, such as misalignment between retrievals and target responses (since retrievals are frequently added post-hoc). We propose a recipe for training RAG-enabled LLMs using self-generated demonstrations, thereby avoiding training on out-of-distribution text and integrating retrievals into the LLM responses. We evaluate our method on knowledge intensive question answering (QA) tasks and show that our method teaches LLMs to properly handle in-context retrievals and abstain from questions it will likely get wrong. Compared to conventional RA-IT methods, our method prevents model degradation in non-RAG settings while exhibiting superior QA performance.</p></details> |  |

To address the fragmented evaluation paradigms and limited cases in existing Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH), this paper introduces U-NIAH, a unified framework that systematically compares LLMs and RAG methods in controlled long context settings. Our framework extends beyond traditional NIAH by incorporating multi-needle, long-needle, and needle-in-needle configurations, along with different retrieval settings, while leveraging the synthetic Starlight Academy dataset-a fictional magical universe-to eliminate biases from pre-trained knowledge. Through extensive experiments, we investigate three research questions: (1) performance trade-offs between LLMs and RAG, (2) error patterns in RAG, and (3) RAG's limitations in complex settings. Our findings show that RAG significantly enhances smaller LLMs by mitigating the "lost-in-the-middle" effect and improving robustness, achieving an 82.58% win-rate over LLMs. However, we observe that retrieval noise and reverse chunk ordering degrade performance, while surprisingly, advanced reasoning LLMs exhibit reduced RAG compatibility due to sensitivity to semantic distractors. We identify typical error patterns including omission due to noise, hallucination under high noise critical condition, and self-doubt behaviors. Our work not only highlights the complementary roles of RAG and LLMs, but also provides actionable insights for optimizing deployments.

However, these models face challenges in retrieving precise information from vast datasets. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) was developed to combining LLMs with external information retrieval systems to enhance the accuracy and context of responses. Despite improvements, RAG still struggles with comprehensive retrieval in high-volume, low-information-density databases and lacks relational awareness, leading to fragmented answers. To address this, this paper introduces the Pseudo-Knowledge Graph (PKG) framework, designed to overcome these limitations by integrating Meta-path Retrieval, In-graph Text and Vector Retrieval into LLMs. By preserving natural language text and leveraging various retrieval techniques, the PKG offers a richer knowledge representation and improves accuracy in information retrieval. Extensive evaluations using Open Compass and MultiHop-RAG benchmarks demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in managing large volumes of data and complex relationships.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods rely on unrealistic white-box assumptions, such as attackers having access to RAG systems' internal processes. To address this issue, we introduce a realistic black-box attack scenario based on the RAG paradox, where RAG systems inadvertently expose vulnerabilities while attempting to enhance trustworthiness. Because RAG systems reference external documents during response generation, our attack targets these sources without requiring internal access. Our approach first identifies the external sources disclosed by RAG systems and then automatically generates poisoned documents with misinformation designed to match these sources. Finally, these poisoned documents are newly published on the disclosed sources, disrupting the RAG system's response generation process. Both offline and online experiments confirm that this attack significantly reduces RAG performance without requiring internal access. Furthermore, from an insider perspective within the RAG system, we propose a re-ranking method that acts as a fundamental safeguard, offering minimal protection against unforeseen attacks.</p></details> |  |

Different from traditional RAG methods that mostly deal with flat text chunks, the proposed method takes into account the relationship of multimodalities by using a graph structure. To do that, a graph modeling structure is defined based on document layout parsing. The structure of an input document is retained with the connection of text chunks, tables, and figures. This representation allows the method to handle complex questions that require information from multimodalities. To confirm the efficiency of the graph modeling, a flexible RAG pipeline is developed using robust components. Experimental results on four benchmark test sets confirm the contribution of the layout-aware modeling for performance improvement of the RAG pipeline.</p></details> | <details><summary>NAACL...</summary><p>NAACL 2025, Industry Track</p></details> |

Recent RAG advancements focus on improving retrieval outcomes through iterative LLM refinement or self-critique capabilities acquired through additional instruction tuning of LLMs. In this work, we introduce Speculative RAG - a framework that leverages a larger generalist LM to efficiently verify multiple RAG drafts produced in parallel by a smaller, distilled specialist LM. Each draft is generated from a distinct subset of retrieved documents, offering diverse perspectives on the evidence while reducing input token counts per draft. This approach enhances comprehension of each subset and mitigates potential position bias over long context. Our method accelerates RAG by delegating drafting to the smaller specialist LM, with the larger generalist LM performing a single verification pass over the drafts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Speculative RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance with reduced latency on TriviaQA, MuSiQue, PopQA, PubHealth, and ARC-Challenge benchmarks. It notably enhances accuracy by up to 12.97% while reducing latency by 50.83% compared to conventional RAG systems on PubHealth.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Biomedical code mapping identifies similarity or equivalence between concepts from different ontologies. Obtaining high-quality mapping usually relies on automatic generation of unrefined mapping with ontology domain fine-tuned language models (LMs), followed by manual selections or corrections by coding experts who have extensive domain expertise and familiarity with ontology schemas. The LMs usually provide unrefined code mapping suggestions as a list of candidates without reasoning or supporting evidence, hence coding experts still need to verify each suggested candidate against ontology sources to pick the best matches. This is also a recurring task as ontology sources are updated regularly to incorporate new research findings. Consequently, the need of regular LM retraining and manual refinement make code mapping time-consuming and labour intensive. In this work, we created OntologyRAG, an ontology-enhanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method that leverages the inductive biases from ontological knowledge graphs for in-context-learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs). Our solution grounds LLMs to knowledge graphs with unrefined mappings between ontologies and processes questions by generating an interpretable set of results that include prediction rational with mapping proximity assessment. Our solution doesn't require re-training LMs, as all ontology updates could be reflected by updating the knowledge graphs with a standard process. Evaluation results on a self-curated gold dataset show promises of using our method to enable coding experts to achieve better and faster code mapping.

This includes the LLM, embedding, and ranker models themselves, as well as hyperparameters governing individual RAG components. Yet, collectively optimizing the entire configuration in a RAG or LLM system remains under-explored - especially in multi-objective settings - due to intractably large solution spaces, noisy objective evaluations, and the high cost of evaluations. In this work, we introduce the first approach for multi-objective parameter optimization of cost, latency, safety and alignment over entire LLM and RAG systems. We find that Bayesian optimization methods significantly outperform baseline approaches, obtaining a superior Pareto front on two new RAG benchmark tasks. We conclude our work with important considerations for practitioners who are designing multi-objective RAG systems, highlighting nuances such as how optimal configurations may not generalize across tasks and objectives.</p></details> |  |

The challenge of detecting such unauthorized usage remains underexplored, with datasets and methods from adjacent fields being ill-suited for its study. We take several steps to bridge this gap. First, we formalize this problem as (black-box) RAG Dataset Inference (RAG-DI). We then introduce a novel dataset designed for realistic benchmarking of RAG-DI methods, alongside a set of baselines. Finally, we propose Ward, a method for RAG-DI based on LLM watermarks that equips data owners with rigorous statistical guarantees regarding their dataset's misuse in RAG corpora. Ward consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving higher accuracy, superior query efficiency and robustness. Our work provides a foundation for future studies of RAG-DI and highlights LLM watermarks as a promising approach to this problem.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Yet, most existing work in RAG has underemphasized fair ranking techniques and neglected the diverse interests of all stakeholders. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of RAG systems that incorporate fairness-aware rankings, focusing on both ranking fairness and attribution fairness - ensuring equitable exposure of sources cited in the final text. We specifically examine item-side fairness, i.e., whether retrieved documents receive balanced exposure, and assess how this affects both the system's overall performance and the eventual distribution of cited sources. Across twelve RAG models and seven tasks, we find that fairness-aware retrieval frequently retains or even improves ranking effectiveness and generation quality, countering the widespread belief that fairness compromises system performance. Moreover, we show that fair retrieval leads to more balanced attribution in the final responses, ensuring that the cited sources are credited more equitably. Our results underscore the importance of item-side fairness throughout both retrieval and generation phases, offering key insights for building more responsible and equitable RAG systems and illustrating promising avenues for future exploration in fair ranking and source attribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Top 5...</summary><p>Top 5 Spotlight at AFME Workshop at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating the Effectiveness and Efficiency of Demonstration Retrievers in RAG for Coding Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09662v2)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge bases, achieving state-of-the-art results in various coding tasks. The core of RAG is retrieving demonstration examples, which is essential to balance effectiveness (generation quality) and efficiency (retrieval time) for optimal performance. However, the high-dimensional nature of code representations and large knowledge bases often create efficiency bottlenecks, which are overlooked in previous research. This paper systematically evaluates the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off of retrievers across three coding tasks: Program Synthesis, Commit Message Generation, and Assertion Generation. We examined six retrievers: two sparse (BM25 and BM25L) and four dense retrievers, including one exhaustive dense retriever (SBERT's Semantic Search) and three approximate dense retrievers (ANNOY, LSH, and HNSW). Our findings show that while BM25 excels in effectiveness, it suffers in efficiency as the knowledge base grows beyond 1000 entries. In large-scale retrieval, efficiency differences become more pronounced, with approximate dense retrievers offering the greatest gains. For instance, in Commit Generation task, HNSW achieves a 44x speed up, while only with a 1.74% drop in RougeL compared with BM25. Our results also show that increasing the number of demonstrations in the prompt doesn't always improve the effectiveness and can increase latency and lead to incorrect outputs. Our findings provide valuable insights for practitioners aiming to build efficient and effective RAG systems for coding tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables, accepted by SANER 2025</p></details> |
| **[Mitigating Bias in RAG: Controlling the Embedder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17390v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems, each individual component -- the LLM, embedder, and corpus -- could introduce biases in the form of skews towards outputting certain perspectives or identities. In this work, we study the conflict between biases of each component and their relationship to the overall bias of the RAG system, which we call bias conflict. Examining both gender and political biases as case studies, we show that bias conflict can be characterized through a linear relationship among components despite its complexity in 6 different LLMs. Through comprehensive fine-tuning experiments creating 120 differently biased embedders, we demonstrate how to control bias while maintaining utility and reveal the importance of reverse-biasing the embedder to mitigate bias in the overall system. Additionally, we find that LLMs and tasks exhibit varying sensitivities to the embedder bias, a crucial factor to consider for debiasing. Our results underscore that a fair RAG system can be better achieved by carefully controlling the bias of the embedder rather than increasing its fairness.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages (8 main), 12 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[LettuceDetect: A Hallucination Detection Framework for RAG Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17125v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems remain vulnerable to hallucinated answers despite incorporating external knowledge sources. We present LettuceDetect a framework that addresses two critical limitations in existing hallucination detection methods: (1) the context window constraints of traditional encoder-based methods, and (2) the computational inefficiency of LLM based approaches. Building on ModernBERT's extended context capabilities (up to 8k tokens) and trained on the RAGTruth benchmark dataset, our approach outperforms all previous encoder-based models and most prompt-based models, while being approximately 30 times smaller than the best models. LettuceDetect is a token-classification model that processes context-question-answer triples, allowing for the identification of unsupported claims at the token level. Evaluations on the RAGTruth corpus demonstrate an F1 score of 79.22% for example-level detection, which is a 14.8% improvement over Luna, the previous state-of-the-art encoder-based architecture. Additionally, the system can process 30 to 60 examples per second on a single GPU, making it more practical for real-world RAG applications.</p></details> | 6 pages |
| **[Don't Do RAG: When Cache-Augmented Generation is All You Need for Knowledge Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15605v2)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has gained traction as a powerful approach for enhancing language models by integrating external knowledge sources. However, RAG introduces challenges such as retrieval latency, potential errors in document selection, and increased system complexity. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) featuring significantly extended context windows, this paper proposes an alternative paradigm, cache-augmented generation (CAG) that bypasses real-time retrieval. Our method involves preloading all relevant resources, especially when the documents or knowledge for retrieval are of a limited and manageable size, into the LLM's extended context and caching its runtime parameters. During inference, the model utilizes these preloaded parameters to answer queries without additional retrieval steps. Comparative analyses reveal that CAG eliminates retrieval latency and minimizes retrieval errors while maintaining context relevance. Performance evaluations across multiple benchmarks highlight scenarios where long-context LLMs either outperform or complement traditional RAG pipelines. These findings suggest that, for certain applications, particularly those with a constrained knowledge base, CAG provide a streamlined and efficient alternative to RAG, achieving comparable or superior results with reduced complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, accepted by the Web Conference 2025 (WWW '25) as a short paper</p></details> |
| **[Worse than Zero-shot? A Fact-Checking Dataset for Evaluating the Robustness of RAG Against Misleading Retrievals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16101v1)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has shown impressive capabilities in mitigating hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs struggle to handle misleading retrievals and often fail to maintain their own reasoning when exposed to conflicting or selectively-framed evidence, making them vulnerable to real-world misinformation. In such real-world retrieval scenarios, misleading and conflicting information is rampant, particularly in the political domain, where evidence is often selectively framed, incomplete, or polarized. However, existing RAG benchmarks largely assume a clean retrieval setting, where models succeed by accurately retrieving and generating answers from gold-standard documents. This assumption fails to align with real-world conditions, leading to an overestimation of RAG system performance. To bridge this gap, we introduce RAGuard, a fact-checking dataset designed to evaluate the robustness of RAG systems against misleading retrievals. Unlike prior benchmarks that rely on synthetic noise, our dataset constructs its retrieval corpus from Reddit discussions, capturing naturally occurring misinformation. It categorizes retrieved evidence into three types: supporting, misleading, and irrelevant, providing a realistic and challenging testbed for assessing how well RAG systems navigate different retrieval information. Our benchmark experiments reveal that when exposed to misleading retrievals, all tested LLM-powered RAG systems perform worse than their zero-shot baselines (i.e., no retrieval at all), highlighting their susceptibility to noisy environments. To the best of our knowledge, RAGuard is the first benchmark to systematically assess RAG robustness against misleading evidence. We expect this benchmark will drive future research toward improving RAG systems beyond idealized datasets, making them more reliable for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Documents to Dialogue: Building KG-RAG Enhanced AI Assistants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15237v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Adobe Experience Platform AI Assistant is a conversational tool that enables organizations to interact seamlessly with proprietary enterprise data through a chatbot. However, due to access restrictions, Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot retrieve these internal documents, limiting their ability to generate accurate zero-shot responses. To overcome this limitation, we use a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework powered by a Knowledge Graph (KG) to retrieve relevant information from external knowledge sources, enabling LLMs to answer questions over private or previously unseen document collections. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for building a high-quality, low-noise KG. We apply several techniques, including incremental entity resolution using seed concepts, similarity-based filtering to deduplicate entries, assigning confidence scores to entity-relation pairs to filter for high-confidence pairs, and linking facts to source documents for provenance. Our KG-RAG system retrieves relevant tuples, which are added to the user prompts context before being sent to the LLM generating the response. Our evaluation demonstrates that this approach significantly enhances response relevance, reducing irrelevant answers by over 50% and increasing fully relevant answers by 88% compared to the existing production system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain-of-Rank: Enhancing Large Language Models for Domain-Specific RAG in Edge Device](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15134v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) is especially valuable in specialized domains, where precision is critical. To more specialize the LLMs into a target domain, domain-specific RAG has recently been developed by allowing the LLM to access the target domain early via finetuning. The domain-specific RAG makes more sense in resource-constrained environments like edge devices, as they should perform a specific task (e.g. personalization) reliably using only small-scale LLMs. While the domain-specific RAG is well-aligned with edge devices in this respect, it often relies on widely-used reasoning techniques like chain-of-thought (CoT). The reasoning step is useful to understand the given external knowledge, and yet it is computationally expensive and difficult for small-scale LLMs to learn it. Tackling this, we propose the Chain of Rank (CoR) which shifts the focus from intricate lengthy reasoning to simple ranking of the reliability of input external documents. Then, CoR reduces computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy, making it particularly suited for resource-constrained environments. We attain the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in benchmarks, and analyze its efficacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>NAACL...</summary><p>NAACL 2025 (Findings)</p></details> |
