| **[Semantic Chunking and the Entropy of Natural Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13194v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The entropy rate of printed English is famously estimated to be about one bit per character, a benchmark that modern large language models (LLMs) have only recently approached. This entropy rate implies that English contains nearly 80 percent redundancy relative to the five bits per character expected for random text. We introduce a statistical model that attempts to capture the intricate multi-scale structure of natural language, providing a first-principles account of this redundancy level. Our model describes a procedure of self-similarly segmenting text into semantically coherent chunks down to the single-word level. The semantic structure of the text can then be hierarchically decomposed, allowing for analytical treatment. Numerical experiments with modern LLMs and open datasets suggest that our model quantitatively captures the structure of real texts at different levels of the semantic hierarchy. The entropy rate predicted by our model agrees with the estimated entropy rate of printed English. Moreover, our theory further reveals that the entropy rate of natural language is not fixed but should increase systematically with the semantic complexity of corpora, which are captured by the only free parameter in our model.</p></details> | 29 pages, 9 figures |
| **[R-Zero: Self-Evolving Reasoning LLM from Zero Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05004v4)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-evolving Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a scalable path toward super-intelligence by autonomously generating, refining, and learning from their own experiences. However, existing methods for training such models still rely heavily on vast human-curated tasks and labels, typically via fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, which poses a fundamental bottleneck to advancing AI systems toward capabilities beyond human intelligence. To overcome this limitation, we introduce R-Zero, a fully autonomous framework that generates its own training data from scratch. Starting from a single base LLM, R-Zero initializes two independent models with distinct roles, a Challenger and a Solver. These models are optimized separately and co-evolve through interaction: the Challenger is rewarded for proposing tasks near the edge of the Solver capability, and the Solver is rewarded for solving increasingly challenging tasks posed by the Challenger. This process yields a targeted, self-improving curriculum without any pre-existing tasks and labels. Empirically, R-Zero substantially improves reasoning capability across different backbone LLMs, e.g., boosting the Qwen3-4B-Base by +6.49 on math-reasoning benchmarks and +7.54 on general-domain reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[tLoRA: Efficient Multi-LoRA Training with Elastic Shared Super-Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07263v2)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) becomes the standard approach for efficiently fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), shared clusters increasingly execute many concurrent LoRA training jobs over the same frozen backbone. While recent advances enable batching (co-locating) multiple adapters during serving, efficient training-time co-location of heterogeneous LoRA adapters presents unique challenges. Jobs often differ in adapter rank, batch size, and resource allocation, and naïve batching can introduce synchronization stalls, communication overheads, and per-job slowdowns that are worse than executing independently. We introduce tLoRA, a framework that enables efficient batch training of multiple LoRA jobs. tLoRA fuses adapters that share the same base model into an elastic shared super-model, exploiting existing distributed training frameworks to derive parallelism plans that share resources effectively. At the kernel level, tLoRA employs a fused LoRA kernel that adaptively reconstructs low-rank computation tiles and schedules rank-aware nano-batches to maximize overlap between computation and communication across adapters. At the scheduling layer, tLoRA incorporates an online, residual-capacity-aware scheduler that adaptively groups jobs to maximize collective throughput. Evaluations using real-world cluster traces demonstrate that tLoRA improves training throughput by 1.2--1.8x, job training completion time by 2.3--5.4x, and GPU utilization by 37%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Asynchronous Verified Semantic Caching for Tiered LLM Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13165v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) now sit in the critical path of search, assistance, and agentic workflows, making semantic caching essential for reducing inference cost and latency. Production deployments typically use a tiered static-dynamic design: a static cache of curated, offline vetted responses mined from logs, backed by a dynamic cache populated online. In practice, both tiers are commonly governed by a single embedding similarity threshold, which induces a hard tradeoff: conservative thresholds miss safe reuse opportunities, while aggressive thresholds risk serving semantically incorrect responses. We introduce \textbf{Krites}, an asynchronous, LLM-judged caching policy that expands static coverage without changing serving decisions. On the critical path, Krites behaves exactly like a standard static threshold policy. When the nearest static neighbor of the prompt falls just below the static threshold, Krites asynchronously invokes an LLM judge to verify whether the static response is acceptable for the new prompt. Approved matches are promoted into the dynamic cache, allowing future repeats and paraphrases to reuse curated static answers and expanding static reach over time. In trace-driven simulations on conversational and search workloads, Krites increases the fraction of requests served with curated static answers (direct static hits plus verified promotions) by up to $\textbf{3.9}$ times for conversational traffic and search-style queries relative to tuned baselines, with unchanged critical path latency.</p></details> |  |
| **[In-Context Autonomous Network Incident Response: An End-to-End Large Language Model Agent Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13156v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapidly evolving cyberattacks demand incident response systems that can autonomously learn and adapt to changing threats. Prior work has extensively explored the reinforcement learning approach, which involves learning response strategies through extensive simulation of the incident. While this approach can be effective, it requires handcrafted modeling of the simulator and suppresses useful semantics from raw system logs and alerts. To address these limitations, we propose to leverage large language models' (LLM) pre-trained security knowledge and in-context learning to create an end-to-end agentic solution for incident response planning. Specifically, our agent integrates four functionalities, perception, reasoning, planning, and action, into one lightweight LLM (14b model). Through fine-tuning and chain-of-thought reasoning, our LLM agent is capable of processing system logs and inferring the underlying network state (perception), updating its conjecture of attack models (reasoning), simulating consequences under different response strategies (planning), and generating an effective response (action). By comparing LLM-simulated outcomes with actual observations, the LLM agent repeatedly refines its attack conjecture and corresponding response, thereby demonstrating in-context adaptation. Our agentic approach is free of modeling and can run on commodity hardware. When evaluated on incident logs reported in the literature, our agent achieves recovery up to 23% faster than those of frontier LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>2026 ...</summary><p>2026 AAAI Summer Symposium on Human-Aware AI Agents for the Cyber Battlefield</p></details> |
| **[Peaceful Anarcho-Accelerationism: Decentralized Full Automation for a Society of Universal Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13154v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The convergence of large language models that automate cognitive labor and deep reinforcement learning agents that automate physical labor implies the near-complete elimination of human employment. The universal approximation theorem and foundational DRL results establish that all labor is in principle automatable. The critical question is not whether full automation will arrive, but who will control it. This paper introduces peaceful anarcho-accelerationism: a sociotechnical framework ensuring that full automation is decentralized, commons-governed, and oriented toward universal care. We propose the Liberation Stack, a layered architecture of energy, manufacturing, food, communication, knowledge, and governance commons built on open-source technologies. We show that this framework builds bridges with liberalism, socialism, environmentalism, feminism, cooperativism, and the hacker ethic. Empirical evidence from Linux, Wikipedia, Mondragon, Rojava, and guifi.net confirms that commons-based systems already operate at scale. We argue that full automation renders money obsolete and propose Universal Desired Resources (UDR), a post-monetary design principle where every person requests what they need from the robotic commons, constrained only by ecological sustainability. Drawing on the independence of phenomenal consciousness from computational intelligence, we establish that delegating labor to non-conscious machines is care at civilizational scale, and that moral policy can be studied through deep reinforcement learning. We conclude with a phased roadmap toward the care-centered society, including milestones, assumptions, and limitations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantization-Robust LLM Unlearning via Low-Rank Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13151v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) unlearning aims to remove targeted knowledge from a trained model, but practical deployments often require post-training quantization (PTQ) for efficient inference. However, aggressive low-bit PTQ can mask or erase unlearning updates, causing quantized models to revert to pre-unlearning behavior. We show that standard full-parameter fine-tuning often induce parameter changes that are too small to survive 4-bit quantization. We propose quantization-robust unlearning via low-rank adaptation (LoRA): we freeze the base model and concentrate unlearning into trainable adapters so that the effective update is preserved after quantization. On Llama-2-7B evaluated with MUSE dataset (BOOKS and NEWS), LoRA improves 4-bit utility by up to 7.93 points (NPO+GDR on BOOKS: 50.17 to 58.10) and yields higher 4-bit utility on NEWS for GA+GDR (40.06 to 44.82, increase of 4.76). LoRA also substantially reduces privacy leakage under 4-bit PTQ, e.g., for GA+KLR on BOOKS, PrivLeak moves from -25.68 to -5.86 (closer to ideal 0), while maintaining strong forgetting (VerMem and KnowMem near 0). Thus, using LoRA for Machine Unlearning is beneficial for scenarios where quantization is necessary for model deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Highlight & Summarize: RAG without the jailbreaks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02872v2)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preventing jailbreaking and model hijacking of Large Language Models (LLMs) is an important yet challenging task. When interacting with a chatbot, malicious users can input specially crafted prompts that cause the LLM to generate undesirable content or perform a different task from its intended purpose. Existing systems attempt to mitigate this by hardening the LLM's system prompt or using additional classifiers to detect undesirable content or off-topic conversations. However, these probabilistic approaches are relatively easy to bypass due to the very large space of possible inputs and undesirable outputs. We present and evaluate Highlight & Summarize (H&S), a new design pattern for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that prevents these attacks by design. The core idea is to perform the same task as a standard RAG pipeline (i.e., to provide natural language answers to questions, based on relevant sources) without ever revealing the user's question to the generative LLM. This is achieved by splitting the pipeline into two components: a highlighter, which takes the user's question and extracts ("highlights") relevant passages from the retrieved documents, and a summarizer, which takes the highlighted passages and summarizes them into a cohesive answer. We describe and implement several possible instantiations of H&S and evaluate their responses in terms of correctness, relevance, and quality. For certain question-answering (QA) tasks, the responses produced by H&S are judged to be as good, if not better, than those of a standard RAG pipeline.</p></details> |  |
| **[SCOPE: Selective Conformal Optimized Pairwise LLM Judging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13110v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as judges to replace costly human preference labels in pairwise evaluation. Despite their practicality, LLM judges remain prone to miscalibration and systematic biases. This paper proposes SCOPE (Selective Conformal Optimized Pairwise Evaluation), a framework for selective pairwise judging with finite-sample statistical guarantees. Under exchangeability, SCOPE calibrates an acceptance threshold such that the error rate among non-abstained judgments is at most a user-specified level $α$. To provide SCOPE with a bias-neutral uncertainty signal, we introduce Bidirectional Preference Entropy (BPE), which queries the judge under both response positions, aggregates the implied preference probabilities to enforce invariance to response order, and converts the aggregated probability into an entropy-based uncertainty score. Across MT-Bench, RewardBench, and Chatbot Arena, BPE improves uncertainty quality over standard confidence proxies, providing a stronger selection signal that enables SCOPE to consistently meet the target risk level while retaining good coverage across judge scales. In particular, at $α= 0.10$, \textsc{Scope} consistently satisfies the risk bound across all benchmarks and judge scales (empirical risk $\approx 0.097$ to $0.099$), while retaining substantial coverage, reaching $0.89$ on RewardBench with Qwen-14B and $0.98$ on RewardBench with Qwen-32B. Compared to naïve baselines, \textsc{Scope} accepts up to $2.4\times$ more judgments on MT-Bench with Qwen-7B under the same target risk constraint, demonstrating that BPE enables reliable and high-coverage LLM-based evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic Caching for Low-Cost LLM Serving: From Offline Learning to Online Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07675v3)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing how users interact with information systems, yet their high inference cost poses serious scalability and sustainability challenges. Caching inference responses, allowing them to be retrieved without another forward pass through the LLM, has emerged as one possible solution. Traditional exact-match caching, however, overlooks the semantic similarity between queries, leading to unnecessary recomputation. Semantic caching addresses this by retrieving responses based on semantic similarity, but introduces a fundamentally different cache eviction problem: one must account for mismatch costs between incoming queries and cached responses. Moreover, key system parameters, such as query arrival probabilities and serving costs, are often unknown and must be learned over time. Existing semantic caching methods are largely ad-hoc, lacking theoretical foundations and unable to adapt to real-world uncertainty. In this paper, we present a principled, learning-based framework for semantic cache eviction under unknown query and cost distributions. We formulate both offline optimization and online learning variants of the problem, and develop provably efficient algorithms with state-of-the-art guarantees. We also evaluate our framework on a synthetic dataset, showing that our proposed algorithms perform matching or superior performance compared with baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to INFOCOM 2026</p></details> |
| **[Mathematics and Machine Creativity: A Survey on Bridging Mathematics with AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16543v4)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a comprehensive overview on the applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in mathematical research, highlighting the transformative role AI has begun to play in this domain. Traditionally, AI advancements have heavily relied on theoretical foundations provided by mathematics and statistics. However, recent developments in AI, particularly in reinforcement learning (RL) and large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated the potential for AI to contribute back to mathematics by offering flexible algorithmic frameworks and powerful inductive reasoning capabilities that support various aspects of mathematical research. This survey aims to establish a bridge between AI and mathematics, providing insights into the mutual benefits and fostering deeper interdisciplinary understanding. In particular, we argue that while current AI and LLMs may struggle with complex deductive reasoning, their "inherent creativity", the ability to generate outputs at high throughput based on recognition of shallow patterns, holds significant potential to support and inspire mathematical research. This creative capability, often overlooked, could be the key to unlocking new perspectives and methodologies in mathematics. Furthermore, we address the lack of cross-disciplinary communication: mathematicians may not fully comprehend the latest advances in AI, while AI researchers frequently prioritize benchmark performance over real-world applications in frontier mathematical research. This paper seeks to close that gap, offering a detailed exploration of AI fundamentals, its strengths, and its emerging applications in the mathematical sciences.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article is withdrawn due to internal authorship and supervisory considerations that require clarification before the work can proceed in its current form.

| **[Reasoning about Intent for Ambiguous Requests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10453v2)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models often respond to ambiguous requests by implicitly committing to one interpretation. Intent misunderstandings can frustrate users and create safety risks. To address this, we propose generating multiple interpretation-answer pairs in a single structured response to ambiguous requests. Our models are trained with reinforcement learning and customized reward functions using multiple valid answers as supervision. Experiments on conversational question answering and semantic parsing demonstrate that our method achieves higher coverage of valid answers than baseline approaches. Human evaluation confirms that predicted interpretations are highly aligned with their answers. Our approach promotes transparency with explicit interpretations, achieves efficiency by requiring only one generation step, and supports downstream applications through its structured output format.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring a New Competency Modeling Process with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13084v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Competency modeling is widely used in human resource management to select, develop, and evaluate talent. However, traditional expert-driven approaches rely heavily on manual analysis of large volumes of interview transcripts, making them costly and prone to randomness, ambiguity, and limited reproducibility. This study proposes a new competency modeling process built on large language models (LLMs). Instead of merely automating isolated steps, we reconstruct the workflow by decomposing expert practices into structured computational components. Specifically, we leverage LLMs to extract behavioral and psychological descriptions from raw textual data and map them to predefined competency libraries through embedding-based similarity. We further introduce a learnable parameter that adaptively integrates different information sources, enabling the model to determine the relative importance of behavioral and psychological signals. To address the long-standing challenge of validation, we develop an offline evaluation procedure that allows systematic model selection without requiring additional large-scale data collection. Empirical results from a real-world implementation in a software outsourcing company demonstrate strong predictive validity, cross-library consistency, and structural robustness. Overall, our framework transforms competency modeling from a largely qualitative and expert-dependent practice into a transparent, data-driven, and evaluable analytical process.</p></details> |  |
| **[LCSB: Layer-Cyclic Selective Backpropagation for Memory-Efficient On-Device LLM Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13073v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Memory-efficient backpropagation (MeBP) has enabled first-order fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) on mobile devices with less than 1GB memory. However, MeBP requires backward computation through all transformer layers at every step, where weight decompression alone accounts for 32--42% of backward time. We propose Layer-Cyclic Selective Backpropagation (LCSB), which computes gradients for only a subset of layers per step. Our key insight is that residual connections guarantee gradient flow through identity paths, while AdamW momentum provides implicit updates for non-selected layers. We interpret LCSB as Block Coordinate Descent on the LoRA parameter space, providing theoretical justification for convergence. LCSB achieves up to 1.40$\times$ speedup with less than 2\% quality degradation across five models and three tasks. Surprisingly, in 4-bit quantized settings, LCSB exhibits superior stability: a 3B model that completely diverges under full backpropagation converges smoothly with LCSB, suggesting an implicit regularization effect from selective gradient computation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under the review, 13 pages</p></details> |
| **[Memory-Efficient Structured Backpropagation for On-Device LLM Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13069v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>On-device fine-tuning enables privacy-preserving personalization of large language models, but mobile devices impose severe memory constraints, typically 6--12GB shared across all workloads. Existing approaches force a trade-off between exact gradients with high memory (MeBP) and low memory with noisy estimates (MeZO). We propose Memory-efficient Structured Backpropagation (MeSP), which bridges this gap by manually deriving backward passes that exploit LoRA's low-rank structure. Our key insight is that the intermediate projection $h = xA$ can be recomputed during backward at minimal cost since rank $r \ll d_{in}$, eliminating the need to store it. MeSP achieves 49\% average memory reduction compared to MeBP on Qwen2.5 models (0.5B--3B) while computing mathematically identical gradients. Our analysis also reveals that MeZO's gradient estimates show near-zero correlation with true gradients (cosine similarity $\approx$0.001), explaining its slow convergence. MeSP reduces peak memory from 361MB to 136MB for Qwen2.5-0.5B, enabling fine-tuning scenarios previously infeasible on memory-constrained devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under the review, 11 pages</p></details> |
| **[LTSM-Bundle: A Toolbox and Benchmark on Large Language Models for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14045v3)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Forecasting (TSF) has long been a challenge in time series analysis. Inspired by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers are now developing Large Time Series Models (LTSMs)-universal transformer-based models that use autoregressive prediction-to improve TSF. However, training LTSMs on heterogeneous time series data poses unique challenges, including diverse frequencies, dimensions, and patterns across datasets. Recent endeavors have studied and evaluated various design choices aimed at enhancing LTSM training and generalization capabilities. However, these design choices are typically studied and evaluated in isolation and are not benchmarked collectively. In this work, we introduce LTSM-Bundle, a comprehensive toolbox, and benchmark for training LTSMs, spanning pre-processing techniques, model configurations, and dataset configuration. It modularized and benchmarked LTSMs from multiple dimensions, encompassing prompting strategies, tokenization approaches, training paradigms, base model selection, data quantity, and dataset diversity. Furthermore, we combine the most effective design choices identified in our study. Empirical results demonstrate that this combination achieves superior zero-shot and few-shot performances compared to state-of-the-art LTSMs and traditional TSF methods on benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Difficulty-Aware Agentic Orchestration for Query-Specific Multi-Agent Workflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11079v5)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems have shown strong capabilities across various tasks. However, existing multi-agent frameworks often rely on static or task-level workflows, which either over-process simple queries or underperform on complex ones, while also neglecting the efficiency-performance trade-offs across heterogeneous LLMs. To address these limitations, we propose Difficulty-Aware Agentic Orchestration (DAAO), which can dynamically generate query-specific multi-agent workflows guided by predicted query difficulty. DAAO comprises three interdependent modules: a variational autoencoder (VAE) for difficulty estimation, a modular operator allocator, and a cost- and performance-aware LLM router. A self-adjusting policy updates difficulty estimates based on workflow success, enabling simpler workflows for easy queries and more complex strategies for harder ones. Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that DAAO surpasses prior multi-agent systems in both accuracy and inference efficiency, validating its effectiveness for adaptive, difficulty-aware reasoning.</p></details> | Accepted to WWW2026 |

However, the unprecedented scale and heterogeneity of these datasets demand robust frameworks for data integration and annotation. The Cell Ontology (CL) has emerged as a pivotal resource for achieving FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles by providing standardized, species-agnostic terms for canonical cell types - forming a core component of a wide range of platforms and tools. In this paper, we describe the wide variety of uses of CL in these platforms and tools and detail ongoing work to improve and extend CL content including the addition of transcriptomic types, working closely with major atlasing efforts including the Human Cell Atlas and the Brain Initiative Cell Atlas Network to support their needs. We cover the challenges and future plans for harmonising classical and transcriptomic cell type definitions, integrating markers and using Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve content and efficiency of CL workflows.</p></details> | 48 pages, 8 Figures |

This shift raises significant concerns, including the undermining of skill evaluations, the mass-production of low-quality content, and the proliferation of misinformation. Addressing these issues, we introduce GPTZero a state-of-the-art industrial AI detection solution, offering reliable discernment between human and LLM-generated text. Our key contributions include: introducing a hierarchical, multi-task architecture enabling a flexible taxonomy of human and AI texts, demonstrating state-of-the-art accuracy on a variety of domains with granular predictions, and achieving superior robustness to adversarial attacks and paraphrasing via multi-tiered automated red teaming. GPTZero offers accurate and explainable detection, and educates users on its responsible use, ensuring fair and transparent assessment of text.</p></details> |  |

Sampling temperature directly controls the exploration--exploitation trade-off by modulating policy entropy, yet existing methods rely on static values or heuristic adaptations that are decoupled from task-level rewards. We propose Introspective LLM, a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that learns to control sampling temperature during generation. At each decoding step, the model selects a temperature based on its hidden state and samples the next token from the resulting distribution. Temperature and token policies are jointly optimized from downstream rewards using a coordinate ascent scheme. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that learned temperature policies outperform fixed and heuristic baselines, while exhibiting interpretable exploration behaviors aligned with reasoning uncertainty.</p></details> |  |

When expanding AI access, governments face a set of strategic choices over whether to buy existing services, build domestic capabilities, or adopt hybrid approaches across different domains and use cases. These are critical decisions especially when leading model providers are often foreign corporations, and LLM outputs are increasingly treated as trusted inputs to public decision-making and public discourse. In practice, these decisions are not intended to mandate a single approach across all domains; instead, national AI strategies are typically pluralistic, with sovereign, commercial and open-source models coexisting to serve different purposes. Governments may rely on commercial models for non-sensitive or commodity tasks, while pursuing greater control for critical, high-risk or strategically important applications. This paper provides a strategic framework for making this decision by evaluating these options across dimensions including sovereignty, safety, cost, resource capability, cultural fit, and sustainability. Importantly, "building" does not imply that governments must act alone: domestic capabilities may be developed through public research institutions, universities, state-owned enterprises, joint ventures, or broader national ecosystems. By detailing the technical requirements and practical challenges of each pathway, this work aims to serve as a reference for policy-makers to determine whether a buy or build approach best aligns with their specific national needs and societal goals.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The short version of this document is published as an ACM TechBrief, and this document is published as an ACM Technology Policy Council white paper</p></details> |

Yet many LLM-based approaches ignore interactions among rules, and the opportunity to couple LLMs with probabilistic rule learning for robust inference remains underexplored. We present RLIE, a unified framework that integrates LLMs with probabilistic modeling to learn a set of weighted rules. RLIE has four stages: (1) Rule generation, where an LLM proposes and filters candidates; (2) Logistic regression, which learns probabilistic weights for global selection and calibration; (3) Iterative refinement, which updates the rule set using prediction errors; and (4) Evaluation, which compares the weighted rule set as a direct classifier with methods that inject rules into an LLM. We evaluate multiple inference strategies on real-world datasets. Applying rules directly with their learned weights yields superior performance, whereas prompting LLMs with the rules, weights, and logistic-model outputs surprisingly degrades accuracy. This supports the view that LLMs excel at semantic generation and interpretation but are less reliable for precise probabilistic integration. RLIE clarifies the potential and limitations of LLMs for inductive reasoning and couples them with classic probabilistic rule combination methods to enable more reliable neuro-symbolic reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-Aligned MLLM Judges for Fine-Grained Image Editing Evaluation: A Benchmark, Framework, and Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13028v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating image editing models remains challenging due to the coarse granularity and limited interpretability of traditional metrics, which often fail to capture aspects important to human perception and intent. Such metrics frequently reward visually plausible outputs while overlooking controllability, edit localization, and faithfulness to user instructions. In this work, we introduce a fine-grained Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-as-a-Judge framework for image editing that decomposes common evaluation notions into twelve fine-grained interpretable factors spanning image preservation, edit quality, and instruction fidelity. Building on this formulation, we present a new human-validated benchmark that integrates human judgments, MLLM-based evaluations, model outputs, and traditional metrics across diverse image editing tasks. Through extensive human studies, we show that the proposed MLLM judges align closely with human evaluations at a fine granularity, supporting their use as reliable and scalable evaluators. We further demonstrate that traditional image editing metrics are often poor proxies for these factors, failing to distinguish over-edited or semantically imprecise outputs, whereas our judges provide more intuitive and informative assessments in both offline and online settings. Together, this work introduces a benchmark, a principled factorization, and empirical evidence positioning fine-grained MLLM judges as a practical foundation for studying, comparing, and improving image editing approaches.</p></details> |  |

We present Bielik Guard, a family of compact Polish language safety classifiers comprising two model variants: a 0.1B parameter model based on MMLW-RoBERTa-base and a 0.5B parameter model based on PKOBP/polish-roberta-8k. Fine-tuned on a community-annotated dataset of 6,885 Polish texts, these models classify content across five safety categories: Hate/Aggression, Vulgarities, Sexual Content, Crime, and Self-Harm. Our evaluation demonstrates that both models achieve strong performance on multiple benchmarks. The 0.5B variant offers the best overall discrimination capability with F1 scores of 0.791 (micro) and 0.785 (macro) on the test set, while the 0.1B variant demonstrates exceptional efficiency. Notably, Bielik Guard 0.1B v1.1 achieves superior precision (77.65%) and very low false positive rate (0.63%) on real user prompts, outperforming HerBERT-PL-Guard (31.55% precision, 4.70% FPR) despite identical model size. The models are publicly available and designed to provide appropriate responses rather than simple content blocking, particularly for sensitive categories like self-harm.</p></details> |  |

Their ability to autonomously execute tasks across web, software, and physical environments creates new and amplified security risks, distinct from both traditional AI safety and conventional software security. This survey outlines a taxonomy of threats specific to agentic AI, reviews recent benchmarks and evaluation methodologies, and discusses defense strategies from both technical and governance perspectives. We synthesize current research and highlight open challenges, aiming to support the development of secure-by-design agent systems.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods typically operate on the simplistic premise that model performance equates with internal knowledge, overlooking the knowledge-confidence gaps that lead to overconfident errors or uncertain truths. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel meta-cognitive framework for reliable knowledge augmentation via differentiated intervention and alignment. Our approach leverages internal cognitive signals to partition the knowledge space into mastered, confused, and missing regions, guiding targeted knowledge expansion. Furthermore, we introduce a cognitive consistency mechanism to synchronize subjective certainty with objective accuracy, ensuring calibrated knowledge boundaries. Extensive experiments demonstrate the our framework consistently outperforms strong baselines, validating its rationality in not only enhancing knowledge capabilities but also fostering cognitive behaviors that better distinguish knowns from unknowns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stratified Sampling for Model-Assisted Estimation with Surrogate Outcomes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12992v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many randomized trials, outcomes such as essays or open-ended responses must be manually scored as a preliminary step to impact analysis, a process that is costly and limiting. Model-assisted estimation offers a way to combine surrogate outcomes generated by machine learning or large language models with a human-coded subset, yet typical implementations use simple random sampling and therefore overlook systematic variation in surrogate prediction error. We extend this framework by incorporating stratified sampling to more efficiently allocate human coding effort. We derive the exact variance of the stratified model-assisted estimator, characterize conditions under which stratification improves precision, and identify a Neyman-type optimal allocation rule that oversamples strata with larger residual variance. We evaluate our methods through a comprehensive simulation study to assess finite-sample performance. Overall, we find stratification consistently improves efficiency when surrogate prediction errors exhibit structured bias or heteroskedasticity. We also present two empirical applications, one using data from an education RCT and one using a large observational corpus, to illustrate how these methods can be implemented in practice using ChatGPT-generated surrogate outcomes. Overall, this framework provides a practical design-based approach for leveraging surrogate outcomes and strategically allocating human coding effort to obtain unbiased estimates with greater efficiency. While motivated by text-as-data applications, the methodology applies broadly to any setting where outcome measurement is costly or prohibitive, and can be applied to comparisons across groups or estimating the mean of a single group.</p></details> |  |
| **[INHerit-SG: Incremental Hierarchical Semantic Scene Graphs with RAG-Style Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12971v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Driven by advancements in foundation models, semantic scene graphs have emerged as a prominent paradigm for high-level 3D environmental abstraction in robot navigation. However, existing approaches are fundamentally misaligned with the needs of embodied tasks. As they rely on either offline batch processing or implicit feature embeddings, the maps can hardly support interpretable human-intent reasoning in complex environments. To address these limitations, we present INHerit-SG. We redefine the map as a structured, RAG-ready knowledge base where natural-language descriptions are introduced as explicit semantic anchors to better align with human intent. An asynchronous dual-process architecture, together with a Floor-Room-Area-Object hierarchy, decouples geometric segmentation from time-consuming semantic reasoning. An event-triggered map update mechanism reorganizes the graph only when meaningful semantic events occur. This strategy enables our graph to maintain long-term consistency with relatively low computational overhead. For retrieval, we deploy multi-role Large Language Models (LLMs) to decompose queries into atomic constraints and handle logical negations, and employ a hard-to-soft filtering strategy to ensure robust reasoning. This explicit interpretability improves the success rate and reliability of complex retrievals, enabling the system to adapt to a broader spectrum of human interaction tasks. We evaluate INHerit-SG on a newly constructed dataset, HM3DSem-SQR, and in real-world environments. Experiments demonstrate that our system achieves state-of-the-art performance on complex queries, and reveal its scalability for downstream navigation tasks.

| **[ProbeLLM: Automating Principled Diagnosis of LLM Failures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12966v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how and why large language models (LLMs) fail is becoming a central challenge as models rapidly evolve and static evaluations fall behind. While automated probing has been enabled by dynamic test generation, existing approaches often discover isolated failure cases, lack principled control over exploration, and provide limited insight into the underlying structure of model weaknesses. We propose ProbeLLM, a benchmark-agnostic automated probing framework that elevates weakness discovery from individual failures to structured failure modes. ProbeLLM formulates probing as a hierarchical Monte Carlo Tree Search, explicitly allocating limited probing budgets between global exploration of new failure regions and local refinement of recurring error patterns. By restricting probing to verifiable test cases and leveraging tool-augmented generation and verification, ProbeLLM grounds failure discovery in reliable evidence. Discovered failures are further consolidated into interpretable failure modes via failure-aware embeddings and boundary-aware induction. Across diverse benchmarks and LLMs, ProbeLLM reveals substantially broader, cleaner, and more fine-grained failure landscapes than static benchmarks and prior automated methods, supporting a shift from case-centric evaluation toward principled weakness discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[TriGen: NPU Architecture for End-to-End Acceleration of Large Language Models based on SW-HW Co-Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12962v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have extensively explored NPU architectures for accelerating AI inference in on-device environments, which are inherently resource-constrained. Meanwhile, transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have become dominant, with rapidly increasing model sizes but low degree of parameter reuse compared to conventional CNNs, making end-to-end execution on resource-limited devices extremely challenging. To address these challenges, we propose TriGen, a novel NPU architecture tailored for resource-constrained environments through software-hardware co-design. Firstly, TriGen adopts low-precision computation using microscaling (MX) to enable additional optimization opportunities while preserving accuracy, and resolves the issues that arise by employing such precision. Secondly, to jointly optimize both nonlinear and linear operations, TriGen eliminates the need for specialized hardware for essential nonlinear operations by using fast and accurate LUT, thereby maximizing performance gains and reducing hardware-cost in on-device environments, and finally, by taking practical hardware constraints into account, further employs scheduling techniques to maximize computational utilization even under limited on-chip memory capacity. We evaluate the performance of TriGen on various LLMs and show that TriGen achieves an average 2.73x performance speedup and 52% less memory transfer over the baseline NPU design with negligible accuracy loss.</p></details> | 13 pages, 14 figures |

Within modern e-commerce ecosystems, these reviews remain a critical governance challenge. Despite advances in review-level and graph-based detection methods, two pivotal limitations remain: inadequate generalization and lack of interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose JARVIS, a framework providing Judgment via Augmented Retrieval and eVIdence graph Structures. Starting from the review to be evaluated, it retrieves semantically similar evidence via hybrid dense-sparse multimodal retrieval, expands relational signals through shared entities, and constructs a heterogeneous evidence graph. Large language model then performs evidence-grounded adjudication to produce interpretable risk assessments. Offline experiments demonstrate that JARVIS enhances performance on our constructed review dataset, achieving a precision increase from 0.953 to 0.988 and a recall boost from 0.830 to 0.901. In the production environment, our framework achieves a 27% increase in the recall volume and reduces manual inspection time by 75%. Furthermore, the adoption rate of the model-generated analysis reaches 96.4%.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAISE: Reinforced Adaptive Instruction Selection For Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07282v5)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the instruction fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs), it is widely recognized that a few high-quality instructions are superior to a large number of low-quality instructions. At present, many instruction selection methods have been proposed, but most of these methods select instruction based on heuristic quality metrics, and only consider data selection before training. These designs lead to insufficient optimization of instruction fine-tuning, and fixed heuristic indicators are often difficult to optimize for specific tasks. Therefore, we design a dynamic, task-objective-driven instruction selection framework RAISE(Reinforced Adaptive Instruction SElection), which incorporates the entire instruction fine-tuning process into optimization, selecting instructions at each step based on the expected impact of each instruction on model performance improvement. Our approach is well interpretable and has strong task-specific optimization capabilities. By modeling dynamic instruction selection as a sequential decision-making process, we use RL to train our selection strategy. Extensive experiments and result analysis prove the superiority of our method compared with other instruction selection methods. Notably, RAISE achieves superior performance by updating only 1% of the training steps compared to full-data training, demonstrating its efficiency and effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025 findings</p></details> |
| **[Unleashing MLLMs on the Edge: A Unified Framework for Cross-Modal ReID via Adaptive SVD Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12936v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Practical cloud-edge deployment of Cross-Modal Re-identification (CM-ReID) faces challenges due to maintaining a fragmented ecosystem of specialized cloud models for diverse modalities. While Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer strong unification potential, existing approaches fail to adapt them into a single end-to-end backbone and lack effective knowledge distillation strategies for edge deployment. To address these limitations, we propose MLLMEmbed-ReID, a unified framework based on a powerful cloud-edge architecture. First, we adapt a foundational MLLM into a state-of-the-art cloud model. We leverage instruction-based prompting to guide the MLLM in generating a unified embedding space across RGB, infrared, sketch, and text modalities. This model is then trained efficiently with a hierarchical Low-Rank Adaptation finetuning (LoRA-SFT) strategy, optimized under a holistic cross-modal alignment objective. Second, to deploy its knowledge onto an edge-native student, we introduce a novel distillation strategy motivated by the low-rank property in the teacher's feature space. To prioritize essential information, this method employs a Principal Component Mapping loss, while relational structures are preserved via a Feature Relation loss. Our lightweight edge-based model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple visual CM-ReID benchmarks, while its cloud-based counterpart excels across all CM-ReID benchmarks. The MLLMEmbed-ReID framework thus presents a complete and effective solution for deploying unified MLLM-level intelligence on resource-constrained devices. The code and models will be open-sourced soon.</p></details> | <details><summary>Equal...</summary><p>Equal contribution by Jie Li</p></details> |

To address this, we introduce a new idiom dataset, a large-scale, culturally-grounded corpus of 10,361 Bengali idioms. Each idiom is annotated under a comprehensive 19-field schema, established and refined through a deliberative expert consensus process, that captures its semantic, syntactic, cultural, and religious dimensions, providing a rich, structured resource for computational linguistics. To establish a robust benchmark for Bangla figurative language understanding, we evaluate 30 state-of-the-art multilingual and instruction-tuned LLMs on the task of inferring figurative meaning. Our results reveal a critical performance gap, with no model surpassing 50% accuracy, a stark contrast to significantly higher human performance (83.4%). This underscores the limitations of existing models in cross-linguistic and cultural reasoning. By releasing the new idiom dataset and benchmark, we provide foundational infrastructure for advancing figurative language understanding and cultural grounding in LLMs for Bengali and other low-resource languages.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures.

However, the success of existing TWI methods heavily relies on the assumption that interleaved image-text CoTs are faultless, which is easily violated in real-world scenarios due to the complexity of multimodal understanding. In this paper, we reveal and study a highly-practical yet under-explored problem in TWI, termed Noisy Thinking (NT). Specifically, NT refers to the imperfect visual cues mining and answer reasoning process. As the saying goes, ``One mistake leads to another'', erroneous interleaved CoT would cause error accumulation, thus significantly degrading the performance of MLLMs. To solve the NT problem, we propose a novel method dubbed Reliable Thinking with Images (RTWI). In brief, RTWI estimates the reliability of visual cues and textual CoT in a unified text-centric manner and accordingly employs robust filtering and voting modules to prevent NT from contaminating the final answer. Extensive experiments on seven benchmarks verify the effectiveness of RTWI against NT.</p></details> | 26 pages, 19 figures |
| **[LLMs as In-Context Meta-Learners for Model and Hyperparameter Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26510v3)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model and hyperparameter selection are critical but challenging in machine learning, typically requiring expert intuition or expensive automated search. We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can act as in-context meta-learners for this task. By converting each dataset into interpretable metadata, we prompt an LLM to recommend both model families and hyperparameters. We study two prompting strategies: (1) a zero-shot mode relying solely on pretrained knowledge, and (2) a meta-informed mode augmented with examples of models and their performance on past tasks. Across synthetic and real-world benchmarks, we show that LLMs can exploit dataset metadata to recommend competitive models and hyperparameters without search, and that improvements from meta-informed prompting demonstrate their capacity for in-context meta-learning. These results highlight a promising new role for LLMs as lightweight, general-purpose assistants for model selection and hyperparameter optimization.</p></details> | 27 pages, 6 figures |

Serving as an interdisciplinary cornerstone, computational neuroscience formalizes the hierarchical and dynamic structures of language into testable neural models through modeling, simulation, and data analysis. This enables a computational dialogue between linguistic hypotheses and neural mechanisms. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly large language models (LLMs), have powerfully advanced this pursuit. Their high-dimensional representational spaces provide a novel scale for exploring the neural basis of linguistic processing, while the "model-brain alignment" framework offers a methodology to evaluate the biological plausibility of language-related theories.</p></details> |  |

From a formative study with 12 participants, we found that end-users actively seek to shape task-oriented interfaces rather than relying on one-shot outputs. To address this, we introduce the human-agent co-generation paradigm, materialized in DuetUI. This LLM-empowered system unfolds alongside task progress through a bidirectional context loop-the agent scaffolds the interface by decomposing the task, while the user's direct manipulations implicitly steer the agent's next generation step. In a technical ablation study and a user study with 24 participants, DuetUI improved task efficiency and interface usability, supporting more seamless human-agent collaboration. Our contributions include the proposal of this novel paradigm, the design of a proof-of-concept DuetUI prototype embodying it, and empirical and technical insights from an initial evaluation of how this bidirectional loop may help align agents with human intent and inform future development.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents AudioToolAgent, a framework that coordinates audio-language models as tools via a central LLM agent that accesses tool adapters for audio question answering and speech-to-text. The agent reasons about which tools to invoke, how to formulate follow-up queries, and how to arbitrate conflicting tool outputs, without accessing the audio. Experiments with MMAU, MMAR, and MMAU-Pro show state-of-the-art accuracy: up to 77.50% in MMAU, 77.00% in MMAR, and 61.90% in MMAU-Pro. Shapley-based analysis identifies effective agent-tool combinations. The code and reproduction materials are available at https://github.com/GLJS/AudioToolAgent.</p></details> |  |

However, the lack of an efficient evaluation framework impedes the diagnosis of their performance bottlenecks. Current evaluation primarily relies on testing after supervised fine-tuning, which introduces laborious additional training and autoregressive decoding costs. Meanwhile, common pre-training metrics cannot quantify a model's perception and reasoning abilities in a disentangled manner. Furthermore, existing evaluation benchmarks are typically limited in scale or misaligned with pre-training objectives. Thus, we propose RADAR, an efficient ability-centric evaluation framework for Revealing Asymmetric Development of Abilities in MLLM pRe-training. RADAR involves two key components: (1) Soft Discrimination Score, a novel metric for robustly tracking ability development without fine-tuning, based on quantifying nuanced gradations of the model preference for the correct answer over distractors; and (2) Multi-Modal Mixture Benchmark, a new 15K+ sample benchmark for comprehensively evaluating pre-trained MLLMs' perception and reasoning abilities in a 0-shot manner, where we unify authoritative benchmark datasets and carefully collect new datasets, extending the evaluation scope and addressing the critical gaps in current benchmarks. With RADAR, we comprehensively reveal the asymmetric development of perceptual and reasoning capabilities in pretrained MLLMs across diverse factors, including data volume, model size, and pretraining strategy. Our RADAR underscores the need for a decomposed perspective on pre-training ability bottlenecks, informing targeted interventions to advance MLLMs efficiently. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Nieysh/RADAR.</p></details> |  |

Detecting and Rewriting Underspecified Questions Improve QA Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11938v2)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) perform well on well-posed questions, yet standard question-answering (QA) benchmarks remain far from solved. We argue that this gap is partly due to underspecified questions - queries whose interpretation cannot be uniquely determined without additional context. To test this hypothesis, we introduce an LLM-based classifier to identify underspecified questions and apply it to several widely used QA datasets, finding that 16% to over 50% of benchmark questions are underspecified and that LLMs perform significantly worse on them. To isolate the effect of underspecification, we conduct a controlled rewriting experiment that serves as an upper-bound analysis, rewriting underspecified questions into fully specified variants while holding gold answers fixed. QA performance consistently improves under this setting, indicating that many apparent QA failures stem from question underspecification rather than model limitations. Our findings highlight underspecification as an important confound in QA evaluation and motivate greater attention to question clarity in benchmark design.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages of main text, 13 pages in total, 5 tables and 10 figures in total</p></details> |

The benchmark is derived from 200 professionally curated, multiple-choice problems from the Global Fortune-teller Competition (2021--2025), where each instance requires structured inference over a fixed symbolic chart and interacting temporal conditions. Unlike anecdotal or prompt-driven evaluations, BaziQA-Benchmark enables objective scoring and controlled comparison across years, domains, and model families. We evaluate contemporary language models under a multi-turn setting and analyze performance variation across temporal difficulty, reasoning domains, and inference protocols.To further probe reasoning behavior, we introduce a lightweight Structured Reasoning Protocol that constrains inference order without adding domain knowledge. Results show that models consistently outperform chance but remain far from saturation, exhibiting pronounced sensitivity to temporal composition and reasoning order, as well as systematic failures on precise temporal localization and multi-condition symbolic judgments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Blind Gods and Broken Screens: Architecting a Secure, Intent-Centric Mobile Agent Operating System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10915v3)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has shifted mobile computing from App-centric interactions to system-level autonomous agents. Current implementations predominantly rely on a "Screen-as-Interface" paradigm, which inherits structural vulnerabilities and conflicts with the mobile ecosystem's economic foundations. In this paper, we conduct a systematic security analysis of state-of-the-art mobile agents using Doubao Mobile Assistant as a representative case. We decompose the threat landscape into four dimensions - Agent Identity, External Interface, Internal Reasoning, and Action Execution - revealing critical flaws such as fake App identity, visual spoofing, indirect prompt injection, and unauthorized privilege escalation stemming from a reliance on unstructured visual data. To address these challenges, we propose Aura, an Agent Universal Runtime Architecture for a clean-slate secure agent OS. Aura replaces brittle GUI scraping with a structured, agent-native interaction model. It adopts a Hub-and-Spoke topology where a privileged System Agent orchestrates intent, sandboxed App Agents execute domain-specific tasks, and the Agent Kernel mediates all communication. The Agent Kernel enforces four defense pillars: (i) cryptographic identity binding via a Global Agent Registry; (ii) semantic input sanitization through a multilayer Semantic Firewall; (iii) cognitive integrity via taint-aware memory and plan-trajectory alignment; and (iv) granular access control with non-deniable auditing. Evaluation on MobileSafetyBench shows that, compared to Doubao, Aura improves low-risk Task Success Rate from roughly 75% to 94.3%, reduces high-risk Attack Success Rate from roughly 40% to 4.4%, and achieves near-order-of-magnitude latency gains. These results demonstrate Aura as a viable, secure alternative to the "Screen-as-Interface" paradigm.</p></details> | 35 pages, 15 figures |

We introduce a novel open-access dataset, Sociocultural Statements, constructed from natural debate statements using a multi-step methodology. The dataset is synthetically labeled to enable the quantization of sociocultural norms and beliefs that LLMs exhibit in their responses to these statements, according to the Hofstede cultural dimensions. We verify the accuracy of synthetic labels using human quality control on a representative sample. We conduct a comparative analysis between two groups of LLMs developed in different countries (U.S. and China), and use as a comparative baseline patterns observed in human measurements. Using this new dataset and the analysis above, we found that culturally-distinct LLMs reflect the values and norms of the countries in which they were developed, highlighting their inability to adapt to the sociocultural backgrounds of their users.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks for multimodal browsing remain limited in task complexity, evidence accessibility, and evaluation granularity, hindering comprehensive and reproducible assessments of deep search capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce BrowseComp-$V^3$, a novel benchmark consisting of 300 carefully curated and challenging questions spanning diverse domains. The benchmark emphasizes deep, multi-level, and cross-modal multi-hop reasoning, where critical evidence is interleaved across textual and visual modalities within and across web pages. All supporting evidence is strictly required to be publicly searchable, ensuring fairness and reproducibility. Beyond final-answer accuracy, we incorporate an expert-validated, subgoal-driven process evaluation mechanism that enables fine-grained analysis of intermediate reasoning behaviors and systematic characterization of capability boundaries. In addition, we propose OmniSeeker, a unified multimodal browsing agent framework integrating diverse web search and visual perception tools. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models achieve only 36% accuracy on our benchmark, revealing critical bottlenecks in multimodal information integration and fine-grained perception. Our results highlight a fundamental gap between current model capabilities and robust multimodal deep search in real-world settings.</p></details> |  |

Existing frameworks for educa-tional technologies and responsible AI primarily define desired behaviors, yet they rarely specify the knowledge prerequisites that enable generative systems to express these behaviors reliably. To address this gap, we adopt a knowledge-based design perspective and investigate what information tutor-ing-oriented GSRs require to function responsibly and effectively in higher education. Based on twelve semi-structured interviews with university stu-dents and lecturers, we identify twelve design requirements across three knowledge types: self-knowledge (assertive, conscientious and friendly per-sonality with customizable role), user-knowledge (personalized information about student learning goals, learning progress, motivation type, emotional state and background), and context-knowledge (learning materials, educa-tional strategies, course-related information, and physical learning environ-ment). By identifying these knowledge requirements, this work provides a structured foundation for the design of tutoring GSRs and future evaluations, aligning generative system capabilities with pedagogical and ethical expecta-tions.</p></details> |  |

Existing mental health benchmarks largely rely on social media data, limiting their ability to assess DSM-grounded diagnostic judgments. At the core of MentalBench is MentalKG, a psychiatrist-built and validated knowledge graph encoding DSM-5 diagnostic criteria and differential diagnostic rules for 23 psychiatric disorders. Using MentalKG as a golden-standard logical backbone, we generate 24,750 synthetic clinical cases that systematically vary in information completeness and diagnostic complexity, enabling low-noise and interpretable evaluation. Our experiments show that while state-of-the-art LLMs perform well on structured queries probing DSM-5 knowledge, they struggle to calibrate confidence in diagnostic decision-making when distinguishing between clinically overlapping disorders. These findings reveal evaluation gaps not captured by existing benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting Overflow in Compressed Token Representations for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12235v2)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient long-context processing remains a crucial challenge for contemporary large language models (LLMs), especially in resource-constrained environments. Soft compression architectures promise to extend effective context length by replacing long token sequences with smaller sets of learned compressed tokens. Yet, the limits of compressibility -- and when compression begins to erase task-relevant content -- remain underexplored. In this paper, we define token overflow as a regime in which compressed representations no longer contain sufficient information to answer a given query, and propose a methodology to characterize and detect it. In the xRAG soft-compression setting, we find that query-agnostic saturation statistics reliably separate compressed from uncompressed token representations, providing a practical tool for identifying compressed tokens but showing limited overflow detection capability. Lightweight probing classifiers over both query and context xRAG representations detect overflow with 0.72 AUC-ROC on average on HotpotQA, SQuADv2, and TriviaQA datasets, demonstrating that incorporating query information improves detection performance. These results advance from query-independent diagnostics to query-aware detectors, enabling low-cost pre-LLM gating to mitigate compression-induced errors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EACL 2026 Student Research Workshop. 14 pages, 6 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |
| **[Amortized Reasoning Tree Search: Decoupling Proposal and Decision in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12846v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has established itself as the dominant paradigm for instilling rigorous reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models. While effective at amplifying dominant behaviors, we identify a critical pathology in this alignment process: the systematic suppression of valid but rare (low-likelihood under the base model distribution) reasoning paths. We theoretically characterize this phenomenon as a "Normalization Squeeze," where the interplay between mode-seeking policy gradients and finite sampling acts as a high-pass likelihood filter, driving the probability of rare correct traces to statistical extinction. To counteract this collapse without discarding the base model's latent diversity, we propose Amortized Reasoning Tree Search (ARTS). Unlike standard approaches that force internalization via parameter updates, ARTS prioritizes deliberation by decoupling generation from verification. We introduce a Flow Matching objective that repurposes the verifier to estimate the conservation of probability flow, enabling robust navigation through sparse, high-entropy search spaces where traditional discriminative objectives fail. Extensive experiments on the MATH-500 benchmark demonstrate that ARTS achieves a performance of 74.6% (BoN@16), effectively matching fully fine-tuned policies (74.7%) without modifying the generative backbone. Crucially, on the long-tail subset where coupled RL optimization collapses to 0% pass@k, ARTS uniquely recovers significant performance, suggesting that disentangling verification from generation offers a more robust pathway for solving complex reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Formats for Weight Quantisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12988v3)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weight quantisation is an essential technique for enabling efficient training and deployment of modern deep learning models. However, the recipe book of quantisation formats is large and formats are often chosen empirically. In this paper, we propose a framework for systematic design and analysis of quantisation formats. By connecting the question of format design with the classical quantisation theory, we show that the strong practical performance of popular formats comes from their ability to represent values using variable-length codes. We frame the problem as minimising the KL divergence between original and quantised model outputs under a model size constraint, which can be approximated by minimising the squared quantisation error, a well-studied problem where entropy-constrained quantisers with variable-length codes are optimal. We develop non-linear quantisation curves for block-scaled data across multiple distribution families and observe that these formats, along with sparse outlier formats, consistently outperform fixed-length formats, indicating that they also exploit variable-length encoding. Finally, by using the relationship between the Fisher information and KL divergence, we derive the optimal allocation of bit-widths to individual parameter tensors across the model's layers, saving up to 0.25 bits per parameter when applied to large language models.</p></details> | 36 pages, 35 figures |

While such data could transform preventative care, its integration into clinical practice is hindered by its scale, heterogeneity and the time pressure and data literacy of healthcare professionals (HCPs). We explore how large language models (LLMs) can support sensemaking of patient-generated health data (PGHD) with automated summaries and natural language data exploration. Using cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction as a use case, 16 HCPs reviewed multimodal PGHD in a mixed-methods study with a prototype that integrated common charts, LLM-generated summaries, and a conversational interface. Findings show that AI summaries provided quick overviews that anchored exploration, while conversational interaction supported flexible analysis and bridged data-literacy gaps. However, HCPs raised concerns about transparency, privacy, and overreliance. We contribute empirical insights and sociotechnical design implications for integrating AI-driven summarization and conversation into clinical workflows to support PGHD sensemaking.</p></details> |  |
| **[TRACE: Temporal Reasoning via Agentic Context Evolution for Streaming Electronic Health Records (EHRs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12833v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) encode extensive medical knowledge but struggle to apply it reliably to longitudinal patient trajectories, where evolving clinical states, irregular timing, and heterogeneous events degrade performance over time. Existing adaptation strategies rely on fine-tuning or retrieval-based augmentation, which introduce computational overhead, privacy constraints, or instability under long contexts. We introduce TRACE (Temporal Reasoning via Agentic Context Evolution), a framework that enables temporal clinical reasoning with frozen LLMs by explicitly structuring and maintaining context rather than extending context windows or updating parameters. TRACE operates over a dual-memory architecture consisting of a static Global Protocol encoding institutional clinical rules and a dynamic Individual Protocol tracking patient-specific state. Four agentic components, Router, Reasoner, Auditor, and Steward, coordinate over this structured memory to support temporal inference and state evolution. The framework maintains bounded inference cost via structured state compression and selectively audits safety-critical clinical decisions. Evaluated on longitudinal clinical event streams from MIMIC-IV, TRACE significantly improves next-event prediction accuracy, protocol adherence, and clinical safety over long-context and retrieval-augmented baselines, while producing interpretable and auditable reasoning traces.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing resources, SciClaimEval features authentic claims, including refuted ones, directly extracted from published papers. To create refuted claims, we introduce a novel approach that modifies the supporting evidence (figures and tables), rather than altering the claims or relying on large language models (LLMs) to fabricate contradictions. The dataset provides cross-modal evidence with diverse representations: figures are available as images, while tables are provided in multiple formats, including images, LaTeX source, HTML, and JSON. SciClaimEval contains 1,664 annotated samples from 180 papers across three domains, machine learning, natural language processing, and medicine, validated through expert annotation. We benchmark 11 multimodal foundation models, both open-source and proprietary, across the dataset. Results show that figure-based verification remains particularly challenging for all models, as a substantial performance gap remains between the best system and human baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at LREC 2026; 12 pages; data is available at https://sciclaimeval.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[GRAIL: Geometry-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Inference with LLMs over Hyperbolic Representations of Patient Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12828v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting future clinical events from longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) is challenging due to sparse multi-type clinical events, hierarchical medical vocabularies, and the tendency of large language models (LLMs) to hallucinate when reasoning over long structured histories. We study next-visit event prediction, which aims to forecast a patient's upcoming clinical events based on prior visits. We propose GRAIL, a framework that models longitudinal EHRs using structured geometric representations and structure-aware retrieval. GRAIL constructs a unified clinical graph by combining deterministic coding-system hierarchies with data-driven temporal associations across event types, embeds this graph in hyperbolic space, and summarizes each visit as a probabilistic Central Event that denoises sparse observations. At inference time, GRAIL retrieves a structured set of clinically plausible future events aligned with hierarchical and temporal progression, and optionally refines their ranking using an LLM as a constrained inference-time reranker. Experiments on MIMIC-IV show that GRAIL consistently improves multi-type next-visit prediction and yields more hierarchy-consistent forecasts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Left-right asymmetry in predicting brain activity from LLMs' representations emerges with their formal linguistic competence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12811v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When humans and large language models (LLMs) process the same text, activations in the LLMs correlate with brain activity measured, e.g., with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Moreover, it has been shown that, as the training of an LLM progresses, the performance in predicting brain activity from its internal activations improves more in the left hemisphere than in the right one. The aim of the present work is to understand which kind of competence acquired by the LLMs underlies the emergence of this left-right asymmetry. Using the OLMo-2 7B language model at various training checkpoints and fMRI data from English participants, we compare the evolution of the left-right asymmetry in brain scores alongside performance on several benchmarks. We observe that the asymmetry co-emerges with the formal linguistic abilities of the LLM. These abilities are demonstrated in two ways: by the model's capacity to assign a higher probability to an acceptable sentence than to a grammatically unacceptable one within a minimal contrasting pair, or its ability to produce well-formed text. On the opposite, the left-right asymmetry does not correlate with the performance on arithmetic or Dyck language tasks; nor with text-based tasks involving world knowledge and reasoning. We generalize these results to another family of LLMs (Pythia) and another language, namely French. Our observations indicate that the left-right asymmetry in brain predictivity matches the progress in formal linguistic competence (knowledge of linguistic patterns).</p></details> |  |
| **[RAT-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Text Anonymization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12806v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data containing personal information is increasingly used to train, fine-tune, or query Large Language Models (LLMs). Text is typically scrubbed of identifying information prior to use, often with tools such as Microsoft's Presidio or Anthropic's PII purifier. These tools have traditionally been evaluated on their ability to remove specific identifiers (e.g., names), yet their effectiveness at preventing re-identification remains unclear. We introduce RAT-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for text anonymization tools based on re-identification risk. Using U.S. demographic statistics, we generate synthetic text containing various direct and indirect identifiers across domains, languages, and difficulty levels. We evaluate a range of NER- and LLM-based text anonymization tools and, based on the attributes an LLM-based attacker is able to correctly infer from the anonymized text, we report the risk of re-identification in the U.S. population, while properly accounting for the disparate impact of identifiers. We find that, while capabilities vary widely, even the best tools are far from perfect in particular when direct identifiers are not written in standard ways and when indirect identifiers enable re-identification. Overall we find LLM-based anonymizers, including new iterative anonymizers, to provide a better privacy-utility trade-off albeit at a higher computational cost. Importantly, we also find them to work well across languages. We conclude with recommendations for future anonymization tools and will release the benchmark and encourage community efforts to expand it, in particular to other geographies.</p></details> |  |
| **[WideSeek-R1: Exploring Width Scaling for Broad Information Seeking via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04634v2)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have largely focused on depth scaling, where a single agent solves long-horizon problems with multi-turn reasoning and tool use. However, as tasks grow broader, the key bottleneck shifts from individual competence to organizational capability. In this work, we explore a complementary dimension of width scaling with multi-agent systems to address broad information seeking. Existing multi-agent systems often rely on hand-crafted workflows and turn-taking interactions that fail to parallelize work effectively. To bridge this gap, we propose WideSeek-R1, a lead-agent-subagent framework trained via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to synergize scalable orchestration and parallel execution. By utilizing a shared LLM with isolated contexts and specialized tools, WideSeek-R1 jointly optimizes the lead agent and parallel subagents on a curated dataset of 20k broad information-seeking tasks. Extensive experiments show that WideSeek-R1-4B achieves an item F1 score of 40.0% on the WideSearch benchmark, which is comparable to the performance of single-agent DeepSeek-R1-671B. Furthermore, WideSeek-R1-4B exhibits consistent performance gains as the number of parallel subagents increases, highlighting the effectiveness of width scaling.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is withdrawn because it lacks the explicit approval of all authors</p></details> |

However, text feedback they provide is often unintelligible, generic, and not specific to user criteria. Inspired by structured rubrics in education and intelligible AI explanations, we propose iRULER following identified design guidelines to \textit{scaffold} the review process by \textit{specific} criteria, providing \textit{justification} for score selection, and offering \textit{actionable} revisions to target different quality levels. To \textit{qualify} user-defined criteria, we recursively used iRULER with a rubric-of-rubrics to iteratively \textit{refine} rubrics. In controlled experiments on writing revision and rubric creation, iRULER most improved validated LLM-judged review scores and was perceived as most helpful and aligned compared to read-only rubric and text-based LLM feedback. Qualitative findings further support how iRULER satisfies the design guidelines for user-defined feedback. This work contributes interactive rubric tools for intelligible LLM-based review and revision of writing, and user-defined rubric creation.</p></details> | <details><summary>To Ap...</summary><p>To Appear at CHI 2026</p></details> |

However, most existing multi-robot collaboration methods rely on extensive task-specific training, which limits their adaptability to new or diverse scenarios. Recent research leverages the language understanding and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to enable more flexible collaboration without specialized training. Yet, current LLM-empowered approaches remain inefficient: when confronted with identical or similar tasks, they must replan from scratch because they omit task-level similarities. To address this limitation, we propose MeCo, a similarity-aware multi-robot collaboration framework that applies the principle of ``cache and reuse'' (a.k.a., memoization) to reduce redundant computation. Unlike simple task repetition, identifying and reusing solutions for similar but not identical tasks is far more challenging, particularly in multi-robot settings. To this end, MeCo introduces a new similarity testing method that retrieves previously solved tasks with high relevance, enabling effective plan reuse without re-invoking LLMs. Furthermore, we present MeCoBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate performance on similar-task collaboration scenarios. Experimental results show that MeCo substantially reduces planning costs and improves success rates compared with state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Measure-to-measure interpolation using Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04551v3)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers are deep neural network architectures that underpin the recent successes of large language models. Unlike more classical architectures that can be viewed as point-to-point maps, a Transformer acts as a measure-to-measure map implemented as specific interacting particle system on the unit sphere: the input is the empirical measure of tokens in a prompt and its evolution is governed by the continuity equation. In fact, Transformers are not limited to empirical measures and can in principle process any input measure. As the nature of data processed by Transformers is expanding rapidly, it is important to investigate their expressive power as maps from an arbitrary measure to another arbitrary measure. To that end, we provide an explicit choice of parameters that allows a single Transformer to match $N$ arbitrary input measures to $N$ arbitrary target measures, under the minimal assumption that every pair of input-target measures can be matched by some transport map.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Foundations of Computational Mathematics</p></details> |
| **[Closing the Loop: A Control-Theoretic Framework for Provably Stable Time Series Forecasting with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12756v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown exceptional potential in time series forecasting, leveraging their inherent sequential reasoning capabilities to model complex temporal dynamics. However, existing approaches typically employ a naive autoregressive generation strategy. We identify a critical theoretical flaw in this paradigm: during inference, the model operates in an open-loop manner, consuming its own generated outputs recursively. This leads to inevitable error accumulation (exposure bias), where minor early deviations cascade into significant trajectory drift over long horizons. In this paper, we reformulate autoregressive forecasting through the lens of control theory, proposing \textbf{F-LLM} (Feedback-driven LLM), a novel closed-loop framework. Unlike standard methods that passively propagate errors, F-LLM actively stabilizes the trajectory via a learnable residual estimator (Observer) and a feedback controller. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee that our closed-loop mechanism ensures uniformly bounded error, provided the base model satisfies a local Lipschitz constraint. Extensive experiments demonstrate that F-LLM significantly mitigates error propagation, achieving good performance on time series benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[MLLM-CTBench: A Benchmark for Continual Instruction Tuning with Reasoning Process Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08275v3)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual instruction tuning(CIT) during the post-training phase is crucial for adapting multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to evolving real-world demands. However, the progress is hampered by the lack of benchmarks with rigorous, protocol-consistent evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce MLLM-CTBench, a comprehensive benchmark for CIT of MLLMs, covering seven challenging tasks across six diverse domains. MLLM-CTBench makes three key contributions. First, we establish a multidimensional evaluation framework that jointly assesses final-answer accuracy and process-level reasoning quality, where Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces serve as an observable signal to diagnose catastrophic forgetting beyond answer-only evaluation. Second, we conduct a large-scale evaluation of continual learning methods by systematically assessing eight representative algorithms from four major families under a unified protocol across task orders, providing actionable insights for algorithm design. Third, we expand the scope from Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) in CIT. By investigating GRPO, an on-policy RL algorithm that stabilizes updates through explicit KL-divergence control to a prior policy, we aim to analyze how this mechanism affects cross-task knowledge retention. Our experiments yield several findings:(1) Process-level reasoning quality is often more resilient to catastrophic forgetting than final-answer accuracy, and forgetting is primarily driven by degradation in domain knowledge. (2) Model capability is critical factor influencing continual learning outcomes, with stronger baseline models exhibiting greater resistance to catastrophic forgetting. (3) On-policy RFT (GRPO), with its inherent KL control, achieves more stable cross-task retention than SFT. While removing KL control can amplify forgetting despite potential gains on new ones.</p></details> | under review |

Recent work leverages large language models to automate this process, but typically evaluates success using weak signals such as dependency installation or partial test execution, which do not ensure that a project can actually run. In this paper, we argue that environment setup success should be evaluated through executable evidence rather than a single binary signal. We introduce the Environment Maturity Hierarchy, which defines three success levels based on progressively stronger execution requirements, culminating in successful execution of a project's main entry point. Guided by this hierarchy, we propose HerAgent, an automated environment setup approach that incrementally constructs executable environments through execution-based validation and repair. We evaluate HerAgent on four public benchmarks, where it outperforms all related work, achieving up to 79.6\% improvement due to its holistic understanding of project structure and dependencies. On complex C/C++ projects, HerAgent surpasses prior approaches by 66.7\%. In addition, HerAgent uniquely resolves 11-30 environment instances across the benchmarks that no prior method can configure.</p></details> |  |

Traditional tools like the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) were validated in high-income countries but may be linguistically or culturally inaccessible for low- and middle-income countries and communities such as Nigeria where people communicate in Nigerian Pidgin and more than 520 local languages. This study presents a novel approach to automated depression screening using fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) adapted for conversational Nigerian Pidgin. We collected a dataset of 432 Pidgin-language audio responses from Nigerian young adults aged 18-40 to prompts assessing psychological experiences aligned with PHQ-9 items, performed transcription, rigorous preprocessing and annotation, including semantic labeling, slang and idiom interpretation, and PHQ-9 severity scoring. Three LLMs - Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct, Gemma-3-4B-it, and GPT-4.1 - were fine-tuned on this annotated dataset, and their performance was evaluated quantitatively (accuracy, precision and semantic alignment) and qualitatively (clarity, relevance, and cultural appropriateness). GPT-4.1 achieved the highest quantitative performance, with 94.5% accuracy in PHQ-9 severity scoring prediction, outperforming Gemma-3-4B-it and Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct. Qualitatively, GPT-4.1 also produced the most culturally appropriate, clear, and contextually relevant responses. AI-mediated depression screening for underserved Nigerian communities.

However, we show this assumption often fails in practice. Through systematic encoder masking across representative multi encoder MLLMs, we find that performance typically degrades gracefully, and sometimes even improves, when selected encoders are masked, revealing pervasive encoder redundancy. To quantify this effect, we introduce two principled metrics: the Conditional Utilization Rate (CUR), which measures an encoder s marginal contribution in the presence of others, and the Information Gap (IG), which captures heterogeneity in encoder utility within a model. Using these tools, we observe: (i) strong specialization on tasks like OCR and Chart, where a single encoder can dominate with a CUR greater than 90 percent, (ii) high redundancy on general VQA and knowledge based tasks, where encoders are largely interchangeable, (iii) instances of detrimental encoders with negative CUR. Notably, masking specific encoders can yield up to 16 percent higher accuracy on a specific task category and 3.6 percent overall performance boost compared to the full model.Furthermore, single and dual encoder variants recover over 90 percent of baseline on most non OCR tasks with substantially lower training resources and inference latency. Our analysis challenges the more encoders are better heuristic in MLLMs and provides actionable diagnostics for developing more efficient and effective multimodal architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ICLR2026, project website: https://github.com/MaoSong2022/Encoder-Redundancy</p></details> |
| **[Training Dense Retrievers with Multiple Positive Passages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12727v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern knowledge-intensive systems, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), rely on effective retrievers to establish the performance ceiling for downstream modules. However, retriever training has been bottlenecked by sparse, single-positive annotations, which lead to false-negative noise and suboptimal supervision. While the advent of large language models (LLMs) makes it feasible to collect comprehensive multi-positive relevance labels at scale, the optimal strategy for incorporating these dense signals into training remains poorly understood. In this paper, we present a systematic study of multi-positive optimization objectives for retriever training. We unify representative objectives, including Joint Likelihood (JointLH), Summed Marginal Likelihood (SumMargLH), and Log-Sum-Exp Pairwise (LSEPair) loss, under a shared contrastive learning framework. Our theoretical analysis characterizes their distinct gradient behaviors, revealing how each allocates probability mass across positive document sets. Empirically, we conduct extensive evaluations on Natural Questions, MS MARCO, and the BEIR benchmark across two realistic regimes: homogeneous LLM-annotated data and heterogeneous mixtures of human and LLM labels. Our results show that LSEPair consistently achieves superior robustness and performance across settings, while JointLH and SumMargLH exhibit high sensitivity to the quality of positives. Furthermore, we find that the simple strategy of random sampling (Rand1LH) serves as a reliable baseline. By aligning theoretical insights with empirical findings, we provide practical design principles for leveraging dense, LLM-augmented supervision to enhance retriever effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Layer-wise Swapping for Generalizable Multilingual Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22620v2)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the rapid advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs), safety risks remain a critical challenge for low-resource languages. Existing safety datasets are predominantly English centric, limiting progress in multilingual safety alignment. As a result, low resource expert models, finetuned on their respective instruction datasets, tend to exhibit higher unsafety rates compared to their high resource counterparts. In this work, we propose a safety aware layer swapping method that transfers safety alignment from an English safety expert to low resource language experts without additional training. To further enhance transfer ability, our method adaptively selects or blends modules based on their degree of specialization. Our approach preserves performance on general language understanding tasks while enhancing safety in the target languages. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves comparable performance to the language expert on general benchmarks such as MMMLU, BELEBELE, and MGSM, while producing more aligned and less harmful responses on the MultiJail safety benchmark.</p></details> | EACL 2026 main |
| **[ADEPT: RL-Aligned Agentic Decoding of Emotion via Evidence Probing Tools -- From Consensus Learning to Ambiguity-Driven Emotion Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12714v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech Large Language Models (SLLMs) enable high-level emotion reasoning but often produce ungrounded, text-biased judgments without verifiable acoustic evidence. In contrast, self-supervised speech encoders such as WavLM provide strong acoustic representations yet remain opaque discriminative models with limited interpretability. To bridge this gap, we introduce ADEPT (Agentic Decoding of Emotion via Evidence Probing Tools), a framework that reframes emotion recognition as a multi-turn inquiry process rather than a single-pass prediction. ADEPT transforms an SLLM into an agent that maintains an evolving candidate emotion set and adaptively invokes dedicated semantic and acoustic probing tools within a structured pipeline of candidate generation, evidence collection, and adjudication. Crucially, ADEPT enables a paradigm shift from consensus learning to ambiguity-driven emotion reasoning. Since human affect exhibits inherent complexity and frequent co-occurrence of emotions, we treat minority annotations as informative perceptual signals rather than discarding them as noise. Finally, we integrate Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with an Evidence Trust Gate to explicitly couple tool-usage behaviors with prediction quality and enforce evidence-grounded reasoning. Experiments show that ADEPT improves primary emotion accuracy in most settings while substantially improving minor emotion characterization, producing explanations grounded in auditable acoustic and semantic evidence.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Provable Training Data Identification for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09717v2)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying training data of large-scale models is critical for copyright litigation, privacy auditing, and ensuring fair evaluation. However, existing works typically treat this task as an instance-wise identification without controlling the error rate of the identified set, which cannot provide statistically reliable evidence. In this work, we formalize training data identification as a set-level inference problem and propose Provable Training Data Identification (PTDI), a distribution-free approach that enables provable and strict false identification rate control. Specifically, our method computes conformal p-values for each data point using a set of known unseen data and then develops a novel Jackknife-corrected Beta boundary (JKBB) estimator to estimate the training-data proportion of the test set, which allows us to scale these p-values. By applying the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure to the scaled p-values, we select a subset of data points with provable and strict false identification control. Extensive experiments across various models and datasets demonstrate that PTDI achieves higher power than prior methods while strictly controlling the FIR.</p></details> |  |
| **[RPG: A Repository Planning Graph for Unified and Scalable Codebase Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16198v6)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models excel at generating individual functions or single files of code, yet generating complete repositories from scratch remains a fundamental challenge. This capability is key to building coherent software systems from high-level specifications and realizing the full potential of automated code generation. The process requires planning at two levels: deciding what features and modules to build (proposal stage) and defining their implementation details (implementation stage). Current approaches rely on natural language planning, which often produces unclear specifications, misaligned components, and brittle designs due to its inherent ambiguity and lack of structure. To address these limitations, we introduce the Repository Planning Graph (RPG), a structured representation that encodes capabilities, file structures, data flows, and functions in a unified graph. By replacing free-form natural language with an explicit blueprint, RPG enables consistent long-horizon planning for repository generation. Building on RPG, we develop ZeroRepo, a graph-driven framework that operates in three stages: proposal-level planning, implementation-level construction, and graph-guided code generation with test validation. To evaluate, we construct RepoCraft, a benchmark of six real-world projects with 1,052 tasks. On RepoCraft, ZeroRepo produces nearly 36K Code Lines and 445K Code Tokens, on average 3.9$\times$ larger than the strongest baseline (Claude Code), and 68$\times$ larger than other baselines. It achieves 81.5% coverage and 69.7% test accuracy, improving over Claude Code by 27.3 and 35.8 points. Further analysis shows that RPG models complex dependencies, enables more sophisticated planning through near-linear scaling, and improves agent understanding of repositories, thus accelerating localization.

A core design choice is how to fuse retrieved samples into the LLMs, where existing internal fusion approaches broadly fall into query-based fusion, parametric fusion, and latent-based fusion. Despite their effectiveness at modest retrieval scales, these methods often fail to scale gracefully as the number of retrieved candidates k increases: Larger k improves evidence coverage, yet realistic top-k retrieval inevitably contains irrelevant or redundant content and increases the inference cost. To address these limitations, we propose ReFilter, a novel latent-based fusion framework that performs token-level filtering and fusion. ReFilter consists of three key components: a context encoder for encoding context features, a gated filter for weighting each token, and a token fusion module for integrating the weighted token feature into the LLM's hidden states. Our experiments across four general-domain QA benchmarks show that ReFilter consistently achieves the best average performance under both in-domain adaptation and out-of-domain transfer. ReFilter further generalizes to five biomedical QA benchmarks in zero-shot transfer without domain fine-tuning, reaching 70.01% average accuracy with Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct.</p></details> |  |

Existing simulation-based data generation methods for such scenarios rely heavily on costly autoregressive interactions between multiple LLM agents, thereby compromising the practical efficiency of agentic data generation. In this paper, we propose ToolACE-MT, a novel Non-Autoregressive Iterative Generation framework for constructing high-quality multi-turn agentic dialogues. ToolACE-MT generates full conversational trajectories through three stages: coarse-grained initialization, iterative refinement, and offline verification. The initialization phase builds a structurally complete yet semantically coarse dialogue skeleton; the iterative refinement phase introduces realistic complexities and continued refinement via mask-and-fill operations; and the offline verification phase ensures correctness and coherence via rule- and model-based checks. Experiments demonstrate that ToolACE-MT enables efficient, effective and generalizable agentic data generation, offering a new paradigm for high-quality data construction in tool-augmented LLM scenarios.</p></details> | Accepted by ICLR2026 |

Inputting user-generated sentences, which are likely to contain missing or incorrect punctuation, results in fluent but semantically disastrous translations. This work attempts to highlight and address the problem of punctuation robustness of NMT systems through an English-to-Marathi translation. First, we introduce \textbf{\textit{Viram}}, a human-curated diagnostic benchmark of 54 punctuation-ambiguous English-Marathi sentence pairs to stress-test existing NMT systems. Second, we evaluate two simple remediation strategies: cascade-based \textit{restore-then-translate} and \textit{direct fine-tuning}. Our experimental results and analysis demonstrate that both strategies yield substantial NMT performance improvements. Furthermore, we find that current Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit relatively poorer robustness in translating such sentences than these task-specific strategies, thus necessitating further research in this area. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/KaustubhShejole/Viram_Marathi.</p></details> |  |
| **[SGM: Safety Glasses for Multimodal Large Language Models via Neuron-Level Detoxification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15052v3)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Disclaimer: Samples in this paper may be harmful and cause discomfort. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable multimodal generation but inherit toxic, biased, and NSFW signals from weakly curated pretraining corpora, causing safety risks, especially under adversarial triggers that late, opaque training-free detoxification methods struggle to handle. We propose SGM, a white-box neuron-level multimodal intervention that acts like safety glasses for toxic neurons: it selectively recalibrates a small set of toxic expert neurons via expertise-weighted soft suppression, neutralizing harmful cross-modal activations without any parameter updates. We establish MM-TOXIC-QA, a multimodal toxicity evaluation framework, and compare SGM with existing detoxification techniques. Experiments on open-source MLLMs show that SGM mitigates toxicity in standard and adversarial conditions, cutting harmful rates from 48.2\% to 2.5\% while preserving fluency and multimodal reasoning. SGM is extensible, and its combined defenses, denoted as SGM*, integrate with existing detoxification methods for stronger safety performance, providing an interpretable, low-cost solution for toxicity-controlled multimodal generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[GISA: A Benchmark for General Information-Seeking Assistant](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08543v2)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly accelerated the development of search agents capable of autonomously gathering information through multi-turn web interactions. Various benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate such agents. However, existing benchmarks often construct queries backward from answers, producing unnatural tasks misaligned with real-world needs. Moreover, these benchmarks tend to focus on either locating specific information or aggregating information from multiple sources, while relying on static answer sets prone to data contamination. To bridge these gaps, we introduce GISA, a benchmark for General Information-Seeking Assistants comprising 373 human-crafted queries that reflect authentic information-seeking scenarios. GISA features four structured answer formats (item, set, list, and table), enabling deterministic evaluation. It integrates both deep reasoning and broad information aggregation within unified tasks, and includes a live subset with periodically updated answers to resist memorization. Notably, GISA provides complete human search trajectories for every query, offering gold-standard references for process-level supervision and imitation learning. Experiments on mainstream LLMs and commercial search products reveal that even the best-performing model achieves only 19.30\% exact match score, with performance notably degrading on tasks requiring complex planning and comprehensive information gathering. These findings highlight substantial room for future improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project repo: https://github.com/RUC-NLPIR/GISA</p></details> |
| **[PReSS: A Black-Box Framework for Evaluating Political Stance Stability in LLMs via Argumentative Pressure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17052v3)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing evaluations of political bias in large language models (LLMs) typically classify outputs as left- or right-leaning. We extend this perspective by examining how ideological tendencies vary across topics and how consistently models maintain their positions, a property we refer to as stability. To capture this dimension, we propose PReSS (Political Response Stability under Stress), a black-box framework that evaluates LLMs by jointly considering model and topic context, categorizing responses into four stance types: stable-left, unstable-left, stable-right, and unstable-right. Applying PReSS to 12 widely used LLMs across 19 political topics reveals substantial variation in stance stability; for instance, a model that is left-leaning overall can exhibit stable-right behavior on certain topics. This highlights the importance of topic-aware and fine-grained evaluation of political ideologies of LLMs. Moreover, stability has practical implications for controlled generation and model alignment: interventions such as debiasing or ideology reversal should explicitly account for stance stability. Our empirical analyses reveal that when models are prompted or fine-tuned to adopt the opposite ideology, unstable topic stances are more likely to change, whereas stable ones resist modification. Thus, treating stability as a moderating factor provides a principled foundation for understanding, evaluating, and guiding interventions in politically sensitive model behavior.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |

While existing distillation approaches focus on imitating teacher behavior, they often overlook the original learning environment that shaped the teacher's knowledge. Inspired by the experiential learning theory and inverse reinforcement learning, we propose Experiential Knowledge Distillation ($\mathcal{X}$-KD), a novel and general framework that enables student models to learn in the teacher's original learning environment. $\mathcal{X}$-KD adopts the Approximated Variational Reward Imitation Learning (AVRIL) framework to jointly model the teacher's original reward function and perform policy distillation, encouraging consistency between the student policy and the original reward function. Our derivation demonstrates that $\mathcal{X}$-KD follows the supervised learning framework and applies to both sequence-level and divergence-based distillation methods, underlining the simplicity and flexibility of our approach. Empirical results show that $\mathcal{X}$-KD outperforms the generalized KD and MiniLLM baselines on abstractive summarization, machine translation, and arithmetic reasoning tasks. Additionally, $\mathcal{X}$-KD achieves better performance-diversity trade-off and data efficiency than baseline KD approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Characterize LSM-tree Compaction Performance via On-Device LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12669v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern key-value storage engines built on Log-Structured Merge-trees (LSM-trees), such as RocksDB and LevelDB, rely heavily on the performance of their compaction operations, which are impacted by a complex set of interdependent configuration parameters. Manually tuning these parameters for optimal performance demands considerable expertise, while traditional auto-tuning approaches struggle with the enormous search space and low sample efficiency inherent to this domain. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in code generation and logical reasoning, offering new possibilities for system optimization. However, applying LLMs to real-time compaction tuning in such latency-sensitive environments is a double-edged sword. While large-scale LLMs can offer superior reasoning for strategy generation, their high inference latency and computational cost make them impractical for interactive, low-latency tuning. In contrast, small-scale LLMs achieve low latency but often at the expense of reasoning accuracy and tuning effectiveness. In this paper, we first evaluate this trade-off by analyzing the compaction-tuning performance and inference latency of LLMs at different scales in an LSM-tree-based tuning case. We then characterize the performance of LSM-tree on RocksDB v8.8.1, with a focus on adjusting the key compaction-related parameters under db_bench workloads. Our experimental results show a clear positive correlation between model capability and tuning effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

However, although frontier AI systems represented by large language models (LLMs) have developed rapidly in recent years, their capabilities in this scope are still understudied. In this paper, we introduce PoliCon, a novel benchmark constructed from 2,225 high-quality deliberation records of the European Parliament over 13 years, ranging from 2009 to 2022, to evaluate the ability of LLMs to draft consensus resolutions based on divergent party positions under varying collective decision-making contexts and political requirements. Specifically, PoliCon incorporates four factors to build each task environment for finding different political consensus: specific political issues, political goals, participating parties, and power structures based on seat distribution. We also developed an evaluation framework based on social choice theory for PoliCon, which simulates the real voting outcomes of different political parties to assess whether LLM-generated resolutions meet the requirements of the predetermined political consensus. Our experimental results demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models remain undersatisfied with complex tasks like passing resolutions by a two-thirds majority and addressing security issues, while uncovering their inherent partisan biases and revealing some behaviors LLMs show to achieve the consensus, such as prioritizing the stance of the dominant party instead of uniting smaller parties, which highlights PoliCon's promise as an effective platform for studying LLMs' ability to promote political consensus. The code and dataset are released at https://zowiezhang.github.io/projects/PoliCon.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2026</p></details> |

These monitors continuously record system-level activities as audit logs and provide deep visibility into security events. Unfortunately, existing methods of semantic analysis based on audit logs have low granularity, only reaching the system call level, making it difficult to effectively classify highly covert behaviors. Additionally, existing works mainly match audit log streams with rule knowledge bases describing behaviors, which heavily rely on expertise and lack the ability to detect unknown attacks and provide interpretive descriptions. In this paper, we propose SmartGuard, an automated method that combines abstracted behaviors from audit event semantics with large language models. SmartGuard extracts specific behaviors (function level) from incoming system logs and constructs a knowledge graph, divides events by threads, and combines event summaries with graph embeddings to achieve information diagnosis and provide explanatory narratives through large language models. Our evaluation shows that SmartGuard achieves an average F1 score of 96\% in assessing malicious behaviors and demonstrates good scalability across multiple models and unknown attacks. It also possesses excellent fine-tuning capabilities, allowing experts to assist in timely system updates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Think Fast and Slow: Step-Level Cognitive Depth Adaptation for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12662v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents for multi-turn decision-making tasks. However, current agents typically rely on fixed cognitive patterns: non-thinking models generate immediate responses, while thinking models engage in deep reasoning uniformly. This rigidity is inefficient for long-horizon tasks, where cognitive demands vary significantly from step to step, with some requiring strategic planning and others only routine execution. In this paper, we introduce CogRouter, a framework that trains agents to dynamically adapt cognitive depth at each step. Grounded in ACT-R theory, we design four hierarchical cognitive levels ranging from instinctive responses to strategic planning. Our two-stage training approach includes Cognition-aware Supervised Fine-tuning (CoSFT) to instill stable level-specific patterns, and Cognition-aware Policy Optimization (CoPO) for step-level credit assignment via confidence-aware advantage reweighting. The key insight is that appropriate cognitive depth should maximize the confidence of the resulting action. Experiments on ALFWorld and ScienceWorld demonstrate that CogRouter achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior efficiency. With Qwen2.5-7B, it reaches an 82.3% success rate, outperforming GPT-4o (+40.3%), OpenAI-o3 (+18.3%), and GRPO (+14.0%), while using 62% fewer tokens.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Ordinal Probabilistic Reward from Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12660v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward models are crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values and intentions. Existing approaches follow either Generative (GRMs) or Discriminative (DRMs) paradigms, yet both suffer from limitations: GRMs typically demand costly point-wise supervision, while DRMs produce uncalibrated relative scores that lack probabilistic interpretation. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel reward modeling paradigm: Probabilistic Reward Model (PRM). Instead of modeling reward as a deterministic scalar, our approach treats it as a random variable, learning a full probability distribution for the quality of each response. To make this paradigm practical, we present its closed-form, discrete realization: the Ordinal Probabilistic Reward Model (OPRM), which discretizes the quality score into a finite set of ordinal ratings. Building on OPRM, we propose a data-efficient training strategy called Region Flooding Tuning (RgFT). It enables rewards to better reflect absolute text quality by incorporating quality-level annotations, which guide the model to concentrate the probability mass within corresponding rating sub-regions. Experiments on various reward model benchmarks show that our method improves accuracy by $\textbf{2.9%}\sim\textbf{7.4%}$ compared to prior reward models, demonstrating strong performance and data efficiency. Analysis of the score distribution provides evidence that our method captures not only relative rankings but also absolute quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 5 figures, ICLR 2026</p></details> |

This makes interaction between humans and AI more intuitive, akin to chatting with a real person. However, a fundamental mismatch exists between current RTC frameworks and AI Video Assistants, stemming from the drastic shift in Quality of Experience (QoE) and more challenging networks. Measurements on our production prototype also confirm that current RTC fails, causing latency spikes and accuracy drops. To address these challenges, we propose Artic, an AI-oriented RTC framework for MLLM Video Assistants, exploring the shift from "humans watching video" to "AI understanding video." Specifically, Artic proposes: (1) Response Capability-aware Adaptive Bitrate, which utilizes MLLM accuracy saturation to proactively cap bitrate, reserving bandwidth headroom to absorb future fluctuations for latency reduction; (2) Zero-overhead Context-aware Streaming, which allocates limited bitrate to regions most important for the response, maintaining accuracy even under ultra-low bitrates; and (3) Degraded Video Understanding Benchmark, the first benchmark evaluating how RTC-induced video degradation affects MLLM accuracy. Prototype experiments using real-world uplink traces show that compared with existing methods, Artic significantly improves accuracy by 15.12% and reduces latency by 135.31 ms. We will release the benchmark and codes at https://github.com/pku-netvideo/DeViBench.</p></details> |  |

Recent research indicates that using VLMs yields better RAG performance, but processing rich documents remains a challenge since a single page contains large amounts of information. In this paper, we present SCAN (SemantiC Document Layout ANalysis), a novel approach that enhances both textual and visual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems that work with visually rich documents. It is a VLM-friendly approach that identifies document components with appropriate semantic granularity, balancing context preservation with processing efficiency. SCAN uses a coarse-grained semantic approach that divides documents into coherent regions covering contiguous components. We trained the SCAN model by fine-tuning object detection models on an annotated dataset. Our experimental results across English and Japanese datasets demonstrate that applying SCAN improves end-to-end textual RAG performance by up to 9.4 points and visual RAG performance by up to 10.4 points, outperforming conventional approaches and even commercial document processing solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLASE: A Hybrid Method for Chinese Legalese Stylistic Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12639v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Legal text generated by large language models (LLMs) can usually achieve reasonable factual accuracy, but it frequently fails to adhere to the specialised stylistic norms and linguistic conventions of legal writing. In order to improve stylistic quality, a crucial first step is to establish a reliable evaluation method. However, having legal experts manually develop such a metric is impractical, as the implicit stylistic requirements in legal writing practice are difficult to formalise into explicit rubrics. Meanwhile, existing automatic evaluation methods also fall short: reference-based metrics conflate semantic accuracy with stylistic fidelity, and LLM-as-a-judge evaluations suffer from opacity and inconsistency. To address these challenges, we introduce CLASE (Chinese LegAlese Stylistic Evaluation), a hybrid evaluation method that focuses on the stylistic performance of legal text. The method incorporates a hybrid scoring mechanism that combines 1) linguistic feature-based scores and 2) experience-guided LLM-as-a-judge scores. Both the feature coefficients and the LLM scoring experiences are learned from contrastive pairs of authentic legal documents and their LLM-restored counterparts. This hybrid design captures both surface-level features and implicit stylistic norms in a transparent, reference-free manner. Experiments on 200 Chinese legal documents show that CLASE achieves substantially higher alignment with human judgments than traditional metrics and pure LLM-as-a-judge methods. Beyond improved alignment, CLASE provides interpretable score breakdowns and suggestions for improvements, offering a scalable and practical solution for professional stylistic evaluation in legal text generation (Code and data for CLASE is available at: https://github.com/rexera/CLASE).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at LREC 2026</p></details> |

However, such algorithms often rely on rigid modeling assumptions and can perform poorly when demand distributions shift or relevant contextual information is unavailable. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have generated interest in AI agents that can reason flexibly and incorporate rich contextual signals, but it remains unclear how best to incorporate LLM-based methods into traditional decision-making pipelines. We study how OR algorithms, LLMs, and humans can interact and complement each other in a multi-period inventory control setting. We construct InventoryBench, a benchmark of over 1,000 inventory instances spanning both synthetic and real-world demand data, designed to stress-test decision rules under demand shifts, seasonality, and uncertain lead times. Through this benchmark, we find that OR-augmented LLM methods outperform either method in isolation, suggesting that these methods are complementary rather than substitutes. We further investigate the role of humans through a controlled classroom experiment that embeds LLM recommendations into a human-in-the-loop decision pipeline. Contrary to prior findings that human-AI collaboration can degrade performance, we show that, on average, human-AI teams achieve higher profits than either humans or AI agents operating alone. Beyond this population-level finding, we formalize an individual-level complementarity effect and derive a distribution-free lower bound on the fraction of individuals who benefit from AI collaboration; empirically, we find this fraction to be substantial.</p></details> |  |

We critically ask how to achieve verifiable LLM inference, where a prover (the service) must convince a verifier (the client) that an inference was run correctly without rerunning the LLM. Existing cryptographic works are too slow at the LLM scale, while non-cryptographic ones require a strong verifier GPU. We propose TensorCommitments (TCs), a tensor-native proof-of-inference scheme. TC binds the LLM inference to a commitment, an irreversible tag that breaks under tampering, organized in our multivariate Terkle Trees. For LLaMA2, TC adds only 0.97% prover and 0.12% verifier time over inference while improving robustness to tailored LLM attacks by up to 48% over the best prior work requiring a verifier GPU.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 8 figures, under review</p></details> |

Overcoming these reproducibility gaps does not mean enforcing a one-size-fits-all evaluation. Rather, effective benchmarking requires diverse experimental approaches and a framework robust enough to support them. To this end, we introduce HRET (Haerae Evaluation Toolkit), an open-source, registry-based framework that unifies Korean LLM assessment. HRET integrates major Korean benchmarks, multiple inference backends, and multi-method evaluation, with language consistency enforcement to ensure genuine Korean outputs. Its modular registry design also enables rapid incorporation of new datasets, methods, and backends, ensuring the toolkit adapts to evolving research needs. Beyond standard accuracy metrics, HRET incorporates Korean-focused output analyses-morphology-aware Type-Token Ratio (TTR) for evaluating lexical diversity and systematic keyword-omission detection for identifying missing concepts-to provide diagnostic insights into language-specific behaviors. These targeted analyses help researchers pinpoint morphological and semantic shortcomings in model outputs, guiding focused improvements in Korean LLM development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at LREC 2026</p></details> |

Prior pruning methods operate either before the LLM, limiting generality due to diverse encoder-projector designs or within the LLM using heuristics that are incompatible with FlashAttention. We take a different approach: rather than identifying unimportant tokens, we treat the LLM itself as the optimal guide for compression. Observing that deeper layers naturally transmit vision-to-text information, we introduce Attention-Driven Self-Compression (ADSC), a simple, broadly applicable method that progressively reduces vision tokens using only the LLM's attention mechanism. Our method applies uniform token downsampling at selected layers, forming bottlenecks that encourage the model to reorganize and compress information into the remaining tokens. It requires no score computation, auxiliary modules, or attention modification, and remains fully compatible with FlashAttention. Applied to LLaVA-1.5, ADSC reduces FLOPs by 53.7% and peak KV-cache memory by 56.7%, while preserving 98.2% of the original model performance. Across multiple benchmarks, it outperforms prior pruning approaches in both efficiency and accuracy. Crucially, under high compression ratios, our method remains robust while heuristic-based techniques degrade sharply.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (BigData)</p></details> |

Recent advances in Vicinal Risk Minimization (VRM) have shown promise in mitigating class imbalance with numeric interpolation; however, existing approaches largely rely on embedding-space arithmetic, which fails to capture the rich semantics inherent in text-attributed graphs. In this work, we propose our method, SaVe-TAG (Semantic-aware Vicinal Risk Minimization for Long-Tailed Text-Attributed Graphs), a novel VRM framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform text-level interpolation, generating on-manifold, boundary-enriching synthetic samples for minority classes. To mitigate the risk of noisy generation, we introduce a confidence-based edge assignment mechanism that uses graph topology as a natural filter to ensure structural consistency. We provide theoretical justification for our method and conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, showing that our approach consistently outperforms both numeric interpolation and prior long-tailed node classification baselines. Our results highlight the importance of integrating semantic and structural signals for balanced and effective learning on text-attributed graphs.

The system consists of two components: (1) a social navigation framework implemented on a Raspberry Pi 5 that integrates real-time RGB-D perception using an OAK-D Lite camera, YOLOv8-based object detection, COMPOSER-based collective activity recognition, D* Lite dynamic path planning, and haptic feedback via vibration motors for tasks such as locating a vacant seat; and (2) an agentic multimodal LLM-VLM interaction framework that integrates speech recognition, vision language models, large language models, and text-to-speech, with dynamic routing between voice-only and vision-only modes to enable natural voice-based communication, scene description, and object localization from visual input. The system is evaluated through a combination of simulation-based tests, real-world field experiments, and user-centered studies. Results from simulated and real indoor environments demonstrate reliable obstacle avoidance and socially compliant navigation, achieving an overall system accuracy of approximately 80% under different social conditions. Group activity recognition further shows robust performance across diverse crowd scenarios. In addition, a preliminary exploratory user study with eight visually impaired and low-vision participants evaluates the agentic interaction framework through structured tasks and a UTAUT-based questionnaire reveals high acceptance and positive perceptions of usability, trust, and perceived sociability during our experiments. The results highlight the potential of PISHYAR as a multimodal assistive mobility aid that extends beyond navigation to provide socially interactive support for such users.</p></details> |  |

However, in practice, their inference efficiency is constrained by the need for many refinement steps, while aggressively reducing the number of steps leads to a substantial degradation in generation quality. To alleviate this, we propose a trajectory self-distillation framework that improves few-step decoding by distilling the model's own generative trajectories. We incorporate Direct Discriminative Optimization (DDO), a reverse-KL objective that promotes mode-seeking distillation and encourages the student to concentrate on high-probability teacher modes. Across benchmarks, our approach consistently outperforms strong few-step baselines and standard training under tight step budgets. Although full-step decoding remains superior, we substantially narrow the gap, establishing a strong foundation towards practical few-step DLLMs. The source code is available at https://github.com/Tyrion58/T3D.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose a novel simulation framework using large language model (LLM) agents in structured multi-round dialogs. Each agent's dialog history is iteratively updated with its own previously stated opinions and those of others analogous to the classical DeGroot model. Furthermore, by retaining each agent's initial opinion throughout the dialog, we simulate anchoring effects consistent with the Friedkin-Johnsen model of opinion dynamics. Our framework thus bridges classical opinion dynamics models and modern multi-agent LLM systems, providing a scalable tool for simulating and analyzing opinion formation when real-world data is limited or inaccessible.</p></details> |  |

Recent findings suggest that RLVR primarily functions by eliciting latent capabilities, motivating the development of verifier-free algorithms. However, in such settings, standard methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization face a critical challenge: destructive gradient variance that often leads to training collapse. To address this issue, we introduceVerifier-Independent Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (VI-CuRL), a framework that leverages the model's intrinsic confidence to construct a curriculum independent from external verifiers. By prioritizing high-confidence samples, VI-CuRL effectively manages the bias-variance trade-off, specifically targeting the reduction of action and problem variance. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, proving that our estimator guarantees asymptotic unbiasedness. Empirically, VI-CuRL promotes stability and consistently outperforms verifier-independent baselines across six challenging benchmarks with/without verifiers.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by peer-to-peer networks that leverage decentralized overlay nodes to increase throughput and availability, we propose GenTorrent, an LLM serving overlay that harnesses computing resources from decentralized contributors. We identify four key research problems inherent to enabling such a decentralized infrastructure: 1) overlay network organization; 2) LLM communication privacy; 3) overlay forwarding for resource efficiency; and 4) verification of serving quality. This work presents the first systematic study of these fundamental problems in the context of decentralized LLM serving. Evaluation results from a prototype implemented on a set of decentralized nodes demonstrate that GenTorrent achieves a latency reduction of over 50% compared to the baseline design without overlay forwarding. Furthermore, the security features introduce minimal overhead to serving latency and throughput. We believe this work pioneers a new direction for democratizing and scaling future AI serving capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[To Mix or To Merge: Toward Multi-Domain Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12566v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) plays a key role in stimulating the explicit reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). We can achieve expert-level performance in some specific domains via RLVR, such as coding or math. When a general multi-domain expert-level model is required, we need to carefully consider the collaboration of RLVR across different domains. The current state-of-the-art models mainly employ two different training paradigms for multi-domain RLVR: mixed multi-task RLVR and separate RLVR followed by model merging. However, most of the works did not provide a detailed comparison and analysis about these paradigms. To this end, we choose multiple commonly used high-level tasks (e.g., math, coding, science, and instruction following) as our target domains and design extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments using open-source datasets. We find the RLVR across domains exhibits few mutual interferences, and reasoning-intensive domains demonstrate mutually synergistic effects. Furthermore, we analyze the internal mechanisms of mutual gains from the perspectives of weight space geometry, model prediction behavior, and information constraints. This project is named as M2RL that means Mixed multi-task training or separate training followed by model Merging for Reinforcement Learning, and the homepage is at https://github.com/mosAI25/M2RL</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled progress in CAD program synthesis, but existing methods rely on supervised training with paired shape-program data, which is often unavailable. We introduce PLLM, a self-training framework for CAD program synthesis from unlabeled 3D shapes. Given a pre-trained CAD-capable LLM and a shape dataset, PLLM iteratively samples candidate programs, selects high-fidelity executions, and augments programs to construct synthetic program-shape pairs for fine-tuning. We experiment on adapting CAD-Recode from DeepCAD to the unlabeled ABC dataset show consistent improvements in geometric fidelity and program diversity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Outrunning LLM Cutoffs: A Live Kernel Crash Resolution Benchmark for All](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02690v2)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Repairing system crashes discovered by kernel fuzzers like Syzkaller is a critical yet underexplored challenge in software engineering. While recent works have introduced Large Language Model (LLM) based agents for Linux kernel crash-resolution, their evaluation benchmarks are usually static and thus, do not capture the evolving nature of the Linux kernel, and suffer from potential data contamination due to LLM knowledge cutoffs. To address the above problem, we present (i) Live-kBench, an evaluation framework for self-evolving benchmarks that continuously scrapes and evaluates agents on freshly discovered kernel bugs, and (ii) kEnv, an agent-agnostic standardized crash-resolution environment for kernel compilation, execution, and feedback. This design decouples agent workflows from heavy-weight execution, enabling fair and scalable comparison across diverse agent frameworks under identical conditions. To this end, we curate an inaugural dataset of 534 Linux kernel bugs and empirically demonstrate a significant performance gap, with agents achieving up to 25% higher equivalent patch rate on bugs fixed before the LLM knowledge cutoff. Using kEnv, we benchmark three state-of-the-art agents, showing that they resolve 74% of crashes on the first attempt (plausible patches); however only ~20% of generated patches closely match developer fixes. Additionally, exposing crash resolution feedback improves crash resolution rate by 29%. Live-kBench provides the community with an evaluation infrastructure for self-evolving benchmarks that is both time and attribute sensitive; complete with a public dashboard to track agent progress on Linux kernel bugs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models and Impossible Language Acquisition: "False Promise" or an Overturn of our Current Perspective towards AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08437v3)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Chomsky's provocative critique "The False Promise of CHATGPT," Large Language Models (LLMs) are characterized as mere pattern predictors that do not acquire languages via intrinsic causal and self-correction structures like humans, therefore are not able to distinguish impossible languages. It stands as a representative in a fundamental challenge to the intellectual foundations of AI, for it integrally synthesizes major issues in methodologies within LLMs and possesses an iconic a priori rationalist perspective. We examine this famous critic from both the perspective in pre-existing literature of linguistics and psychology as well as a research based on an experiment inquiring the capacity of learning both possible and impossible languages among LLMs. We constructed a set of syntactically impossible languages by applying certain transformations to English. These include reversing whole sentences, and adding negation based on word-count parity. Two rounds of controlled experiments were each conducted on GPT-2 small models and long short-term memory (LSTM) models. Statistical analysis (Welch's t-test) shows GPT2 small models underperform in learning all of the impossible languages compared to their performance on the possible language (p<.001). On the other hand, LSTM models' performance tallies with Chomsky's argument, suggesting the irreplaceable role of the evolution of transformer architecture. Based on theoretical analysis and empirical findings, we propose a new vision within Chomsky's theory towards LLMs, and a shift of theoretical paradigm outside Chomsky, from his "rationalist-romantics" paradigm to functionalism and empiricism in LLMs research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Provable Secure Steganography Based on Adaptive Dynamic Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12579v3)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The security of private communication is increasingly at risk due to widespread surveillance. Steganography, a technique for embedding secret messages within innocuous carriers, enables covert communication over monitored channels. Provably Secure Steganography (PSS), which ensures computational indistinguishability between the normal model output and steganography output, is the state-of-the-art in this field. However, current PSS methods often require obtaining the explicit distributions of the model. In this paper, we propose a provably secure steganography scheme that only requires a model API that accepts a seed as input. Our core mechanism involves sampling a candidate set of tokens and constructing a map from possible message bit strings to these tokens. The output token is selected by applying this mapping to the real secret message, which provably preserves the original model's distribution. To ensure correct decoding, we address collision cases, where multiple candidate messages map to the same token, by maintaining and strategically expanding a dynamic collision set within a bounded size range. Extensive evaluations of three real-world datasets and three large language models demonstrate that our sampling-based method is comparable with existing PSS methods in efficiency and capacity.</p></details> |  |

When interacting with a chatbot, malicious users can input specially crafted prompts that cause the LLM to generate undesirable content or perform a different task from its intended purpose. Existing systems attempt to mitigate this by hardening the LLM's system prompt or using additional classifiers to detect undesirable content or off-topic conversations. However, these probabilistic approaches are relatively easy to bypass due to the very large space of possible inputs and undesirable outputs. We present and evaluate Highlight & Summarize (H&S), a new design pattern for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that prevents these attacks by design. The core idea is to perform the same task as a standard RAG pipeline (i.e., to provide natural language answers to questions, based on relevant sources) without ever revealing the user's question to the generative LLM. This is achieved by splitting the pipeline into two components: a highlighter, which takes the user's question and extracts ("highlights") relevant passages from the retrieved documents, and a summarizer, which takes the highlighted passages and summarizes them into a cohesive answer. We describe and implement several possible instantiations of H&S and evaluate their responses in terms of correctness, relevance, and quality. For certain question-answering (QA) tasks, the responses produced by H&S are judged to be as good, if not better, than those of a standard RAG pipeline.</p></details> |  |
| **[INHerit-SG: Incremental Hierarchical Semantic Scene Graphs with RAG-Style Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12971v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Driven by advancements in foundation models, semantic scene graphs have emerged as a prominent paradigm for high-level 3D environmental abstraction in robot navigation. However, existing approaches are fundamentally misaligned with the needs of embodied tasks. As they rely on either offline batch processing or implicit feature embeddings, the maps can hardly support interpretable human-intent reasoning in complex environments. To address these limitations, we present INHerit-SG. We redefine the map as a structured, RAG-ready knowledge base where natural-language descriptions are introduced as explicit semantic anchors to better align with human intent. An asynchronous dual-process architecture, together with a Floor-Room-Area-Object hierarchy, decouples geometric segmentation from time-consuming semantic reasoning. An event-triggered map update mechanism reorganizes the graph only when meaningful semantic events occur. This strategy enables our graph to maintain long-term consistency with relatively low computational overhead. For retrieval, we deploy multi-role Large Language Models (LLMs) to decompose queries into atomic constraints and handle logical negations, and employ a hard-to-soft filtering strategy to ensure robust reasoning. This explicit interpretability improves the success rate and reliability of complex retrievals, enabling the system to adapt to a broader spectrum of human interaction tasks. We evaluate INHerit-SG on a newly constructed dataset, HM3DSem-SQR, and in real-world environments. Experiments demonstrate that our system achieves state-of-the-art performance on complex queries, and reveal its scalability for downstream navigation tasks.

We present Visual RAG Toolkit, a practical system for scaling visual multi-vector retrieval with training-free, model-aware pooling and multi-stage retrieval. Motivated by Matryoshka Embeddings, our method performs static spatial pooling - including a lightweight sliding-window averaging variant - over patch embeddings to produce compact tile-level and global representations for fast candidate generation, followed by exact MaxSim reranking using full multi-vector embeddings. Our design yields a quadratic reduction in vector-to-vector comparisons by reducing stored vectors per page from thousands to dozens, notably without requiring post-training, adapters, or distillation. Across experiments with interaction-style models such as ColPali and ColSmol-500M, we observe that over the limited ViDoRe v2 benchmark corpus 2-stage retrieval typically preserves NDCG and Recall @ 5/10 with minimal degradation, while substantially improving throughput (approximately 4x QPS); with sensitivity mainly at very large k. The toolkit additionally provides robust preprocessing - high resolution PDF to image conversion, optional margin/empty-region cropping and token hygiene (indexing only visual tokens) - and a reproducible evaluation pipeline, enabling rapid exploration of two-, three-, and cascaded retrieval variants. By emphasizing efficiency at common cutoffs (e.g., k <= 10), the toolkit lowers hardware barriers and makes state-of-the-art visual retrieval more accessible in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 3 figures.

To address this, we present AMAQA, a new open-access QA dataset designed to evaluate tasks combining text and metadata. The integration of metadata is especially important in fields that require rapid analysis of large volumes of data, such as cybersecurity and intelligence, where timely access to relevant information is critical. AMAQA includes about 1.1 million English messages collected from 26 public Telegram groups, enriched with metadata such as timestamps and chat names. It also contains 20,000 hotel reviews with metadata. In addition, the dataset provides 2,600 high-quality QA pairs built across both domains, Telegram messages and hotel reviews, making AMAQA a valuable resource for advancing research on metadata-driven QA and RAG systems. Both Telegram messages and Hotel reviews are enriched with emotional tones or toxicity indicators. To the best of our knowledge, AMAQA is the first single-hop QA benchmark to incorporate metadata. We conduct extensive tests on the benchmark, setting a new reference point for future research. We show that leveraging metadata boosts accuracy from 0.5 to 0.86 for GPT-4o and from 0.27 to 0.76 for open source LLMs, highlighting the value of structured context. We conducted experiments on our benchmark to assess the performance of known techniques designed to enhance RAG, highlighting the importance of properly managing metadata throughout the entire RAG pipeline.</p></details> |  |
| **[Campaign-2-PT-RAG: LLM-Guided Semantic Product Type Attribution for Scalable Campaign Ranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10577v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>E-commerce campaign ranking models require large-scale training labels indicating which users purchased due to campaign influence. However, generating these labels is challenging because campaigns use creative, thematic language that does not directly map to product purchases. Without clear product-level attribution, supervised learning for campaign optimization remains limited. We present \textbf{Campaign-2-PT-RAG}, a scalable label generation framework that constructs user--campaign purchase labels by inferring which product types (PTs) each campaign promotes. The framework first interprets campaign content using large language models (LLMs) to capture implicit intent, then retrieves candidate PTs through semantic search over the platform taxonomy. A structured LLM-based classifier evaluates each PT's relevance, producing a campaign-specific product coverage set. User purchases matching these PTs generate positive training labels for downstream ranking models. This approach reframes the ambiguous attribution problem into a tractable semantic alignment task, enabling scalable and consistent supervision for downstream tasks such as campaign ranking optimization in production e-commerce environments. Experiments on internal and synthetic datasets, validated against expert-annotated campaign--PT mappings, show that our LLM-assisted approach generates high-quality labels with 78--90% precision while maintaining over 99% recall.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multimodal Manufacturing Safety Chatbot: Knowledge Base Design, Benchmark Development, and Evaluation of Multiple RAG Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11847v2)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring worker safety remains a critical challenge in modern manufacturing environments. Industry 5.0 reorients the prevailing manufacturing paradigm toward more human-centric operations. Using a design science research methodology, we identify three essential requirements for next-generation safety training systems: high accuracy, low latency, and low cost. We introduce a multimodal chatbot powered by large language models that meets these design requirements. The chatbot uses retrieval-augmented generation to ground its responses in curated regulatory and technical documentation. To evaluate our solution, we developed a domain-specific benchmark of expert-validated question and answer pairs for three representative machines: a Bridgeport manual mill, a Haas TL-1 CNC lathe, and a Universal Robots UR5e collaborative robot. We tested 24 RAG configurations using a full-factorial design and assessed them with automated evaluations of correctness, latency, and cost. Our top 2 configurations were then evaluated by ten industry experts and academic researchers. Our results show that retrieval strategy and model configuration have a significant impact on performance. The top configuration, selected for chatbot deployment, achieved an accuracy of 86.66%, an average cost of $0.005 per query, and an average end-to-end latency of 10.04 seconds. This latency is practical for delivering a complete safety instruction and is measured from query submission to full instruction delivery rather than generation onset. Overall, our work provides three contributions: an open-source, domain-grounded safety training chatbot; a validated benchmark for evaluating AI-assisted safety instruction; and a systematic methodology for designing and assessing AI-enabled instructional and immersive safety training systems for Industry 5.0 environments.</p></details> | 25 pages, 5 figures |

We show that this composition introduces a distinct security failure mode: a vector-retrieved "seed" chunk can pivot via entity links into sensitive graph neighborhoods, causing cross-tenant data leakage that does not occur in vector-only retrieval. We formalize this risk as Retrieval Pivot Risk (RPR) and introduce companion metrics Leakage@k, Amplification Factor, and Pivot Depth (PD) to quantify leakage magnitude and traversal structure. We present seven Retrieval Pivot Attacks that exploit the vector-to-graph boundary and show that adversarial injection is not required: naturally shared entities create cross-tenant pivot paths organically. Across a synthetic multi-tenant enterprise corpus and the Enron email corpus, the undefended hybrid pipeline exhibits high pivot risk (RPR up to 0.95) with multiple unauthorized items returned per query. Leakage consistently appears at PD=2, which we attribute to the bipartite chunk-entity topology and formalize as a proposition. We then show that enforcing authorization at a single location, the graph expansion boundary, eliminates measured leakage (RPR near 0) across both corpora, all attack variants, and label forgery rates up to 10 percent, with minimal overhead. Our results indicate the root cause is boundary enforcement, not inherently complex defenses: two individually secure retrieval components can compose into an insecure system unless authorization is re-checked at the transition point.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Comprehensive Comparison of RAG Methods Across Multi-Domain Conversational QA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09552v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conversational question answering increasingly relies on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground large language models (LLMs) in external knowledge. Yet, most existing studies evaluate RAG methods in isolation and primarily focus on single-turn settings. This paper addresses the lack of a systematic comparison of RAG methods for multi-turn conversational QA, where dialogue history, coreference, and shifting user intent substantially complicate retrieval. We present a comprehensive empirical study of vanilla and advanced RAG methods across eight diverse conversational QA datasets spanning multiple domains. Using a unified experimental setup, we evaluate retrieval quality and answer generation using generator and retrieval metrics, and analyze how performance evolves across conversation turns. Our results show that robust yet straightforward methods, such as reranking, hybrid BM25, and HyDE, consistently outperform vanilla RAG. In contrast, several advanced techniques fail to yield gains and can even degrade performance below the No-RAG baseline. We further demonstrate that dataset characteristics and dialogue length strongly influence retrieval effectiveness, explaining why no single RAG strategy dominates across settings. Overall, our findings indicate that effective conversational RAG depends less on method complexity than on alignment between the retrieval strategy and the dataset structure. We publish the code used.\footnote{\href{https://github.com/Klejda-A/exp-rag.git}{GitHub Repository}}</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EACL SRW 26</p></details> |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures, which retrieve external knowledge sources to enhance the generative capabilities of LLMs, remain susceptible to the same bias-related challenges. This work focuses on evaluating and understanding the social bias implications of RAG. Through extensive experiments across various retrieval corpora, LLMs, and bias evaluation datasets, encompassing more than 13 different bias types, we surprisingly observe a reduction in bias in RAG. This suggests that the inclusion of external context can help counteract stereotype-driven predictions, potentially improving fairness by diversifying the contextual grounding of the model's outputs. To better understand this phenomenon, we then explore the model's reasoning process by integrating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting into RAG while assessing the faithfulness of the model's CoT. Our experiments reveal that the model's bias inclinations shift between stereotype and anti-stereotype responses as more contextual information is incorporated from the retrieved documents. Interestingly, we find that while CoT enhances accuracy, contrary to the bias reduction observed with RAG, it increases overall bias across datasets, highlighting the need for bias-aware reasoning frameworks that can mitigate this trade-off.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a full paper with an oral presentation at the 30th Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (PAKDD 2026)</p></details> |

In Chinese Tibetan medicine, encyclopedia entries are often dense and easy to match, which can dominate retrieval even when classics or clinical papers provide more authoritative evidence. We study a practical setting with three KBs (encyclopedia, classics, and clinical papers) and a 500-query benchmark (cutoff $K{=}5$) covering both single-KB and cross-KB questions. We propose two complementary methods to improve traceability, reduce hallucinations, and enable cross-KB verification. First, DAKS performs KB routing and budgeted retrieval to mitigate density-driven bias and to prioritize authoritative sources when appropriate. Second, we use an alignment graph to guide evidence fusion and coverage-aware packing, improving cross-KB evidence coverage without relying on naive concatenation. All answers are generated by a lightweight generator, \textsc{openPangu-Embedded-7B}. Experiments show consistent gains in routing quality and cross-KB evidence coverage, with the full system achieving the best CrossEv@5 while maintaining strong faithfulness and citation correctness.</p></details> |  |

It features recent reference datasets, a question generation framework, an automatic evaluation pipeline, and a public leaderboard. Specified reference datasets allow for uniform comparison of RAG systems, while newly generated dataset versions mitigate data leakage and ensure that all models are evaluated on unseen, comparable data. The pipeline for automatic question generation extracts the Knowledge Graph from the text corpus and produces multiple question-answer pairs utilizing modern LLM capabilities. A set of diverse LLM-as-Judge metrics is provided for a comprehensive model evaluation. We used Russian news outlets to form the datasets and demonstrate our methodology. We launch a public leaderboard to track the development of RAG systems and encourage community participation.</p></details> | EACL 2026 |

From a technical perspective, this integration represents retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which enhances LLMs by grounding them in external knowledge bases. A prevalent technical approach in this context is graph-based RAG (G-RAG). However, current G-RAG methodologies frequently underutilize graph topology, predominantly focusing on low-order structures or pre-computed static communities. This limitation affects their effectiveness in addressing dynamic and complex queries. Thus, we propose DA-RAG, which leverages attributed community search (ACS) to extract relevant subgraphs based on the queried question dynamically. DA-RAG captures high-order graph structures, allowing for the retrieval of self-complementary knowledge. Furthermore, DA-RAG is equipped with a chunk-layer oriented graph index, which facilitates efficient multi-granularity retrieval while significantly reducing both computational and economic costs. We evaluate DA-RAG on multiple datasets, demonstrating that it outperforms existing RAG methods by up to 40% in head-to-head comparisons across four metrics while reducing index construction time and token overhead by up to 37% and 41%, respectively.</p></details> |  |

In distributed and access-restricted settings (e.g., hospitals or multinational organizations), retrieval must select relevant domains and appropriate traversal depth without global graph visibility or exhaustive querying. To address this challenge, we introduce \textbf{SCOUT-RAG} (\textit{\underline{S}calable and \underline{CO}st-efficient \underline{U}nifying \underline{T}raversal}), a distributed agentic Graph-RAG framework that performs progressive cross-domain retrieval guided by incremental utility goals. SCOUT-RAG employs four cooperative agents that: (i) estimate domain relevance, (ii) decide when to expand retrieval to additional domains, (iii) adapt traversal depth to avoid unnecessary graph exploration, and (iv) synthesize the high-quality answers. The framework is designed to minimize retrieval regret, defined as missing useful domain information, while controlling latency and API cost. Across multi-domain knowledge settings, SCOUT-RAG achieves performance comparable to centralized baselines, including DRIFT and exhaustive domain traversal, while substantially reducing cross-domain calls, total tokens processed, and latency.</p></details> |  |

Traditional information systems struggle with the fragmented, multimodal nature of disaster data and lack adaptive reasoning capabilities essential for dynamic emergency contexts. This work introduces RAPTOR-AI, an agentic multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that advances beyond conventional static knowledge bases by implementing dynamic, experience-driven decision support for disaster response. The system addresses HADR requirements across initial rescue, recovery, and reconstruction phases through three key innovations: hierarchical multimodal knowledge construction from diverse sources (textual reports, aerial imagery, historical documentation), entropy-aware agentic control that dynamically selects optimal retrieval strategies based on situational context, and experiential knowledge integration using LoRA adaptation for both expert and non-expert responders. The framework constructs hierarchical knowledge trees from 46 tsunami-related PDFs (2,378 pages) using BLIP-based image understanding, ColVBERT embeddings, and long-context summarization within the OODA loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) tactical framework. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over existing approaches: 23\% improvement in retrieval precision, 31\% better situational grounding, and 27\% enhanced task decomposition accuracy, with efficient scaling up to 3,000 document chunks.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Various RAG paradigms - including vanilla, planning-based, and iterative RAG - all depend on a robust retriever, yet existing retrievers rely heavily on public knowledge and often falter when faced with domain-specific queries. To address these limitations, we introduce DRAGON, a framework that combines a data-construction modeling approach with a scalable synthetic data-generation pipeline, specifically designed to optimize domain-specific retrieval performance and bolster retriever robustness. To evaluate RAG performance on domain-specific RAGs, we propose DRAGONBench, a benchmark spanning 8 domain-specific document collections across 4 distinct fields and featuring a wide spectrum of query complexities, answerability, and hop numbers. Leveraging DRAGON, we generate a large-scale synthetic dataset - encompassing both single-hop and multi-hop queries - to enrich retriever training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that retrievers trained on this data yield significant performance gains and exhibit strong cross-domain generalization. Moreover, when our optimized retrievers are integrated into vanilla, planning-based, and iterative RAG paradigms, we observe consistent end-to-end improvements in system accuracy.</p></details> |  |

RAG system stores documents as embedding vectors in a database. Given a query, search is executed to find the most related documents. Then, the topmost matching documents are inserted into LLMs' prompt to generate a response. Efficient and accurate searching is critical for RAG to get relevant information. We propose a cost-effective searching algorithm for retrieval process. Our progressive searching algorithm incrementally refines the candidate set through a hierarchy of searches, starting from low-dimensional embeddings and progressing into a higher, target-dimensionality. This multi-stage approach reduces retrieval time while preserving the desired accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that progressive search in RAG systems achieves a balance between dimensionality, speed, and accuracy, enabling scalable and high-performance retrieval even for large databases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Spreading Activation for Improved Document Retrieval in Knowledge-Graph-Based RAG Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15922v2)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite initial successes and a variety of architectures, retrieval-augmented generation systems still struggle to reliably retrieve and connect the multi-step evidence required for complicated reasoning tasks. Most of the standard RAG frameworks regard all retrieved information as equally reliable, overlooking the varying credibility and interconnected nature of large textual corpora. GraphRAG approaches offer potential improvement to RAG systems by integrating knowledge graphs, which structure information into nodes and edges, capture entity relationships, and enable multi-step logical traversal. However, GraphRAG is not always an ideal solution, as it depends on high-quality graph representations of the corpus. Such representations usually rely on manually curated knowledge graphs, which are costly to construct and update, or on automated graph-construction pipelines that are often unreliable. Moreover, systems following this paradigm typically use large language models to guide graph traversal and evidence retrieval. In this paper, we propose a novel RAG framework that uses a spreading activation algorithm to retrieve information from a corpus of documents connected by an automatically constructed heterogeneous knowledge graph. This approach reduces reliance on semantic knowledge graphs, which are often incomplete due to information loss during information extraction, avoids LLM-guided graph traversal, and improves performance on multi-hop question answering. Experiments show that our method achieves better or comparable performance to several state-of-the-art RAG methods and can be integrated as a plug-and-play module with different iterative RAG pipelines. When combined with chain-of-thought iterative retrieval, it yields up to a 39% absolute improvement in answer correctness over naive RAG, while achieving these results with small open-weight language models.</p></details> | 20 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Confundo: Learning to Generate Robust Poison for Practical RAG Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06616v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is increasingly deployed in real-world applications, where its reference-grounded design makes outputs appear trustworthy. This trust has spurred research on poisoning attacks that craft malicious content, inject it into knowledge sources, and manipulate RAG responses. However, when evaluated in practical RAG systems, existing attacks suffer from severely degraded effectiveness. This gap stems from two overlooked realities: (i) content is often processed before use, which can fragment the poison and weaken its effect, and (ii) users often do not issue the exact queries anticipated during attack design. These factors can lead practitioners to underestimate risks and develop a false sense of security. To better characterize the threat to practical systems, we present Confundo, a learning-to-poison framework that fine-tunes a large language model as a poison generator to achieve high effectiveness, robustness, and stealthiness. Confundo provides a unified framework supporting multiple attack objectives, demonstrated by manipulating factual correctness, inducing biased opinions, and triggering hallucinations. By addressing these overlooked challenges, Confundo consistently outperforms a wide range of purpose-built attacks across datasets and RAG configurations by large margins, even in the presence of defenses. Beyond exposing vulnerabilities, we also present a defensive use case that protects web content from unauthorized incorporation into RAG systems via scraping, with no impact on user experience.</p></details> |  |
| **[Subgraph Reconstruction Attacks on Graph RAG Deployments with Practical Defenses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06495v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (Graph RAG) is increasingly deployed to support LLM applications by augmenting user queries with structured knowledge retrieved from a knowledge graph. While Graph RAG improves relational reasoning, it introduces a largely understudied threat: adversaries can reconstruct subgraphs from a target RAG system's knowledge graph, enabling privacy inference and replication of curated knowledge assets. We show that existing attacks are largely ineffective against Graph RAG even with simple prompt-based safeguards, because these attacks expose explicit exfiltration intent and are therefore easily suppressed by lightweight safe prompts. We identify three technical challenges for practical Graph RAG extraction under realistic safeguards and introduce GRASP, a closed-box, multi-turn subgraph reconstruction attack. GRASP (i) reframes extraction as a context-processing task, (ii) enforces format-compliant, instance-grounded outputs via per-record identifiers to reduce hallucinations and preserve relational details, and (iii) diversifies goal-driven attack queries using a momentum-aware scheduler to operate within strict query budgets. Across two real-world knowledge graphs, four safety-aligned LLMs, and multiple Graph RAG frameworks, GRASP attains the strongest type-faithful reconstruction where prior methods fail, reaching up to 82.9 F1. We further evaluate defenses and propose two lightweight mitigations that substantially reduce reconstruction fidelity without utility loss.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Iterative RAG Beats Ideal Evidence: A Diagnostic Study in Scientific Multi-hop Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19827v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) extends large language models (LLMs) beyond parametric knowledge, yet it is unclear when iterative retrieval-reasoning loops meaningfully outperform static RAG, particularly in scientific domains with multi-hop reasoning, sparse domain knowledge, and heterogeneous evidence. We provide the first controlled, mechanism-level diagnostic study of whether synchronized iterative retrieval and reasoning can surpass an idealized static upper bound (Gold Context) RAG. We benchmark eleven state-of-the-art LLMs under three regimes: (i) No Context, measuring reliance on parametric memory; (ii) Gold Context, where all oracle evidence is supplied at once; and (iii) Iterative RAG, a training-free controller that alternates retrieval, hypothesis refinement, and evidence-aware stopping. Using the chemistry-focused ChemKGMultiHopQA dataset, we isolate questions requiring genuine retrieval and analyze behavior with diagnostics spanning retrieval coverage gaps, anchor-carry drop, query quality, composition fidelity, and control calibration. Across models, Iterative RAG consistently outperforms Gold Context, with gains up to 25.6 percentage points, especially for non-reasoning fine-tuned models. Staged retrieval reduces late-hop failures, mitigates context overload, and enables dynamic correction of early hypothesis drift, but remaining failure modes include incomplete hop coverage, distractor latch trajectories, early stopping miscalibration, and high composition failure rates even with perfect retrieval. Overall, staged retrieval is often more influential than the mere presence of ideal evidence; we provide practical guidance for deploying and diagnosing RAG systems in specialized scientific settings and a foundation for more reliable, controllable iterative retrieval-reasoning frameworks.</p></details> | 27 pages, 15 figures |

To address this limitation, we introduce CE-RAG4EM, a cost-efficient RAG architecture that reduces computation through blocking-based batch retrieval and generation. We also present a unified framework for analyzing and evaluating RAG systems for entity matching, focusing on blocking-aware optimizations and retrieval granularity. Extensive experiments suggest that CE-RAG4EM can achieve comparable or improved matching quality while substantially reducing end-to-end runtime relative to strong baselines. Our analysis further reveals that key configuration parameters introduce an inherent trade-off between performance and overhead, offering practical guidance for designing efficient and scalable RAG systems for entity matching and data integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Addressing Corpus Knowledge Poisoning Attacks on RAG Using Sparse Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04711v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a highly effective paradigm for keeping LLM-based responses up-to-date and reducing the likelihood of hallucinations. Yet, RAG was recently shown to be quite vulnerable to corpus knowledge poisoning: an attacker injects misleading documents to the corpus to steer an LLM's output to an undesired response. We argue that the standard causal attention mechanism in LLMs enables harmful cross-document interactions, specifically in cases of attacks. Accordingly, we introduce a novel defense approach for RAG: Sparse Document Attention RAG (SDAG). This is a block-sparse attention mechanism that disallows cross-attention between retrieved documents. SDAG requires a minimal inference-time change to the attention mask; furthermore, no fine-tuning or additional architectural changes are needed. We present an empirical evaluation of LLM-based question answering (QA) with a variety of attack strategies on RAG. We show that our SDAG method substantially outperforms the standard causal attention mechanism in terms of attack success rate. We further demonstrate the clear merits of integrating SDAG with state-of-the-art RAG defense methods. Specifically, the integration results in performance that is statistically significantly better than the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAG without Forgetting: Continual Query-Infused Key Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05152v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems commonly improve robustness via query-time adaptations such as query expansion and iterative retrieval. While effective, these approaches are inherently stateless: adaptations are recomputed for each query and discarded thereafter, precluding cumulative learning and repeatedly incurring inference-time cost. Index-side approaches like key expansion introduce persistence but rely on offline preprocessing or heuristic updates that are weakly aligned with downstream task utility, leading to semantic drift and noise accumulation. We propose Evolving Retrieval Memory (ERM), a training-free framework that transforms transient query-time gains into persistent retrieval improvements. ERM updates the retrieval index through correctness-gated feedback, selectively attributes atomic expansion signals to the document keys they benefit, and progressively evolves keys via stable, norm-bounded updates. We show that query and key expansion are theoretically equivalent under standard similarity functions and prove convergence of ERM's selective updates, amortizing optimal query expansion into a stable index with zero inference-time overhead. Experiments on BEIR and BRIGHT across 13 domains demonstrate consistent gains in retrieval and generation, particularly on reasoning-intensive tasks, at native retrieval speed.</p></details> | 24 pages, 12 figures |
| **[HugRAG: Hierarchical Causal Knowledge Graph Design for RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05143v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has enhanced large language models by enabling access to external knowledge, with graph-based RAG emerging as a powerful paradigm for structured retrieval and reasoning. However, existing graph-based methods often over-rely on surface-level node matching and lack explicit causal modeling, leading to unfaithful or spurious answers. Prior attempts to incorporate causality are typically limited to local or single-document contexts and also suffer from information isolation that arises from modular graph structures, which hinders scalability and cross-module causal reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose HugRAG, a framework that rethinks knowledge organization for graph-based RAG through causal gating across hierarchical modules. HugRAG explicitly models causal relationships to suppress spurious correlations while enabling scalable reasoning over large-scale knowledge graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HugRAG consistently outperforms competitive graph-based RAG baselines across multiple datasets and evaluation metrics. Our work establishes a principled foundation for structured, scalable, and causally grounded RAG systems.</p></details> |  |

SAR is a remote sensing method used in defense and security applications to detect and monitor the positions of military vehicles, which may appear indistinguishable in images. Researchers have extensively studied SAR ATR to improve the differentiation and identification of vehicle types, characteristics, and measurements. Test examples can be compared with known vehicle target types to improve recognition tasks. New methods enhance the capabilities of neural networks, transformer attention, and multimodal large language models. An agentic AI method may be developed to utilize a defined set of tools, such as searching through a library of similar examples. Our proposed method, SAR Retrieval-Augmented Generation (SAR-RAG), combines a multimodal large language model (MLLM) with a vector database of semantic embeddings to support contextual search for image exemplars with known qualities. By recovering past image examples with known true target types, our SAR-RAG system can compare similar vehicle categories, achieving improved ATR prediction accuracy. We evaluate this through search and retrieval metrics, categorical classification accuracy, and numeric regression of vehicle dimensions. These metrics all show improvements when SAR-RAG is added to an MLLM baseline method as an attached ATR memory bank.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to 2026 IEEE Radar Conference</p></details> |

We present \textbf{Atomic Information Flow (AIF)}, a graph-based network flow model that decomposes tool outputs and LLM calls into atoms: indivisible, self-contained units of information. By modeling LLM orchestration as a directed flow of atoms from tool and LLM nodes to a response super-sink, AIF enables granular attribution metrics for AI explainability. Motivated by the max-flow min-cut theorem in network flow theory, we train a lightweight Gemma3 (4B parameter) language model as a context compressor to approximate the minimum cut of tool atoms using flow signals computed offline by AIF. We note that the base Gemma3-4B model struggles to identify critical information with \textbf{54.7\%} accuracy on HotpotQA, barely outperforming lexical baselines (BM25). However, post-training on AIF signals boosts accuracy to \textbf{82.71\%} (+28.01 points) while achieving \textbf{87.52\%} (+1.85\%) context token compression -- bridging the gap with the Gemma3-27B variant, a model nearly $7\times$ larger.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Fine-Tuning for History-Aware Dense Retriever in RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03645v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to produce evidence-based responses, and its performance hinges on the matching between the retriever and LLMs. Retriever optimization has emerged as an efficient alternative to fine-tuning LLMs. However, existing solutions suffer from objective mismatch between retriever optimization and the goal of RAG pipeline. Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a promising solution to address this limitation, yet applying RL to retriever optimization introduces two fundamental challenges: 1) the deterministic retrieval is incompatible with RL formulations, and 2) state aliasing arises from query-only retrieval in multi-hop reasoning. To address these challenges, we replace deterministic retrieval with stochastic sampling and formulate RAG as a Markov decision process, making retriever optimizable by RL. Further, we incorporate retrieval history into the state at each retrieval step to mitigate state aliasing. Extensive experiments across diverse RAG pipelines, datasets, and retriever scales demonstrate consistent improvements of our approach in RAG performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>On go...</summary><p>On going work.

However, existing RAG systems fail to leverage these capabilities. They still rely on two paradigms: (1) designing an algorithm that retrieves passages in a single shot and concatenates them into the model's input, or (2) predefining a workflow and prompting the model to execute it step-by-step. Neither paradigm allows the model to participate in retrieval decisions, preventing efficient scaling with model improvements. In this paper, we introduce A-RAG, an Agentic RAG framework that exposes hierarchical retrieval interfaces directly to the model. A-RAG provides three retrieval tools: keyword search, semantic search, and chunk read, enabling the agent to adaptively search and retrieve information across multiple granularities. Experiments on multiple open-domain QA benchmarks show that A-RAG consistently outperforms existing approaches with comparable or lower retrieved tokens, demonstrating that A-RAG effectively leverages model capabilities and dynamically adapts to different RAG tasks. We further systematically study how A-RAG scales with model size and test-time compute. We will release our code and evaluation suite to facilitate future research.

Yet, RAG-based LLMs still hallucinate even when provided with correct and sufficient context. A growing line of work suggests that this stems from an imbalance between how models use external context and their internal knowledge, and several approaches have attempted to quantify these signals for hallucination detection. However, existing methods require extensive hyperparameter tuning, limiting their generalizability. We propose LUMINA, a novel framework that detects hallucinations in RAG systems through context--knowledge signals: external context utilization is quantified via distributional distance, while internal knowledge utilization is measured by tracking how predicted tokens evolve across transformer layers. We further introduce a framework for statistically validating these measurements. Experiments on common RAG hallucination benchmarks and four open-source LLMs show that LUMINA achieves consistently high AUROC and AUPRC scores, outperforming prior utilization-based methods by up to +13% AUROC on HalluRAG. Moreover, LUMINA remains robust under relaxed assumptions about retrieval quality and model matching, offering both effectiveness and practicality.

In the Algerian context, this is complicated by the linguistic complexity of Darja, a dialect characterized by non-standardized orthography, extensive code-switching with French, and the simultaneous use of Arabic and Latin (Arabizi) scripts. This paper introduces DziriBOT, a hybrid intelligent conversational agent specifically engineered to overcome these challenges. We propose a multi-layered architecture that integrates specialized Natural Language Understanding (NLU) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), allowing for both structured service flows and dynamic, knowledge-intensive responses grounded in curated enterprise documentation. To address the low-resource nature of Darja, we systematically evaluate three distinct approaches: a sparse-feature Rasa pipeline, classical machine learning baselines, and transformer-based fine-tuning. Our experimental results demonstrate that the fine-tuned DziriBERT model achieves state-of-the-art performance. These results significantly outperform traditional baselines, particularly in handling orthographic noise and rare intents. Ultimately, DziriBOT provides a robust, scalable solution that bridges the gap between formal language models and the linguistic realities of Algerian users, offering a blueprint for dialect-aware automation in the regional market.</p></details> |  |

These issues are amplified for low-resource languages, where high-quality domain documentation exists but remains difficult to access through general-purpose models. This paper presents AgriHubi, a domain-adapted retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system for Finnish-language agricultural decision support. AgriHubi integrates Finnish agricultural documents with open PORO family models and combines explicit source grounding with user feedback to support iterative refinement. Developed over eight iterations and evaluated through two user studies, the system shows clear gains in answer completeness, linguistic accuracy, and perceived reliability. The results also reveal practical trade-offs between response quality and latency when deploying larger models.

RAG targets large, heterogeneous corpora where retrieved passages are diverse, whereas agent memory is a bounded, coherent dialogue stream with highly correlated spans that are often duplicates. Under this shift, fixed top-$k$ similarity retrieval tends to return redundant context, and post-hoc pruning can delete temporally linked prerequisites needed for correct reasoning. We argue retrieval should move beyond similarity matching and instead operate over latent components, following decoupling to aggregation: disentangle memories into semantic components, organise them into a hierarchy, and use this structure to drive retrieval. We propose xMemory, which builds a hierarchy of intact units and maintains a searchable yet faithful high-level node organisation via a sparsity--semantics objective that guides memory split and merge. At inference, xMemory retrieves top-down, selecting a compact, diverse set of themes and semantics for multi-fact queries, and expanding to episodes and raw messages only when it reduces the reader's uncertainty. Experiments on LoCoMo and PerLTQA across the three latest LLMs show consistent gains in answer quality and token efficiency.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a Tree-RAG acceleration method based on the improved Cuckoo Filter, which optimizes entity localization during the retrieval process to achieve significant performance improvements. Tree-RAG effectively organizes entities through the introduction of a hierarchical tree structure, while the Cuckoo Filter serves as an efficient data structure that supports rapid membership queries and dynamic updates. The experiment results demonstrate that our method is much faster than naive Tree-RAG while maintaining high levels of generative quality. When the number of trees is large, our method is hundreds of times faster than naive Tree-RAG. Our work is available at https://github.com/TUPYP7180/CFT-RAG-2025.</p></details> |  |

While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a solution, current systems often rely on static workflows that miss the iterative, hypothetico-deductive reasoning of clinicians. To address this, we introduce Deep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end via reinforcement learning (RL) for traceable diagnostic reasoning. Deep-DxSearch acts as an active investigator, treating the LLM as an agent within an environment of 16,000+ guideline-derived disease profiles, 150,000+ patient records for case-based reasoning, and over 27 million biomedical documents. Using soft verifiable rewards that co-optimize retrieval and reasoning, the model learns to formulate queries, evaluate evidence, and refine searches to close diagnostic gaps. Experiments show our end-to-end RL framework consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG methods. On in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks for common and rare diseases, Deep-DxSearch surpasses strong baselines-including GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and medical-specific frameworks-achieving an average accuracy gain of 22.7% over the second-best model. In validation with 150 real-world cases, Deep-DxSearch boosts physicians' average diagnostic accuracy from 45.6% to 69.1%. These results indicate that evolving agentic systems to leverage statistical regularities in large-scale healthcare data is key for trustworthy diagnostic assistants.

We present a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) embedding framework that integrates graph neural network representations with dynamically retrieved literature-derived knowledge through contrastive learning. Benchmarking against ten embedding methods reveals task-specific complementarity: topology-focused methods achieve near-perfect link prediction (GCN: 0.983 AUROC), while RAG-GNN is the only method achieving positive silhouette scores for functional clustering (0.001 vs. negative scores for all baselines). Information-theoretic decomposition shows network topology contributes 77.3% of predictive information, while retrieved documents provide 8.6% unique information. Applied to cancer signaling networks (379 proteins, 3,498 interactions), the framework identifies DDR1 as a therapeutic target based on retrieved evidence of synthetic lethality with KRAS mutations. These results establish that topology-only and retrieval-augmented approaches serve complementary purposes: structural prediction tasks are solved by network topology alone, while functional interpretation uniquely benefits from retrieved knowledge.</p></details> |  |
| **[When RAG Hurts: Diagnosing and Mitigating Attention Distraction in Retrieval-Augmented LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00344v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is one of the dominant paradigms for enhancing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) on knowledge-based VQA tasks, recent work attributes RAG failures to insufficient attention towards the retrieved context, proposing to reduce the attention allocated to image tokens. In this work, we identify a distinct failure mode that previous study overlooked: Attention Distraction (AD). When the retrieved context is sufficient (highly relevant or including the correct answer), the retrieved text suppresses the visual attention globally, and the attention on image tokens shifts away from question-relevant regions. This leads to failures on questions the model could originally answer correctly without the retrieved text. To mitigate this issue, we propose MAD-RAG, a training-free intervention that decouples visual grounding from context integration through a dual-question formulation, combined with attention mixing to preserve image-conditioned evidence. Extensive experiments on OK-VQA, E-VQA, and InfoSeek demonstrate that MAD-RAG consistently outperforms existing baselines across different model families, yielding absolute gains of up to 4.76%, 9.20%, and 6.18% over the vanilla RAG baseline. Notably, MAD-RAG rectifies up to 74.68% of failure cases with negligible computational overhead.</p></details> | 18 pages, 10 figures |

Despite extensive efforts exploring diverse retrieval strategies, existing studies predominantly focus on query-side complexity or isolated method improvements, lacking a systematic understanding of how RAG paradigms behave across different query-corpus contexts and effectiveness-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce RAGRouter-Bench, the first dataset and benchmark designed for adaptive RAG routing. RAGRouter-Bench revisits retrieval from a query-corpus compatibility perspective and standardizes five representative RAG paradigms for systematic evaluation across 7,727 queries and 21,460 documents spanning diverse domains. The benchmark incorporates three canonical query types together with fine-grained semantic and structural corpus metrics, as well as a unified evaluation for both generation quality and resource consumption. Experiments with DeepSeek-V3 and LLaMA-3.1-8B demonstrate that no single RAG paradigm is universally optimal, that paradigm applicability is strongly shaped by query-corpus interactions, and that increased advanced mechanism does not necessarily yield better effectiveness-efficiency trade-offs. These findings underscore the necessity of routing-aware evaluation and establish a foundation for adaptive, interpretable, and generalizable next-generation RAG systems.</p></details> |  |

This overlooks common information-seeking scenarios with multiple plausible answers, where diversity is essential to avoid collapsing to a single dominant response, thereby constraining creativity and compromising fair and inclusive information access. Our analysis reveals a commonly overlooked limitation of standard RAG systems: they underutilize retrieved context diversity, such that increasing retrieval diversity alone does not yield diverse generations. To address this limitation, we propose DIVERGE, a plug-and-play agentic RAG framework with novel reflection-guided generation and memory-augmented iterative refinement, which promotes diverse viewpoints while preserving answer quality. We introduce novel metrics tailored to evaluating the diversity-quality trade-off in open-ended questions, and show that they correlate well with human judgments. We demonstrate that DIVERGE achieves the best diversity-quality trade-off compared to competitive baselines and previous state-of-the-art methods on the real-world Infinity-Chat dataset, substantially improving diversity while maintaining quality. More broadly, our results reveal a systematic limitation of current LLM-based systems for open-ended information-seeking and show that explicitly modeling diversity can mitigate it.

We introduce a novel training framework that treats the RAG pipeline as an interactive proof system by adapting the Merlin-Arthur (M/A) protocol: Arthur (the generator LLM) trains on questions with unknown context provenance and Merlin gives helpful evidence, while Morgana injects adversarial, misleading context. Both use an XAI method to identify and modify evidence most influential to Arthur. This trains Arthur to (1) answer when evidence supports the answer, (2) reject when evidence is insufficient, and (3) rely on the context spans that truly ground the answer. We further introduce a verification framework that disentangles explanation fidelity from model predictive errors, and introduce the Explained Information Fraction (EIF), which normalizes M/A mutual-information guarantees. Across three RAG datasets and multiple LLM families and sizes, M/A training makes LLMs more grounded in evidence, increases information theoretic measures (soundness, completeness) and reject behavior with less hallucinations, without manually annotated unanswerable samples. Finally, the retriever also improves recall and MRR via automatically generated M/A hard positives and negatives. While high accuracy does not guarantee entropy flow from context to answer, our EIF results show that autonomous interactive-proof-style supervision enables RAG systems that treat retrieved documents as verifiable evidence. % rather than suggestions.</p></details> | 31 pages, 22 figures |
| **[JADE: Bridging the Strategic-Operational Gap in Dynamic Agentic RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21916v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shifted from static retrieval pipelines to dynamic, agentic workflows where a central planner orchestrates multi-turn reasoning. However, existing paradigms face a critical dichotomy: they either optimize modules jointly within rigid, fixed-graph architectures, or empower dynamic planning while treating executors as frozen, black-box tools. We identify that this \textit{decoupled optimization} creates a ``strategic-operational mismatch,'' where sophisticated planning strategies fail to materialize due to unadapted local executors, often leading to negative performance gains despite increased system complexity. In this paper, we propose \textbf{JADE} (\textbf{J}oint \textbf{A}gentic \textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{E}xecution), a unified framework for the joint optimization of planning and execution within dynamic, multi-turn workflows. By modeling the system as a cooperative multi-agent team unified under a single shared backbone, JADE enables end-to-end learning driven by outcome-based rewards. This approach facilitates \textit{co-adaptation}: the planner learns to operate within the capability boundaries of the executors, while the executors evolve to align with high-level strategic intent. Empirical results demonstrate that JADE transforms disjoint modules into a synergistic system, yielding remarkable performance improvements via joint optimization and enabling a flexible balance between efficiency and effectiveness through dynamic workflow orchestration.</p></details> |  |

However, the opacity of how these components interact creates challenges for deployment in high-stakes domains. We present RAG-E, an end-to-end explainability framework that quantifies retriever-generator alignment through mathematically grounded attribution methods. Our approach adapts Integrated Gradients for retriever analysis, introduces PMCSHAP, a Monte Carlo-stabilized Shapley Value approximation, for generator attribution, and introduces the Weighted Attribution-Relevance Gap (WARG) metric to measure how well a generator's document usage aligns with a retriever's ranking. Empirical analysis on TREC CAsT and FoodSafeSum reveals critical misalignments: for 47.4% to 66.7% of queries, generators ignore the retriever's top-ranked documents, while 48.1% to 65.9% rely on documents ranked as less relevant. These failure modes demonstrate that RAG output quality depends not solely on individual component performance but on their interplay, which can be audited via RAG-E.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Transparent RAG: Fostering Evidence Traceability in LLM Generation via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13258v3)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) delivers substantial value in knowledge-intensive applications. However, its generated responses often lack transparent reasoning paths that trace back to source evidence from retrieved documents. This opacity not only compromises the interpretability of the output but also limits the model's ability to fully exploit the provided context. To address this, we propose TRACE (Transparent RAG with evidenCE tracing), a framework designed to enhance evidence traceability in Large Language Models (LLMs) through reinforcement learning (RL). TRACE guides LLMs to produce structured outputs with explicit evidence citations by prompting and rewarding evidence relevance and proper formatting, alongside accuracy, to optimize structured traceability. To ensure training stability with multiple reward signals, we further introduce an adaptive strategy for merging rewards and adopt a stabilized KL-divergence estimator. Experiments on three multi-hop QA datasets using Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct show that TRACE achieves both transparent, evidence-attributed outputs and accuracy improvements of 10-30%. The resulting performance is comparable to advanced commercial LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o1, DeepSeek-R1). Further analyses demonstrate strong generalization capabilities to unseen tasks. Our code is publicly available now.</p></details> |  |

However, long-horizon EHRs often exceed LLM context limits, and existing approaches commonly rely on truncation or vanilla retrieval strategies that discard clinically relevant events and temporal dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose EHR-RAG, a retrieval-augmented framework designed for accurate interpretation of long-horizon structured EHR data. EHR-RAG introduces three components tailored to longitudinal clinical prediction tasks: Event- and Time-Aware Hybrid EHR Retrieval to preserve clinical structure and temporal dynamics, Adaptive Iterative Retrieval to progressively refine queries in order to expand broad evidence coverage, and Dual-Path Evidence Retrieval and Reasoning to jointly retrieves and reasons over both factual and counterfactual evidence. Experiments across four long-horizon EHR prediction tasks show that EHR-RAG consistently outperforms the strongest LLM-based baselines, achieving an average Macro-F1 improvement of 10.76%. Overall, our work highlights the potential of retrieval-augmented LLMs to advance clinical prediction on structured EHR data in practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[User-Centric Phishing Detection: A RAG and LLM-Based Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21261v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The escalating sophistication of phishing emails necessitates a shift beyond traditional rule-based and conventional machine-learning-based detectors. Although large language models (LLMs) offer strong natural language understanding, using them as standalone classifiers often yields elevated falsepositive (FP) rates, which mislabel legitimate emails as phishing and create significant operational burden. This paper presents a personalized phishing detection framework that integrates LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). For each message, the system constructs user-specific context by retrieving a compact set of the user's historical legitimate emails and enriching it with real-time domain and URL reputation from a cyber-threat intelligence platform, then conditions the LLM's decision on this evidence. We evaluate four open-source LLMs (Llama4-Scout, DeepSeek-R1, Mistral-Saba, and Gemma2) on an email dataset collected from public and institutional sources. Results show high performance; for example, Llama4-Scout attains an F1-score of 0.9703 and achieves a 66.7% reduction in FPs with RAG. These findings validate that a RAG-based, user-profiling approach is both feasible and effective for building high-precision, low-friction email security systems that adapt to individual communication patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[RPO-RAG: Aligning Small LLMs with Relation-aware Preference Optimization for Knowledge Graph Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19225v2)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities, yet hallucinate on knowledge-intensive tasks. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this issue by grounding answers in external sources, e.g., knowledge graphs (KGs). However, existing KG-based RAG approaches rely on semantics-unaware path sampling and are weakly aligned with KG reasoning objectives, which limits further accuracy gains. They also feed retrieved paths directly into the reasoner without organizing them into answer-centered reasoning paths, hindering small LLMs' ability to leverage the retrieved knowledge. Furthermore, prior works predominantly rely on large LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT/GPT-4) or assume backbones above 7B parameters, leaving sub-7B models underexplored. We address this gap with RPO-RAG, the first KG-based RAG framework specifically designed for small LLMs, to the best of our knowledge. RPO-RAG introduces three key innovations: (1) a query-path semantic sampling strategy that provides informative supervisory signals; (2) a relation-aware preference optimization that aligns training with intermediate KG reasoning signals (e.g., relation); and (3) an answer-centered prompt design that organizes entities and reasoning paths in an interpretable format. Extensive experiments on two benchmark Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, demonstrate that RPO-RAG effectively bridges the performance gap between small and large language models. On WebQSP, it improves F1 by up to 8.8%, reflecting enhanced answer precision, while on CWQ it achieves new state-of-the-art results among models under 8B parameters in both Hit and F1. Overall, RPO-RAG substantially improves the reasoning capability of small LLMs, even under 3B parameters-highlighting their potential for resource-efficient and practical on-device KGQA applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at The Web Conference (WWW) 2026</p></details> |

Training-free pruning solutions (e.g., EOS-attention based methods) can reduce index vector size by approximately 60% without model adaptation, but often underperform random selection in high-compression scenarios (> 80%). Prior research (e.g., Light-ColPali) attributes this to the conclusion that visual token importance is inherently query-dependent, thereby questioning the feasibility of training-free pruning. In this work, we propose Structural Anchor Pruning (SAP), a training-free pruning method that identifies key visual patches from middle layers to achieve high performance compression. We also introduce Oracle Score Retention (OSR) protocol to evaluate how layer-wise information affects compression efficiency. Evaluations on the ViDoRe benchmark demonstrate that SAP reduces index vectors by over 90% while maintaining robust retrieval fidelity, providing a highly scalable solution for Visual RAG. Furthermore, our OSR-based analysis reveals that semantic structural anchor patches persist in the middle layers, unlike traditional pruning solutions that focus on the final layer where structural signals dissipate.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |
| **[Efficient and Transferable Agentic Knowledge Graph RAG via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26383v4)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge-graph retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) couples large language models (LLMs) with structured, verifiable knowledge graphs (KGs) to reduce hallucinations and expose reasoning traces. However, many KG-RAG systems compose multiple LLM modules (e.g planning, reasoning, and responding), inflating inference cost and binding behavior to a specific target KG. To address this, we introduce KG-R1, an agentic KG retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) framework through reinforcement learning (RL). KG-R1 utilizes a single agent that interacts with KGs as its environment, learning to retrieve at each step and incorporating the retrieved information into its reasoning and generation. The process is optimized through end-to-end RL. In controlled experiments across Knowledge-Graph Question Answering (KGQA) benchmarks, our method demonstrates both efficiency and transferability: Using Qwen-2.5-3B, KG-R1 improves answer accuracy with fewer generation tokens than prior multi-module workflow methods that use larger foundation or fine-tuned models. Furthermore, KG-R1 enables plug and play: after training, it maintains strong accuracy on new KGs without modification. These properties make KG-R1 a promising KG-RAG framework for real-world deployment. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Jinyeop3110/KG-R1.</p></details> | <details><summary>Wrong...</summary><p>Wrong numbers are reported for main results</p></details> |

The limitations of existing utility-driven retrieval approaches for RAG are that, firstly, they are resource-intensive typically requiring query encoding, and that secondly, they do not involve listwise ranking loss during training. The latter limitation is particularly critical, as the relative order between documents directly affects generation in RAG. To address this gap, we propose Lightweight Utility-driven Reranking for Efficient RAG (LURE-RAG), a framework that augments any black-box retriever with an efficient LambdaMART-based reranker. Unlike prior methods, LURE-RAG trains the reranker with a listwise ranking loss guided by LLM utility, thereby directly optimizing the ordering of retrieved documents. Experiments on two standard datasets demonstrate that LURE-RAG achieves competitive performance, reaching 97-98% of the state-of-the-art dense neural baseline, while remaining efficient in both training and inference. Moreover, its dense variant, UR-RAG, significantly outperforms the best existing baseline by up to 3%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Out of Style: RAG's Fragility to Linguistic Variation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08231v2)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the impressive performance of Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) systems across various NLP benchmarks, their robustness in handling real-world user-LLM interaction queries remains largely underexplored. This presents a critical gap for practical deployment, where user queries exhibit greater linguistic variations and can trigger cascading errors across interdependent RAG components. In this work, we systematically analyze how varying four linguistic dimensions (formality, readability, politeness, and grammatical correctness) impact RAG performance. We evaluate two retrieval models and nine LLMs, ranging from 3 to 72 billion parameters, across four information-seeking Question Answering (QA) datasets. Our results reveal that linguistic reformulations significantly impact both retrieval and generation stages, leading to a relative performance drop of up to 40.41% in Recall@5 scores for less formal queries and 38.86% in answer match scores for queries containing grammatical errors. Notably, RAG systems exhibit greater sensitivity to such variations compared to LLM-only generations, highlighting their vulnerability to error propagation due to linguistic shifts. These findings highlight the need for improved robustness techniques to enhance reliability in diverse user interactions.

To enable time-efficient insightful retrieval, we propose FastInsight. We first introduce a graph retrieval taxonomy that categorizes existing methods into three fundamental operations: vector search, graph search, and model-based search. Through this taxonomy, we identify two critical limitations in current approaches: the topology-blindness of model-based search and the semantics-blindness of graph search. FastInsight overcomes these limitations by interleaving two novel fusion operators: the Graph-based Reranker (GRanker), which functions as a graph model-based search, and Semantic-Topological eXpansion (STeX), which operates as a vector-graph search. Extensive experiments on broad retrieval and generation datasets demonstrate that FastInsight significantly improves both retrieval accuracy and generation quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a substantial Pareto improvement in the trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> | under review |

One-pass retrieval-and-write pipelines frequently yield shallow summaries, inconsistent grounding, and weak mechanisms for completeness verification. We introduce ADORE (Adaptive Deep Orchestration for Research in Enterprise), an agentic framework that replaces linear retrieval with iterative, user-steered investigation coordinated by a central orchestrator and a set of specialized agents. ADORE's key insight is that a structured Memory Bank (a curated evidence store with explicit claim-evidence linkage and section-level admissible evidence) enables traceable report generation and systematic checks for evidence completeness. Our contributions are threefold: (1) Memory-locked synthesis - report generation is constrained to a structured Memory Bank (Claim-Evidence Graph) with section-level admissible evidence, enabling traceable claims and grounded citations; (2) Evidence-coverage-guided execution - a retrieval-reflection loop audits section-level evidence coverage to trigger targeted follow-up retrieval and terminates via an evidence-driven stopping criterion; (3) Section-packed long-context grounding - section-level packing, pruning, and citation-preserving compression make long-form synthesis feasible under context limits. Across our evaluation suite, ADORE ranks first on DeepResearch Bench (52.65) and achieves the highest head-to-head preference win rate on DeepConsult (77.2%) against commercial systems.</p></details> |  |

A RAG Benchmark for Academic Citation Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14949v2)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of Web-based academic publications, more and more papers are being published annually, making it increasingly difficult to find relevant prior work. Citation prediction aims to automatically suggest appropriate references, helping scholars navigate the expanding scientific literature. Here we present \textbf{CiteRAG}, the first comprehensive retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-integrated benchmark for evaluating large language models on academic citation prediction, featuring a multi-level retrieval strategy, specialized retrievers, and generators. Our benchmark makes four core contributions: (1) We establish two instances of the citation prediction task with different granularity. Task 1 focuses on coarse-grained list-specific citation prediction, while Task 2 targets fine-grained position-specific citation prediction. To enhance these two tasks, we build a dataset containing 7,267 instances for Task 1 and 8,541 instances for Task 2, enabling comprehensive evaluation of both retrieval and generation. (2) We construct a three-level large-scale corpus with 554k papers spanning many major subfields, using an incremental pipeline. (3) We propose a multi-level hybrid RAG approach for citation prediction, fine-tuning embedding models with contrastive learning to capture complex citation relationships, paired with specialized generation models. (4) We conduct extensive experiments across state-of-the-art language models, including closed-source APIs, open-source models, and our fine-tuned generators, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework. Our open-source toolkit enables reproducible evaluation and focuses on academic literature, providing the first comprehensive evaluation framework for citation prediction and serving as a methodological template for other scientific domains.

By refining retrieval processes and improving contextual grounding, our approach improves both answer accuracy and informativeness. We conduct extensive evaluations on three popular QA datasets, TruthfulQA, SQuAD and WikiQA, across five Large Language Models (LLMs), demonstrating that our proposed approach consistently improves response quality over standard RAG implementations.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 tables, 2 figures; presented at IEEE CogMI 2025</p></details> |

We show that retrieval relevance metrics (e.g., NDCG) correlate weakly with end-to-end QA quality and can even become negatively correlated under multi-passage injection, where redundancy and mild conflicts destabilize generation. We propose \textbf{Information Gain Pruning (IGP)}, a deployment-friendly reranking-and-pruning module that selects evidence using a generator-aligned utility signal and filters weak or harmful passages before truncation, without changing existing budget interfaces. Across five open-domain QA benchmarks and multiple retrievers and generators, IGP consistently improves the quality--cost trade-off. In a representative multi-evidence setting, IGP delivers about +12--20% relative improvement in average F1 while reducing final-stage input tokens by roughly 76--79% compared to retriever-only baselines.</p></details> | 26 pages, 10 figures |

However, GFMs remain constrained by in-memory bottlenecks: they attempt to encode knowledge into model parameters, which limits semantic capacity, introduces heavy lossy compression with conflicts, and entangles graph representation with the knowledge in ways that hinder efficient adaptation, undermining scalability and interpretability. In this work,we propose RAG-GFM, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation aided Graph Foundation Model that offloads knowledge from parameters and complements parameterized learning. To externalize graph knowledge, we build a dual-modal unified retrieval module, where a semantic store from prefix-structured text and a structural store from centrality-based motif. To preserve heterogeneous information, we design a dual-view alignment objective that contrasts both modalities to capture both content and relational patterns. To enable efficient downstream adaptation, we perform in-context augmentation to enrich supporting instances with retrieved texts and motifs as contextual evidence. Extensive experiments on five benchmark graph datasets demonstrate that RAG-GFM consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art baselines in both cross-domain node and graph classification, achieving superior effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the Web Conference 2026 (Research Track)</p></details> |

The quality of generated content heavily relies on the usefulness of the retrieved information and the capacity of LLMs' internal information processing mechanism to incorporate it in answer generation. It is generally assumed that the retrieved information is relevant to the question. However, the retrieved information may have a variable degree of relevance and usefulness, depending on the question and the document collection. It is important to take into account the relevance of the retrieved information in answer generation. In this paper, we propose OpenDecoder, a new approach that leverages explicit evaluation of the retrieved information as quality indicator features for generation. We aim to build a RAG model that is more robust to varying levels of noisy context. Three types of explicit evaluation information are considered: relevance score, ranking score, and QPP (query performance prediction) score. The experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and better robustness of OpenDecoder by outperforming various baseline methods. Importantly, this paradigm is flexible to be integrated with the post-training of LLMs for any purposes and incorporated with any type of external indicators.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM WWW 2026</p></details> |

However, RAG is often challenged by reasoning-intensive question-answering (QA), since common retrieval methods like cosine similarity maximize relevance at the cost of introducing redundant content, which can reduce information recall. To address this, we introduce Diversity-Focused Retrieval-Augmented Generation (DF-RAG), which systematically incorporates diversity into the retrieval step to improve performance on complex, reasoning-intensive QA benchmarks. DF-RAG builds upon the Maximal Marginal Relevance framework to select information chunks that are both relevant to the query and maximally dissimilar from each other. A key innovation of DF-RAG is its ability to optimize the level of diversity for each query dynamically at test time without requiring any additional fine-tuning or prior information. We show that DF-RAG improves F1 performance on reasoning-intensive QA benchmarks by 4-10 percent over vanilla RAG using cosine similarity and also outperforms other established baselines. Furthermore, we estimate an Oracle ceiling of up to 18 percent absolute F1 gains over vanilla RAG, of which DF-RAG captures up to 91.3 percent.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Findings of EACL 2026</p></details> |

Recent works scale RAG at inference time along two complementary dimensions: sequential depth for iterative refinement and parallel width for coverage expansion. However, naive scaling causes context contamination and scaling inefficiency, leading to diminishing or negative returns despite increased computation. To address these limitations, we propose SPARC-RAG, a multi-agent framework that coordinates sequential and parallel inference-time scaling under a unified context management mechanism. SPARC-RAG employs specialized agents that maintain a shared global context and provide explicit control over the scaling process. It generates targeted, complementary sub-queries for each branch to enable diverse parallel exploration, and explicitly regulates exiting decisions based on answer correctness and evidence grounding. To optimize scaling behavior, we further introduce a lightweight fine-tuning method with process-level verifiable preferences, which improves the efficiency of sequential scaling and effectiveness of parallel scaling. Across single- and multi-hop QA benchmarks, SPARC-RAG consistently outperforms previous RAG baselines, yielding an average +6.2 F1 improvement under lower inference cost.</p></details> |  |

Existing datasets often rely on general-domain corpora or purely textual retrieval, failing to capture the complexity of specialized technical documents where information is inextricably multimodal and reasoning requires synthesizing disjoint evidence. We address this gap by introducing MiRAGE, a Multiagent framework for RAG systems Evaluation, that leverages a collaborative swarm of specialized agents to generate verified, domain-specific, multimodal, and multi-hop Question-Answer datasets. MiRAGE orchestrates a swarm of specialized agents: a recursive context optimization loop to aggregate scattered evidence, an adversarial verifier agent to guarantee factual grounding, and an agent to recognize the expert persona and the relevant domain to mimic expert cognitive workflows. Extensive empirical evaluation across four distinct domains (regulations, finance, quantitative biology, and journalism) demonstrates that MiRAGE generates datasets with significantly higher reasoning complexity (>2.3 average hops) and factual faithfulness. Our ablation studies point that MiRAGE can be powered by LLMs if textual descriptions of the images are available. Visual grounding still remains a frontier. By automating the creation of gold standard evaluation datasets that reflect the latent thematic structure of proprietary corpora, MiRAGE provides the necessary infrastructure to rigorously benchmark the next generation information retrieval systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, Submitted to ACL</p></details> |

However, the propensity for LLMs to generate hallucinations, defined as plausible but factually incorrect assertions, presents a critical barrier to the adoption of these technologies in high-stakes environments where information integrity is non-negotiable. This empirical evaluation explores the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures in mitigating these risks by grounding generative outputs in authoritative document context. Specifically, this study compares a baseline Vanilla LLM against Basic RAG and Advanced RAG pipelines utilizing cross-encoder re-ranking. The experimental framework employs a Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 model and an all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embedding model to process a corpus of official CDC policy analytical frameworks and guidance documents. The analysis measures the impact of two distinct chunking strategies, recursive character-based and token-based semantic splitting, on system accuracy, measured through faithfulness and relevance scores across a curated set of complex policy scenarios. Quantitative findings indicate that while Basic RAG architectures provide a substantial improvement in faithfulness (0.621) over Vanilla baselines (0.347), the Advanced RAG configuration achieves a superior faithfulness average of 0.797. These results demonstrate that two-stage retrieval mechanisms are essential for achieving the precision required for domain-specific policy question answering, though structural constraints in document segmentation remain a significant bottleneck for multi-step reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |

We evaluate whether domain knowledge graphs (KGs) improve Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for healthcare by constructing three PubMed-derived graphs: $\mathbb{G}_1$ (T2DM), $\mathbb{G}_2$ (Alzheimer's disease), and $\mathbb{G}_3$ (AD+T2DM). We design two probes: Probe 1 targets merged AD T2DM knowledge, while Probe 2 targets the intersection of $\mathbb{G}_1$ and $\mathbb{G}_2$. Seven instruction-tuned LLMs are tested across retrieval sources {No-RAG, $\mathbb{G}_1$, $\mathbb{G}_2$, $\mathbb{G}_1$ + $\mathbb{G}_2$, $\mathbb{G}_3$, $\mathbb{G}_1$+$\mathbb{G}_2$ + $\mathbb{G}_3$} and three decoding temperatures. Results show that scope alignment between probe and KG is decisive: precise, scope-matched retrieval (notably $\mathbb{G}_2$) yields the most consistent gains, whereas indiscriminate graph unions often introduce distractors that reduce accuracy. Larger models frequently match or exceed KG-RAG with a No-RAG baseline on Probe 1, indicating strong parametric priors, whereas smaller/mid-sized models benefit more from well-scoped retrieval. Temperature plays a secondary role; higher values rarely help. We conclude that precision-first, scope-matched KG-RAG is preferable to breadth-first unions, and we outline practical guidelines for graph selection, model sizing, and retrieval/reranking.

Most notably, indirect prompt injection and retrieval poisoning attack the web-native carriers that survive ingestion pipelines and are very concerning. We provide OpenRAG-Soc, a compact, reproducible benchmark-and-harness for web-facing RAG evaluation under these threats, in a discrete data package. The suite combines a social corpus with interchangeable sparse and dense retrievers and deployable mitigations - HTML/Markdown sanitization, Unicode normalization, and attribution-gated answered. It standardizes end-to-end evaluation from ingestion to generation and reports attacks time of one of the responses at answer time, rank shifts in both sparse and dense retrievers, utility and latency, allowing for apples-to-apples comparisons across carriers and defenses. OpenRAG-Soc targets practitioners who need fast, and realistic tests to track risk and harden deployments.</p></details> | WWW 2026 |

The challenge aims to address a critical limitation of modern Vision Language Models (VLMs): their propensity to hallucinate, especially when faced with egocentric imagery, long-tail entities, and complex, multi-hop questions. This issue is particularly problematic in real-world applications where users pose fact-seeking queries that demand high factual accuracy across diverse modalities. To tackle this, we propose a robust, multi-stage framework that prioritizes factual accuracy and truthfulness over completeness. Our solution integrates a lightweight query router for efficiency, a query-aware retrieval and summarization pipeline, a dual-pathways generation and a post-hoc verification. This conservative strategy is designed to minimize hallucinations, which incur a severe penalty in the competition's scoring metric. Our approach achieved 3rd place in Task 1, demonstrating the effectiveness of prioritizing answer reliability in complex multi-modal RAG systems. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/Breezelled/KDD-Cup-2025-Meta-CRAG-MM .</p></details> | <details><summary>KDD C...</summary><p>KDD Cup 2025 Meta CRAG-MM Challenge: Third Prize in the Single-Source Augmentation Task</p></details> |

Most existing design methods focus on vector-valued responses (e.g., Young's modulus and bandgap width), while the inverse design of functional responses remains challenging due to their high-dimensionality, the complexity of accommodating design requirements in inverse-design frameworks, and non-existence or non-uniqueness of feasible solutions. Although generative design approaches have shown promise, they are often data-hungry, handle design requirements heuristically, and may generate infeasible designs without uncertainty quantification. To address these challenges, we introduce a RAndom-forest-based Generative approach (RAG). By leveraging the small-data compatibility of random forests, RAG enables data-efficient predictions of high-dimensional functional responses. During the inverse design, the framework estimates the likelihood through the ensemble which quantifies the trustworthiness of generated designs while reflecting the relative difficulty across different requirements. The one-to-many mapping is addressed through single-shot design generation by sampling from the conditional likelihood. We demonstrate RAG on: 1) acoustic metamaterials with prescribed partial passbands/stopbands, and 2) mechanical metamaterials with targeted snap-through responses, using 500 and 1057 samples, respectively. Its data-efficiency is benchmarked against neural networks on a public mechanical metamaterial dataset with nonlinear stress-strain relations. Our framework provides a lightweight, trustworthy pathway to inverse design involving functional responses, expensive simulations, and complex design requirements, beyond metamaterials.</p></details> |  |
| **[Insider Knowledge: How Much Can RAG Systems Gain from Evaluation Secrets?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13227v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RAG systems are increasingly evaluated and optimized using LLM judges, an approach that is rapidly becoming the dominant paradigm for system assessment. Nugget-based approaches in particular are now embedded not only in evaluation frameworks but also in the architectures of RAG systems themselves. While this integration can lead to genuine improvements, it also creates a risk of faulty measurements due to circularity. In this paper, we investigate this risk through comparative experiments with nugget-based RAG systems, including Ginger and Crucible, against strong baselines such as GPT-Researcher. By deliberately modifying Crucible to generate outputs optimized for an LLM judge, we show that near-perfect evaluation scores can be achieved when elements of the evaluation - such as prompt templates or gold nuggets - are leaked or can be predicted. Our results highlight the importance of blind evaluation settings and methodological diversity to guard against mistaking metric overfitting for genuine system progress.</p></details> |  |
| **[VectorLiteRAG: Latency-Aware and Fine-Grained Resource Partitioning for Efficient RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08930v3)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems combine vector similarity search with large language models (LLMs) to deliver accurate, context-aware responses. However, co-locating the vector retriever and the LLM on shared GPU infrastructure introduces significant challenges: vector search is memory and I/O intensive, while LLM inference demands high throughput and low latency. Naive resource sharing often leads to severe performance degradation, particularly under high request load or large index sizes. We present VectorLiteRAG, a deployment-friendly RAG system that achieves latency-compliant inference without requiring additional hardware resources. VectorLiteRAG introduces a fine-grained GPU resource allocation mechanism based on detailed performance modeling and access pattern analysis. By estimating search latency and query hit rate distributions, it identifies an optimal index partitioning point across CPU and GPU tiers to minimize contention and maximize throughput. Our evaluations show that VectorLiteRAG consistently expands the SLO compliant request rate range across all tested configurations, including both small and large LLMs, and small and large vector databases compared to naive baselines and state of the art alternatives. In the best case, VectorLiteRAG improves the attainable SLO throughput by up to 1.5 times without compromising generation quality or requiring additional compute resources.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAGExplorer: A Visual Analytics System for the Comparative Diagnosis of RAG Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12991v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly enhanced the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce factually accurate and up-to-date responses. However, the performance of a RAG system is not determined by a single component but emerges from a complex interplay of modular choices, such as embedding models and retrieval algorithms. This creates a vast and often opaque configuration space, making it challenging for developers to understand performance trade-offs and identify optimal designs. To address this challenge, we present RAGExplorer, a visual analytics system for the systematic comparison and diagnosis of RAG configurations. RAGExplorer guides users through a seamless macro-to-micro analytical workflow. Initially, it empowers developers to survey the performance landscape across numerous configurations, allowing for a high-level understanding of which design choices are most effective. For a deeper analysis, the system enables users to drill down into individual failure cases, investigate how differences in retrieved information contribute to errors, and interactively test hypotheses by manipulating the provided context to observe the resulting impact on the generated answer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RAGExplorer through detailed case studies and user studies, validating its ability to empower developers in navigating the complex RAG design space. Our code and user guide are publicly available at https://github.com/Thymezzz/RAGExplorer.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures.

This increase leads to higher computational costs and longer Time to First Token (TTFT). To mitigate this issue, existing solutions aim to reuse the preprocessed KV cache of each retrieved chunk to accelerate RAG. However, the lack of cross-chunk contextual information leads to a significant drop in generation quality, leaving the potential benefits of KV cache reuse largely unfulfilled. The challenge lies in how to reuse the precomputed KV cache of chunks while preserving generation quality. We propose FusionRAG, a novel inference framework that optimizes both the preprocessing and reprocessing stages of RAG. In the offline preprocessing stage, we embed information from other related text chunks into each chunk, while in the online reprocessing stage, we recompute the KV cache for tokens that the model focuses on. As a result, we achieve a better trade-off between generation quality and efficiency. According to our experiments, FusionRAG significantly improves generation quality at the same recomputation ratio compared to previous state-of-the-art solutions. By recomputing fewer than 15% of the tokens, FusionRAG achieves up to 70% higher normalized F1 scores than baselines and reduces TTFT by 2.66x-9.39x compared to Full Attention.</p></details> |  |
| **[Principled Context Engineering for RAG: Statistical Guarantees via Conformal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17908v2)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances factual grounding in large language models (LLMs) by incorporating retrieved evidence, but LLM accuracy declines when long or noisy contexts exceed the model's effective attention span. Existing pre-generation filters rely on heuristics or uncalibrated LLM confidence scores, offering no statistical control over retained evidence. We evaluate and demonstrate context engineering through conformal prediction, a coverage-controlled filtering framework that removes irrelevant content while preserving recall of supporting evidence. Using both embedding- and LLM-based scoring functions, we test this approach on the NeuCLIR and RAGTIME collections. Conformal filtering consistently meets its target coverage, ensuring that a specified fraction of relevant snippets are retained, and reduces retained context by 2-3x relative to unfiltered retrieval. On NeuCLIR, downstream factual accuracy measured by ARGUE F1 improves under strict filtering and remains stable at moderate coverage, indicating that most discarded material is redundant or irrelevant. These results demonstrate that conformal prediction enables reliable, coverage-controlled context reduction in RAG, offering a model-agnostic and principled approach to context engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECIR 2026</p></details> |
| **[Ranking Free RAG: Replacing Re-ranking with Selection in RAG for Sensitive Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16014v4)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In sensitive domains, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) must be interpretable and robust because errors do not just mislead, they invite lawsuits, undermine scholarly credibility, and breach compliance. Stakeholders require traceable evidence, clear rationales for why specific evidence is selected, and safeguards against poisoned or misleading content. Yet current RAG pipelines rely on similarity-based retrieval with arbitrary top-k cutoffs, provide no explanation for selections, and remain vulnerable to poisoning attacks. We propose METEORA, which replaces these drawbacks with rationale-driven selection, using explicit reasoning to guide evidence choice, explain decisions, and improve robustness to RAG poisoning. METEORA operates in three stages: (1) a general-purpose LLM is preference-tuned to generate query-conditioned rationales using direct preference optimization; (2) these rationales drive an Evidence Chunk Selection Engine that pairs rationales with retrieved evidence for query-specific relevance and applies elbow detection to choose an adaptive cutoff (optionally expanding context with neighboring chunks); and (3) a Verifier LLM uses the rationales to detect and filter poisoned or misleading evidence before generation. Across six datasets, METEORA achieves 13.41% higher recall and, without expansion, 21.05% higher precision than the strongest baseline. It reduces the evidence needed for comparable recall by 80%, improving downstream answer accuracy by 33.34%, and strengthens adversarial defense by increasing F1 from 0.10 to 0.44.

Out-of-domain (OOD) queries can cause dense retrieval to surface weakly related context and lead the generator to produce fluent but unjustified responses. We study lightweight, KB-aligned OOD detection as an always-on gate for RAG systems. Our approach applies PCA to KB embeddings and scores queries in a compact subspace selected either by explained-variance retention (EVR) or by a separability-driven t-test ranking. We evaluate geometric semantic-search rules and lightweight classifiers across 16 domains, including high-stakes COVID-19 and Substance Use KBs, and stress-test robustness using both LLM-generated attacks and an in-the-wild 4chan attack. We find that low-dimensional detectors achieve competitive OOD performance while being faster, cheaper, and more interpretable than prompted LLM-based judges. Finally, human and LLM-based evaluations show that OOD queries primarily degrade the relevance of RAG outputs, showing the need for efficient external OOD detection to maintain safe, in-scope behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Effective and Unsupervised Social Event Detection and Evolution via RAG and Structural Entropy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12035v1)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing scale of social media, social event detection and evolution modeling have attracted increasing attention. Graph neural networks (GNNs) and transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs) have become mainstream approaches in this area. However, existing methods still face three major challenges. First, the sheer volume of social media messages makes learning resource-intensive. Second, the fragmentation of social media messages often impedes the model's ability to capture a comprehensive view of the events. Third, the lack of structured temporal context has hindered the development of effective models for event evolution, limiting users' access to event information. To address these challenges, we propose a foundation model for unsupervised Social Event Detection and Evolution, namely RagSEDE. Specifically, RagSEDE introduces a representativeness- and diversity-driven sampling strategy to extract key messages from massive social streams, significantly reducing noise and computational overhead. It further establishes a novel paradigm based on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that enhances PLMs in detecting events while simultaneously constructing and maintaining an evolving event knowledge base. Finally, RagSEDE leverages structural information theory to dynamically model event evolution keywords for the first time. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the superiority of RagSEDE in open-world social event detection and evolution.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, accepted for The Web Conference (WWW) 2026</p></details> |

A Fact-Checking Dataset for Evaluating the Robustness of RAG Against Misleading Retrievals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16101v5)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has shown impressive capabilities in mitigating hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs struggle to maintain consistent reasoning when exposed to misleading or conflicting evidence, especially in real-world domains such as politics, where information is polarized or selectively framed. Mainstream RAG benchmarks evaluate models under clean retrieval settings, where systems generate answers from gold-standard documents, or under synthetically perturbed settings, where documents are artificially injected with noise. These assumptions fail to reflect real-world conditions, often leading to an overestimation of RAG system performance. To address this gap, we introduce RAGuard, the first benchmark to evaluate the robustness of RAG systems against misleading retrievals. Unlike prior benchmarks that rely on synthetic noise, our fact-checking dataset captures naturally occurring misinformation by constructing its retrieval corpus from Reddit discussions. It categorizes retrieved evidence into three types: supporting, misleading, and unrelated, providing a realistic and challenging testbed for assessing how well RAG systems navigate different types of evidence. Our experiments reveal that, when exposed to potentially misleading retrievals, all tested LLM-powered RAG systems perform worse than their zero-shot baselines (i.e., no retrieval at all), while human annotators consistently perform better, highlighting LLMs' susceptibility to noisy environments. To our knowledge, RAGuard is the first benchmark to systematically assess the robustness of the RAG against misleading evidence. We expect this benchmark to drive future research toward improving RAG systems beyond idealized datasets, making them more reliable for real-world applications. The dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/UCSC-IRKM/RAGuard.</p></details> | <details><summary>Advan...</summary><p>Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

Current LLMs are trained on large code datasets and are capable of writing IEC 61131-3 compatible code out of the box, but they neither know specific function blocks, nor related project code. Moreover, companies like Mitsubishi Electric and their customers do not trust cloud providers. Hence, an own coding agent is the desired solution to cope with this. In this study, we present our work on a low-data domain coding assistant solution for industrial use. We show how we achieved high quality code generation without fine-tuning large models and by fine-tuning small local models for edge device usage. Our tool lets several AI models compete with each other, uses reasoning, corrects bugs automatically and checks code validity by compiling it directly in the chat interface. We support our approach with an extensive evaluation that comes with code compilation statistics and user ratings. We found that a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) supported coding assistant can work in low-data domains by using extensive prompt engineering and directed retrieval.</p></details> | ICIT2026 |

While existing work attributes hallucination to a simple over-reliance on parametric knowledge, we reframe this failure as an evolving, scale-dependent coordination failure between the Attention (reading) and Feed-Forward Network (recalling) pathways. We introduce FACTUM (Framework for Attesting Citation Trustworthiness via Underlying Mechanisms), a framework of four mechanistic scores: Contextual Alignment (CAS), Attention Sink Usage (BAS), Parametric Force (PFS), and Pathway Alignment (PAS). Our analysis reveals that correct citations are consistently marked by higher parametric force (PFS) and greater use of the attention sink (BAS) for information synthesis. Crucially, we find that "one-size-fits-all" theories are insufficient as the signature of correctness evolves with scale: while the 3B model relies on high pathway alignment (PAS), our best-performing 8B detector identifies a shift toward a specialized strategy where pathways provide distinct, orthogonal information. By capturing this complex interplay, FACTUM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 37.5% in AUC. Our results demonstrate that high parametric force is constructive when successfully coordinated with the Attention pathway, paving the way for more nuanced and reliable RAG systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECIR 2026. 13 pages, 2 figures</p></details> |

However, existing ranking models are primarily optimized for query--document relevance, which often misaligns with generators' preferences for evidence selection and citation, limiting their impact on response quality. Moreover, most approaches do not account for preference differences across generators, resulting in unstable cross-generator performance. We propose \textbf{Rank4Gen}, a generator-aware ranker for RAG that targets the goal of \emph{Ranking for Generators}. Rank4Gen introduces two key preference modeling strategies: (1) \textbf{From Ranking Relevance to Response Quality}, which optimizes ranking with respect to downstream response quality rather than query--document relevance; and (2) \textbf{Generator-Specific Preference Modeling}, which conditions a single ranker on different generators to capture their distinct ranking preferences. To enable such modeling, we construct \textbf{PRISM}, a dataset built from multiple open-source corpora and diverse downstream generators. Experiments on five challenging and recent RAG benchmarks demonstrate that RRank4Gen achieves strong and competitive performance for complex evidence composition in RAG.</p></details> |  |

Currently, the majority of existing approaches overlook the risks associated with exposing sensitive or access-controlled information directly to the generation model. Only a few approaches propose techniques to instruct the generative model to refrain from disclosing sensitive information; however, recent studies have also demonstrated that LLMs remain vulnerable to prompt injection attacks that can override intended behavioral constraints. For these reasons, we propose a novel approach to Selective Disclosure in Retrieval-Augmented Generation, called SD-RAG, which decouples the enforcement of security and privacy constraints from the generation process itself. Rather than relying on prompt-level safeguards, SD-RAG applies sanitization and disclosure controls during the retrieval phase, prior to augmenting the language model's input. Moreover, we introduce a semantic mechanism to allow the ingestion of human-readable dynamic security and privacy constraints together with an optimized graph-based data model that supports fine-grained, policy-aware retrieval. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the superiority of SD-RAG over baseline existing approaches, achieving up to a $58\%$ improvement in the privacy score, while also showing a strong resilience to prompt injection attacks targeting the generative model.</p></details> |  |

While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is widely adopted to improve grounding, confidence calibration in RAG settings remains poorly understood. We conduct a systematic study across four benchmarks, revealing that LLMs exhibit poor calibration performance due to noisy retrieved contexts. Specifically, contradictory or irrelevant evidence tends to inflate the model's false certainty, leading to severe overconfidence. To address this, we propose NAACL Rules (Noise-AwAre Confidence CaLibration Rules) to provide a principled foundation for resolving overconfidence under noise. We further design NAACL, a noise-aware calibration framework that synthesizes supervision from about 2K HotpotQA examples guided by these rules. By performing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with this data, NAACL equips models with intrinsic noise awareness without relying on stronger teacher models. Empirical results show that NAACL yields substantial gains, improving ECE scores by 10.9% in-domain and 8.0% out-of-domain. By bridging the gap between retrieval noise and verbal calibration, NAACL paves the way for both accurate and epistemically reliable LLMs.</p></details> |  |

While scaling generators often improves accuracy, it also increases inference and deployment overhead. We study an orthogonal axis: enlarging the retriever's corpus, and how it trades off with generator scale. Across multiple open-domain QA benchmarks, corpus scaling consistently strengthens RAG and can in many cases match the gains of moving to a larger model tier, though with diminishing returns at larger scales. Small- and mid-sized generators paired with larger corpora often rival much larger models with smaller corpora; mid-sized models tend to gain the most, while tiny and very large models benefit less. Our analysis suggests that these improvements arise primarily from increased coverage of answer-bearing passages, while utilization efficiency remains largely unchanged. Overall, our results characterize a corpus-generator trade-off in RAG and provide empirical guidance on how corpus scale and model capacity interact in this setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceeding Version of ECIR 2026</p></details> |

They are not just text, nor just numbers; they are a complex amalgam of narrative and structure. Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have attempted to address this complexity with a blunt tool: linearization. We convert rich, multidimensional tables into simple Markdown-style text strings, hoping that an embedding model will capture the geometry of a spreadsheet in a single vector. But it has already been shown that this is mathematically insufficient. This work presents Topo-RAG, a framework that challenges the assumption that "everything is text". We propose a dual architecture that respects the topology of the data: we route fluid narrative through traditional dense retrievers, while tabular structures are processed by a Cell-Aware Late Interaction mechanism, preserving their spatial relationships. Evaluated on SEC-25, a synthetic enterprise corpus that mimics real-world complexity, Topo-RAG demonstrates an 18.4% improvement in nDCG@10 on hybrid queries compared to standard linearization approaches. It's not just about searching better; it's about understanding the shape of information.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing RAG strategies treat retrieved passages in a flat and unstructured way, which prevents the model from capturing structural cues and constrains its ability to synthesize knowledge from dispersed evidence across documents. To overcome these limitations, we propose Disco-RAG, a discourse-aware framework that explicitly injects discourse signals into the generation process. Our method constructs intra-chunk discourse trees to capture local hierarchies and builds inter-chunk rhetorical graphs to model cross-passage coherence. These structures are jointly integrated into a planning blueprint that conditions the generation. Experiments on question answering and long-document summarization benchmarks show the efficacy of our approach. Disco-RAG achieves state-of-the-art results on the benchmarks without fine-tuning. These findings underscore the important role of discourse structure in advancing RAG systems.</p></details> |  |

A 3DSG is constructed from multiple images of a scene, where objects are represented as nodes and relationships as edges. However, existing works for open-vocabulary 3DSG generation suffer from both low object-level recognition accuracy and speed, mainly due to constrained viewpoints, occlusions, and redundant surface density. To address these challenges, we propose RAG-3DSG to mitigate aggregation noise through re-shot guided uncertainty estimation and support object-level Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) via reliable low-uncertainty objects. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic downsample-mapping strategy to accelerate cross-image object aggregation with adaptive granularity. Experiments on Replica dataset demonstrate that RAG-3DSG significantly improves node captioning accuracy in 3DSG generation while reducing the mapping time by two-thirds compared to the vanilla version.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

We quantify this challenge using Dhao, an indigenous language of Eastern Indonesia with no digital footprint beyond the New Testament (NT). When applied to the unseen Old Testament (OT), a standard NMT model fine-tuned on the NT drops from an in-domain score of 36.17 chrF++ to 27.11 chrF++. To recover this loss, we introduce a hybrid framework where a fine-tuned NMT model generates an initial draft, which is then refined by a Large Language Model (LLM) using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The final system achieves 35.21 chrF++ (+8.10 recovery), effectively matching the original in-domain quality. Our analysis reveals that this performance is driven primarily by the number of retrieved examples rather than the choice of retrieval algorithm. Qualitative analysis confirms the LLM acts as a robust "safety net," repairing severe failures in zero-shot domains.</p></details> |  |

However, multimodal retrieval-augmented diagnosis is highly challenging. We explore a lightweight mechanism for enhancing diagnostic performance of retrieval-augmented LVLMs. We train a lightweight LVLM-aware multimodal retriever, such that the retriever learns to return images and texts that guide the LVLM toward correct predictions. In our low-resource setting, we perform only lightweight fine-tuning with small amounts of data, and use only general-purpose backbone models, achieving competitive results in clinical classification and VQA tasks compared to medically pre-trained models with extensive training. In a novel analysis, we highlight a previously unexplored class of errors that we term inconsistent retrieval predictions: cases where different top-retrieved images yield different predictions for the same target. We find that these cases are challenging for all models, even for non-retrieval models, and that our retrieval optimization mechanism significantly improves these cases over standard RAG. However, our analysis also sheds light on gaps in the ability of LVLMs to utilize retrieved information for clinical predictions.

These manuals, written in natural language, describe many steps in detail. Unfortunately, the number, magnitude, and articulation of these descriptions can significantly slow down and complicate the retrieval of the correct procedure during critical incidents. Interestingly, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enables the development of tools based on conversational interfaces that can assist operators in their retrieval tasks, improving their capability to respond to incidents. This paper presents the results of a set of experiments that derive from the analysis of the troubleshooting procedures available in Fincantieri, a large international company developing complex naval cyber-physical systems. Results show that RAG can assist operators in reacting promptly to failure symptoms, although specific measures have to be taken into consideration to cross-validate recommendations before actuating them.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in the Software Engineering in Practice track at the 48th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2026)</p></details> |
| **[KPoEM: A Human-Annotated Dataset for Emotion Classification and RAG-Based Poetry Generation in Korean Modern Poetry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03932v2)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces KPoEM (Korean Poetry Emotion Mapping), a novel dataset that serves as a foundation for both emotion-centered analysis and generative applications in modern Korean poetry. Despite advancements in NLP, poetry remains underexplored due to its complex figurative language and cultural specificity. We constructed a multi-label dataset of 7,662 entries (7,007 line-level and 615 work-level), annotated with 44 fine-grained emotion categories from five influential Korean poets. The KPoEM emotion classification model, fine-tuned through a sequential strategy -- moving from general-purpose corpora to the specialized KPoEM dataset -- achieved an F1-micro score of 0.60, significantly outperforming previous models (0.43). The model demonstrates an enhanced ability to identify temporally and culturally specific emotional expressions while preserving core poetic sentiments. Furthermore, applying the structured emotion dataset to a RAG-based poetry generation model demonstrates the empirical feasibility of generating texts that reflect the emotional and cultural sensibilities of Korean literature. This integrated approach strengthens the connection between computational techniques and literary analysis, opening new pathways for quantitative emotion research and generative poetics. Overall, this study provides a foundation for advancing emotion-centered analysis and creation in modern Korean poetry.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 22 tables, 3 figures, Digital Humanities and Social Sciences Korea Conference, James Joo-Jin Kim Center for Korean Studies, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA</p></details> |
| **[Reliable Graph-RAG for Codebases: AST-Derived Graphs vs LLM-Extracted Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08773v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation for software engineering often relies on vector similarity search, which captures topical similarity but can fail on multi-hop architectural reasoning such as controller to service to repository chains, interface-driven wiring, and inheritance. This paper benchmarks three retrieval pipelines on Java codebases (Shopizer, with additional runs on ThingsBoard and OpenMRS Core): (A) vector-only No-Graph RAG, (B) an LLM-generated knowledge graph RAG (LLM-KB), and (C) a deterministic AST-derived knowledge graph RAG (DKB) built with Tree-sitter and bidirectional traversal. Using 15 architecture and code-tracing queries per repository, we measure indexing time, query latency, corpus coverage, cost, and answer correctness. DKB builds its graph in seconds, while LLM-KB requires much longer graph generation. LLM-KB also shows indexing incompleteness: on Shopizer, 377 files are skipped or missed, reducing embedded chunk coverage and graph size compared to DKB. End-to-end cost is modest for DKB relative to the vector-only baseline but much higher for LLM-KB, especially as repository scale increases. Query latency is similar for No-Graph and DKB, while LLM-KB is slower and more variable. On the Shopizer question suite, DKB achieves the highest correctness, LLM-KB is close behind, and the vector-only baseline performs worst on upstream architectural queries and has the highest hallucination risk. Overall, deterministic AST-derived graphs provide more reliable coverage and multi-hop grounding than LLM-extracted graphs at substantially lower indexing cost.</p></details> | 46 pages, 2 figures |
| **[RAGShaper: Eliciting Sophisticated Agentic RAG Skills via Automated Data Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08699v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) empowers large language models to autonomously plan and retrieve information for complex problem-solving. However, the development of robust agents is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality training data that reflects the noise and complexity of real-world retrieval environments. Conventional manual annotation is unscalable and often fails to capture the dynamic reasoning strategies required to handle retrieval failures. To bridge this gap, we introduce RAGShaper, a novel data synthesis framework designed to automate the construction of RAG tasks and robust agent trajectories. RAGShaper incorporates an InfoCurator to build dense information trees enriched with adversarial distractors spanning Perception and Cognition levels. Furthermore, we propose a constrained navigation strategy that forces a teacher agent to confront these distractors, thereby eliciting trajectories that explicitly demonstrate error correction and noise rejection. Comprehensive experiments confirm that models trained on our synthesized corpus significantly outperform existing baselines, exhibiting superior robustness in noise-intensive and complex retrieval tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAG-R1: Incentivizing the Search and Reasoning Capabilities of LLMs through Multi-query Parallelism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02962v6)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their remarkable capabilities, are prone to generating hallucinated or outdated content due to their static internal knowledge. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrated with Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a solution, these methods are fundamentally constrained by a single-query mode, leading to prohibitive latency and inherent brittleness. To overcome these limitations, we introduce RAG-R1, a novel two-stage training framework centered around multi-query parallelism. Our framework enables LLMs to adaptively leverage internal and external knowledge during the reasoning process while transitioning from the single-query mode to multi-query parallelism. This architectural shift bolsters reasoning robustness while significantly reducing inference latency. Extensive experiments on seven question-answering benchmarks confirm the superiority of our method, which outperforms the strongest baseline by up to 13.7% and decreases inference time by 11.1%.</p></details> |  |

In this research, we utilized the NIH Chest X-ray image to train the model and compared it in image-based RAG, text-based RAG, and baseline. [3] [5] In a result, the text-based RAG[2] e!ectively reduces the hallucination problem by using external knowledge information, and the image-based RAG improved the prediction con"dence and calibration by using the KNN methods. [4] Moreover, the GPT LLM showed better performance, a low hallucination rate, and better Expected Calibration Error(ECE) than Llama Llama-based model. This research shows the challenge of data imbalance, a complex multi-stage structure, but suggests a large experience environment and a balanced example of use.</p></details> | 9 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Is Agentic RAG worth it? An experimental comparison of RAG approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07711v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are usually defined by the combination of a generator and a retrieval component that extracts textual context from a knowledge base to answer user queries. However, such basic implementations exhibit several limitations, including noisy or suboptimal retrieval, misuse of retrieval for out-of-scope queries, weak query-document matching, and variability or cost associated with the generator. These shortcomings have motivated the development of "Enhanced" RAG, where dedicated modules are introduced to address specific weaknesses in the workflow. More recently, the growing self-reflective capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a new paradigm, which we refer to as "Agentic" RAG. In this approach, the LLM orchestrates the entire process-deciding which actions to perform, when to perform them, and whether to iterate-thereby reducing reliance on fixed, manually engineered modules. Despite the rapid adoption of both paradigms, it remains unclear which approach is preferable under which conditions. In this work, we conduct an extensive, empirically driven evaluation of Enhanced and Agentic RAG across multiple scenarios and dimensions. Our results provide practical insights into the trade-offs between the two paradigms, offering guidance on selecting the most effective RAG design for real-world applications, considering both costs and performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[From RAG to Agentic RAG for Faithful Islamic Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07528v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs are increasingly used for Islamic question answering, where ungrounded responses may carry serious religious consequences. Yet standard MCQ/MRC-style evaluations do not capture key real-world failure modes, notably free-form hallucinations and whether models appropriately abstain when evidence is lacking. To shed a light on this aspect we introduce ISLAMICFAITHQA, a 3,810-item bilingual (Arabic/English) generative benchmark with atomic single-gold answers, which enables direct measurement of hallucination and abstention. We additionally developed an end-to-end grounded Islamic modelling suite consisting of (i) 25K Arabic text-grounded SFT reasoning pairs, (ii) 5K bilingual preference samples for reward-guided alignment, and (iii) a verse-level Qur'an retrieval corpus of $\sim$6k atomic verses (ayat). Building on these resources, we develop an agentic Quran-grounding framework (agentic RAG) that uses structured tool calls for iterative evidence seeking and answer revision. Experiments across Arabic-centric and multilingual LLMs show that retrieval improves correctness and that agentic RAG yields the largest gains beyond standard RAG, achieving state-of-the-art performance and stronger Arabic-English robustness even with a small model (i.e., Qwen3 4B). We will make the experimental resources and datasets publicly available for the community.</p></details> |  |
| **[FROAV: A Framework for RAG Observation and Agent Verification -- Lowering the Barrier to LLM Agent Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07504v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their integration into autonomous agent systems has created unprecedented opportunities for document analysis, decision support, and knowledge retrieval. However, the complexity of developing, evaluating, and iterating on LLM-based agent workflows presents significant barriers to researchers, particularly those without extensive software engineering expertise. We present FROAV (Framework for RAG Observation and Agent Verification), an open-source research platform that democratizes LLM agent research by providing a plug-and-play architecture combining visual workflow orchestration, a comprehensive evaluation framework, and extensible Python integration. FROAV implements a multi-stage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline coupled with a rigorous "LLM-as-a-Judge" evaluation system, all accessible through intuitive graphical interfaces. Our framework integrates n8n for no-code workflow design, PostgreSQL for granular data management, FastAPI for flexible backend logic, and Streamlit for human-in-the-loop interaction. Through this integrated ecosystem, researchers can rapidly prototype RAG strategies, conduct prompt engineering experiments, validate agent performance against human judgments, and collect structured feedback-all without writing infrastructure code. We demonstrate the framework's utility through its application to financial document analysis, while emphasizing its material-agnostic architecture that adapts to any domain requiring semantic analysis. FROAV represents a significant step toward making LLM agent research accessible to a broader scientific community, enabling researchers to focus on hypothesis testing and algorithmic innovation rather than system integration challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Credible Plan-Driven RAG Method for Multi-Hop Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16787v3)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated strong performance in single-hop question answering (QA) by integrating external knowledge into large language models (LLMs). However, its effectiveness remains limited in multi-hop QA, which demands both stable reasoning and factual consistency. Existing approaches often provide partial solutions, addressing either reasoning trajectory stability or factual verification, but rarely achieving both simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we propose PAR-RAG, a three-stage Plan-then-Act-and-Review framework inspired by the PDCA cycle. PAR-RAG incorporates semantic complexity as a unifying principle through three key components: (i) complexity-aware exemplar selection guides plan generation by aligning decomposition granularity with question difficulty, thereby stabilizing reasoning trajectories; (ii) execution follows a structured retrieve-then-read process; and (iii) dual verification identifies and corrects intermediate errors while dynamically adjusting verification strength based on question complexity: emphasizing accuracy for simple queries and multi-evidence consistency for complex ones. This cognitively inspired framework integrates theoretical grounding with practical robustness. Experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that PAR-RAG consistently outperforms competitive baselines, while ablation studies confirm the complementary roles of complexity-aware planning and dual verification. Collectively, these results establish PAR-RAG as a robust and generalizable framework for reliable multi-hop reasoning.</p></details> | 24 pages, 7 figures |
| **[What Breaks Knowledge Graph based RAG? Benchmarking and Empirical Insights into Reasoning under Incomplete Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08344v4)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) is an increasingly explored approach for combining the reasoning capabilities of large language models with the structured evidence of knowledge graphs. However, current evaluation practices fall short: existing benchmarks often include questions that can be directly answered using existing triples in KG, making it unclear whether models perform reasoning or simply retrieve answers directly. Moreover, inconsistent evaluation metrics and lenient answer matching criteria further obscure meaningful comparisons. In this work, we introduce a general method for constructing benchmarks and present BRINK (Benchmark for Reasoning under Incomplete Knowledge) to systematically assess KG-RAG methods under knowledge incompleteness. Our empirical results show that current KG-RAG methods have limited reasoning ability under missing knowledge, often rely on internal memorization, and exhibit varying degrees of generalization depending on their design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a main conference paper at EACL 2026</p></details> |
| **[Fine-Tuning vs. RAG for Multi-Hop Question Answering with Novel Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07054v1)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-hop question answering is widely used to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), as it requires integrating multiple pieces of supporting knowledge to arrive at a correct answer. While prior work has explored different mechanisms for providing knowledge to LLMs, such as finetuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), their relative effectiveness for multi-hop question answering remains insufficiently understood, particularly when the required knowledge is temporally novel. In this paper, we systematically compare parametric and non-parametric knowledge injection methods for open-domain multi-hop question answering. We evaluate unsupervised fine-tuning (continual pretraining), supervised fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation across three 7B-parameter open-source LLMs. Experiments are conducted on two benchmarks: QASC, a standard multi-hop science question answering dataset, and a newly constructed dataset of over 10,000 multi-hop questions derived from Wikipedia events in 2024, designed to test knowledge beyond the models' pretraining cutoff. Our results show that unsupervised fine-tuning provides only limited gains over base models, suggesting that continual pretraining alone is insufficient for improving multi-hop reasoning accuracy. In contrast, retrieval-augmented generation yields substantial and consistent improvements, particularly when answering questions that rely on temporally novel information. Supervised fine-tuning achieves the highest overall accuracy across models and datasets. These findings highlight fundamental differences in how knowledge injection mechanisms support multi-hop question answering and underscore the importance of retrieval-based methods when external or compositional knowledge is required.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Effectiveness of Proposed Techniques to Reduce Energy Consumption in RAG Systems: A Controlled Experiment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02522v2)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rising energy demands of machine learning (ML), e.g., implemented in popular variants like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, have raised significant concerns about their environmental sustainability. While previous research has proposed green tactics for ML-enabled systems, their empirical evaluation within RAG systems remains largely unexplored. This study presents a controlled experiment investigating five practical techniques aimed at reducing energy consumption in RAG systems. Using a production-like RAG system developed at our collaboration partner, the Software Improvement Group, we evaluated the impact of these techniques on energy consumption, latency, and accuracy. Through a total of 9 configurations spanning over 200 hours of trials using the CRAG dataset, we reveal that techniques such as increasing similarity retrieval thresholds, reducing embedding sizes, applying vector indexing, and using a BM25S reranker can significantly reduce energy usage, up to 60% in some cases. However, several techniques also led to unacceptable accuracy decreases, e.g., by up to 30% for the indexing strategies. Notably, finding an optimal retrieval threshold and reducing embedding size substantially reduced energy consumption and latency with no loss in accuracy, making these two techniques truly energy-efficient. We present the first comprehensive, empirical study on energy-efficient design techniques for RAG systems, providing guidance for developers and researchers aiming to build sustainable RAG applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 2026 International Conference on Software Engineering: Software Engineering in Society (ICSE-SEIS'26)</p></details> |
| **[TreePS-RAG: Tree-based Process Supervision for Reinforcement Learning in Agentic RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06922v1)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) formulates question answering as a multi-step interaction between reasoning and information retrieval, and has recently been advanced by reinforcement learning (RL) with outcome-based supervision. While effective, relying solely on sparse final rewards limits step-wise credit assignment and provides weak guidance for intermediate reasoning and actions. Recent efforts explore process-level supervision, but typically depend on offline constructed training data, which risks distribution shift, or require costly intermediate annotations. We present TreePS-RAG, an online, tree-based RL framework for agentic RAG that enables step-wise credit assignment while retaining standard outcome-only rewards. Our key insight is to model agentic RAG reasoning as a rollout tree, where each reasoning step naturally maps to a node. This tree structure allows step utility to be estimated via Monte Carlo estimation over its descendant outcomes, yielding fine-grained process advantages without requiring intermediate labels. To make this paradigm practical, we introduce an efficient online tree construction strategy that preserves exploration diversity under a constrained computational budget. With a rollout cost comparable to strong baselines like Search-R1, experiments on seven multi-hop and general QA benchmarks across multiple model scales show that TreePS-RAG consistently and significantly outperforms both outcome-supervised and leading process-supervised RL methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[CSR-RAG: An Efficient Retrieval System for Text-to-SQL on the Enterprise Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06564v1)** | 2026-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural language to SQL translation (Text-to-SQL) is one of the long-standing problems that has recently benefited from advances in Large Language Models (LLMs). While most academic Text-to-SQL benchmarks request schema description as a part of natural language input, enterprise-scale applications often require table retrieval before SQL query generation. To address this need, we propose a novel hybrid Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system consisting of contextual, structural, and relational retrieval (CSR-RAG) to achieve computationally efficient yet sufficiently accurate retrieval for enterprise-scale databases. Through extensive enterprise benchmarks, we demonstrate that CSR-RAG achieves up to 40% precision and over 80% recall while incurring a negligible average query generation latency of only 30ms on commodity data center hardware, which makes it appropriate for modern LLM-based enterprise-scale systems.</p></details> |  |
