| **[SpecCLIP: Aligning and Translating Spectroscopic Measurements for Stars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01939v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language understanding through vast datasets and large-scale parameterization. Inspired by this success, we present SpecCLIP, a foundation model framework that extends LLM-inspired methodologies to stellar spectral analysis. Stellar spectra, akin to structured language, encode rich physical and chemical information about stars. By training foundation models on large-scale spectral datasets, our goal is to learn robust and informative embeddings that support diverse downstream applications. As a proof of concept, SpecCLIP involves pre-training on two spectral types--LAMOST low-resolution and Gaia XP--followed by contrastive alignment using the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) framework, adapted to associate spectra from different instruments. This alignment is complemented by auxiliary decoders that preserve spectrum-specific information and enable translation (prediction) between spectral types, with the former achieved by maximizing mutual information between embeddings and input spectra. The result is a cross-spectrum framework enabling intrinsic calibration and flexible applications across instruments. We demonstrate that fine-tuning these models on moderate-sized labeled datasets improves adaptability to tasks such as stellar-parameter estimation and chemical-abundance determination. SpecCLIP also enhances the accuracy and precision of parameter estimates benchmarked against external survey data. Additionally, its similarity search and cross-spectrum prediction capabilities offer potential for anomaly detection. Our results suggest that contrastively trained foundation models enriched with spectrum-aware decoders can advance precision stellar spectroscopy.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables.

| **[Agentar-Fin-R1: Enhancing Financial Intelligence through Domain Expertise, Training Efficiency, and Advanced Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16802v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit considerable promise in financial applications; however, prevailing models frequently demonstrate limitations when confronted with scenarios that necessitate sophisticated reasoning capabilities, stringent trustworthiness criteria, and efficient adaptation to domain-specific requirements. We introduce the Agentar-Fin-R1 series of financial large language models (8B and 32B parameters), specifically engineered based on the Qwen3 foundation model to enhance reasoning capabilities, reliability, and domain specialization for financial applications. Our optimization approach integrates a high-quality, systematic financial task label system with a comprehensive multi-layered trustworthiness assurance framework. This framework encompasses high-quality trustworthy knowledge engineering, multi-agent trustworthy data synthesis, and rigorous data validation governance. Through label-guided automated difficulty-aware optimization, tow-stage training pipeline, and dynamic attribution systems, we achieve substantial improvements in training efficiency. Our models undergo comprehensive evaluation on mainstream financial benchmarks including Fineva, FinEval, and FinanceIQ, as well as general reasoning datasets such as MATH-500 and GPQA-diamond. To thoroughly assess real-world deployment capabilities, we innovatively propose the Finova evaluation benchmark, which focuses on agent-level financial reasoning and compliance verification. Experimental results demonstrate that Agentar-Fin-R1 not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on financial tasks but also exhibits exceptional general reasoning capabilities, validating its effectiveness as a trustworthy solution for high-stakes financial applications. The Finova bench is available at https://github.com/antgroup/Finova.</p></details> |  |
| **[BetterCheck: Towards Safeguarding VLMs for Automotive Perception Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17722v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are growingly extended to process multimodal data such as text and video simultaneously. Their remarkable performance in understanding what is shown in images is surpassing specialized neural networks (NNs) such as Yolo that is supporting only a well-formed but very limited vocabulary, ie., objects that they are able to detect. When being non-restricted, LLMs and in particular state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs) show impressive performance to describe even complex traffic situations. This is making them potentially suitable components for automotive perception systems to support the understanding of complex traffic situations or edge case situation. However, LLMs and VLMs are prone to hallucination, which mean to either potentially not seeing traffic agents such as vulnerable road users who are present in a situation, or to seeing traffic agents who are not there in reality. While the latter is unwanted making an ADAS or autonomous driving systems (ADS) to unnecessarily slow down, the former could lead to disastrous decisions from an ADS. In our work, we are systematically assessing the performance of 3 state-of-the-art VLMs on a diverse subset of traffic situations sampled from the Waymo Open Dataset to support safety guardrails for capturing such hallucinations in VLM-supported perception systems. We observe that both, proprietary and open VLMs exhibit remarkable image understanding capabilities even paying thorough attention to fine details sometimes difficult to spot for us humans. However, they are also still prone to making up elements in their descriptions to date requiring hallucination detection strategies such as BetterCheck that we propose in our work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in The IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)2025</p></details> |
| **[AI Telephone Surveying: Automating Quantitative Data Collection with an AI Interviewer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17718v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of voice-enabled artificial intelligence (AI) systems, quantitative survey researchers have access to a new data-collection mode: AI telephone surveying. By using AI to conduct phone interviews, researchers can scale quantitative studies while balancing the dual goals of human-like interactivity and methodological rigor. Unlike earlier efforts that used interactive voice response (IVR) technology to automate these surveys, voice AI enables a more natural and adaptive respondent experience as it is more robust to interruptions, corrections, and other idiosyncrasies of human speech. We built and tested an AI system to conduct quantitative surveys based on large language models (LLM), automatic speech recognition (ASR), and speech synthesis technologies. The system was specifically designed for quantitative research, and strictly adhered to research best practices like question order randomization, answer order randomization, and exact wording. To validate the system's effectiveness, we deployed it to conduct two pilot surveys with the SSRS Opinion Panel and followed-up with a separate human-administered survey to assess respondent experiences. We measured three key metrics: the survey completion rates, break-off rates, and respondent satisfaction scores. Our results suggest that shorter instruments and more responsive AI interviewers may contribute to improvements across all three metrics studied.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Video Discovery: Agentic Search with Tool Use for Long-form Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18079v3)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-form video understanding presents significant challenges due to extensive temporal-spatial complexity and the difficulty of question answering under such extended contexts. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable advancements in video analysis capabilities and long context handling, they continue to exhibit limitations when processing information-dense hour-long videos. To overcome such limitations, we propose the Deep Video Discovery agent to leverage an agentic search strategy over segmented video clips. Different from previous video agents manually designing a rigid workflow, our approach emphasizes the autonomous nature of agents. By providing a set of search-centric tools on multi-granular video database, our DVD agent leverages the advanced reasoning capability of LLM to plan on its current observation state, strategically selects tools, formulates appropriate parameters for actions, and iteratively refines its internal reasoning in light of the gathered information. We perform comprehensive evaluation on multiple long video understanding benchmarks that demonstrates the advantage of the entire system design. Our DVD agent achieves SOTA performance, significantly surpassing prior works by a large margin on the challenging LVBench dataset. Comprehensive ablation studies and in-depth tool analyses are also provided, yielding insights to further advance intelligent agents tailored for long-form video understanding tasks. The code has been released in https://github.com/microsoft/DeepVideoDiscovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>V3 dr...</summary><p>V3 draft. Under review</p></details> |
| **[HydraOpt: Navigating the Efficiency-Performance Trade-off of Adapter Merging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17706v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often leverage adapters, such as low-rank-based adapters, to achieve strong performance on downstream tasks. However, storing a separate adapter for each task significantly increases memory requirements, posing a challenge for resource-constrained environments such as mobile devices. Although model merging techniques can reduce storage costs, they typically result in substantial performance degradation. In this work, we introduce HydraOpt, a new model merging technique that capitalizes on the inherent similarities between the matrices of low-rank adapters. Unlike existing methods that produce a fixed trade-off between storage size and performance, HydraOpt allows us to navigate this spectrum of efficiency and performance. Our experiments show that HydraOpt significantly reduces storage size (48% reduction) compared to storing all adapters, while achieving competitive performance (0.2-1.8% drop). Furthermore, it outperforms existing merging techniques in terms of performance at the same or slightly worse storage efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Greater Leverage: Scaling Laws for Efficient Mixture-of-Experts Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17702v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a dominant architecture for scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiently by decoupling total parameters from computational cost. However, this decoupling creates a critical challenge: predicting the model capacity of a given MoE configurations (e.g., expert activation ratio and granularity) remains an unresolved problem. To address this gap, we introduce Efficiency Leverage (EL), a metric quantifying the computational advantage of an MoE model over a dense equivalent. We conduct a large-scale empirical study, training over 300 models up to 28B parameters, to systematically investigate the relationship between MoE architectural configurations and EL. Our findings reveal that EL is primarily driven by the expert activation ratio and the total compute budget, both following predictable power laws, while expert granularity acts as a non-linear modulator with a clear optimal range. We integrate these discoveries into a unified scaling law that accurately predicts the EL of an MoE architecture based on its configuration. To validate our derived scaling laws, we designed and trained Ling-mini-beta, a pilot model for Ling-2.0 series with only 0.85B active parameters, alongside a 6.1B dense model for comparison. When trained on an identical 1T high-quality token dataset, Ling-mini-beta matched the performance of the 6.1B dense model while consuming over 7x fewer computational resources, thereby confirming the accuracy of our scaling laws. This work provides a principled and empirically-grounded foundation for the scaling of efficient MoE models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Thinking Isn't an Illusion: Overcoming the Limitations of Reasoning Models via Tool Augmentations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17699v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have become a central focus in today's large language model (LLM) research, where models are designed to output a step-by-step thinking process before arriving at a final answer to handle complex reasoning tasks. Despite their promise, recent empirical studies (e.g., [Shojaee et al., 2025] from Apple) suggest that this thinking process may not actually enhance reasoning ability, where LLMs without explicit reasoning actually outperform LRMs on tasks with low or high complexity. In this work, we revisit these findings and investigate whether the limitations of LRMs persist when tool augmentations are introduced. We incorporate two types of tools, Python interpreters and scratchpads, and evaluate three representative LLMs and their LRM counterparts on Apple's benchmark reasoning puzzles. Our results show that, with proper tool use, LRMs consistently outperform their non-reasoning counterparts across all levels of task complexity. These findings challenge the recent narrative that reasoning is an illusion and highlight the potential of tool-augmented LRMs for solving complex problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Mathematical Theory of Discursive Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06565v5)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) turn writing into a live exchange between humans and software. We characterize this new medium as a discursive network that treats people and LLMs as equal nodes and tracks how their statements circulate. We define the generation of erroneous information as invalidation (any factual, logical, or structural breach) and show it follows four hazards: drift from truth, self-repair, fresh fabrication, and external detection. We develop a general mathematical model of discursive networks that shows that a network governed only by drift and self-repair stabilizes at a modest error rate. Giving each false claim even a small chance of peer review shifts the system to a truth-dominant state. We operationalize peer review with the open-source Flaws-of-Others (FOO) algorithm: a configurable loop in which any set of agents critique one another while a harmonizer merges their verdicts. We identify an ethical transgression, epithesis, that occurs when humans fail to engage in the discursive network. The takeaway is practical and cultural: reliability in this new medium comes not from perfecting single models but from connecting imperfect ones into networks that enforce mutual accountability.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables, 3 algorithm, 61 references</p></details> |
| **[Symbiotic Agents: A Novel Paradigm for Trustworthy AGI-driven Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17695v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based autonomous agents are expected to play a vital role in the evolution of 6G networks, by empowering real-time decision-making related to management and service provisioning to end-users. This shift facilitates the transition from a specialized intelligence approach, where artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms handle isolated tasks, to artificial general intelligence (AGI)-driven networks, where agents possess broader reasoning capabilities and can manage diverse network functions. In this paper, we introduce a novel agentic paradigm that combines LLMs with real-time optimization algorithms towards Trustworthy AI, defined as symbiotic agents. Optimizers at the LLM's input-level provide bounded uncertainty steering for numerically precise tasks, whereas output-level optimizers supervised by the LLM enable adaptive real-time control. We design and implement two novel agent types including: (i) Radio Access Network optimizers, and (ii) multi-agent negotiators for Service-Level Agreements (SLAs). We further propose an end-to-end architecture for AGI networks and evaluate it on a 5G testbed capturing channel fluctuations from moving vehicles. Results show that symbiotic agents reduce decision errors fivefold compared to standalone LLM-based agents, while smaller language models (SLM) achieve similar accuracy with a 99.9% reduction in GPU resource overhead and in near-real-time loops of 82 ms. A multi-agent demonstration for collaborative RAN on the real-world testbed highlights significant flexibility in service-level agreement and resource allocation, reducing RAN over-utilization by approximately 44%. Drawing on our findings and open-source implementations, we introduce the symbiotic paradigm as the foundation for next-generation, AGI-driven networks-systems designed to remain adaptable, efficient, and trustworthy even as LLMs advance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Computer Networks AI for 6G</p></details> |
| **[LoX: Low-Rank Extrapolation Robustifies LLM Safety Against Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15606v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable in real-world applications. However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning - even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations. The code is available at github.com/VITA-Group/LoX.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simulating multiple human perspectives in socio-ecological systems using large language models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17680v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding socio-ecological systems requires insights from diverse stakeholder perspectives, which are often hard to access. To enable alternative, simulation-based exploration of different stakeholder perspectives, we develop the HoPeS (Human-Oriented Perspective Shifting) modelling framework. HoPeS employs agents powered by large language models (LLMs) to represent various stakeholders; users can step into the agent roles to experience perspectival differences. A simulation protocol serves as a "scaffold" to streamline multiple perspective-taking simulations, supporting users in reflecting on, transitioning between, and integrating across perspectives. A prototype system is developed to demonstrate HoPeS in the context of institutional dynamics and land use change, enabling both narrative-driven and numerical experiments. In an illustrative experiment, a user successively adopts the perspectives of a system observer and a researcher - a role that analyses data from the embedded land use model to inform evidence-based decision-making for other LLM agents representing various institutions. Despite the user's effort to recommend technically sound policies, discrepancies persist between the policy recommendation and implementation due to stakeholders' competing advocacies, mirroring real-world misalignment between researcher and policymaker perspectives. The user's reflection highlights the subjective feelings of frustration and disappointment as a researcher, especially due to the challenge of maintaining political neutrality while attempting to gain political influence. Despite this, the user exhibits high motivation to experiment with alternative narrative framing strategies, suggesting the system's potential in exploring different perspectives. Further system and protocol refinement are likely to enable new forms of interdisciplinary collaboration in socio-ecological simulations.</p></details> |  |

To support this shift, scalable protocols for tool integration are essential. The Model Context Protocol (MCP), introduced by Anthropic in 2024, offers a schema-driven standard for dynamic tool discovery and invocation. Yet, building MCP servers remains manual and repetitive, requiring developers to write glue code, handle authentication, and configure schemas by hand-replicating much of the integration effort MCP aims to eliminate. This paper investigates whether MCP server construction can be meaningfully automated. We begin by analyzing adoption trends: among 22,000+ MCP-tagged GitHub repositories created within six months of release, fewer than 5% include servers, typically small, single-maintainer projects dominated by repetitive scaffolding. To address this gap, we present AutoMCP, a compiler that generates MCP servers from OpenAPI 2.0/3.0 specifications. AutoMCP parses REST API definitions and produces complete server implementations, including schema registration and authentication handling. We evaluate AutoMCP on 50 real-world APIs spanning 5,066 endpoints across over 10 domains. From a stratified sample of 1,023 tool calls, 76.5% succeeded out of the box. Manual failure analysis revealed five recurring issues, all attributable to inconsistencies or omissions in the OpenAPI contracts. After minor fixes, averaging 19 lines of spec changes per API, AutoMCP achieved 99.9% success. Our findings (i) analyze MCP adoption and quantify the cost of manual server development, (ii) demonstrate that OpenAPI specifications, despite quality issues, enable near-complete MCP server automation, and (iii) contribute a corpus of 5,066 callable tools along with insights on repairing common specification flaws.</p></details> |  |
| **[See the Forest and the Trees: A Synergistic Reasoning Framework for Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17659v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have pushed the frontiers of Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (KBVQA), yet their reasoning is fundamentally bottlenecked by a reliance on uni-dimensional evidence. This "seeing only the trees, but not the forest" approach prevents robust, multi-faceted understanding. Inspired by the principle of seeing both the forest and trees, we propose Synergos-VQA, a novel synergistic reasoning framework. At its core, Synergos-VQA concurrently generates and fuses three complementary evidence streams at inference time: (1) Holistic Evidence to perceive the entire scene (the "forest"), (2) Structural Evidence from a prototype-driven module to identify key objects (the "trees"), and (3) Causal Evidence from a counterfactual probe to ensure the reasoning is robustly grounded. By synergistically fusing this multi-faceted evidence, our framework achieves a more comprehensive and reliable reasoning process. Extensive experiments show that Synergos-VQA decisively establishes a new state-of-the-art on three challenging benchmarks, including OK-VQA and A-OKVQA. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates strong plug-and-play capabilities, significantly boosting various open-source MLLMs and proving that superior methodological design can outperform sheer model scale.</p></details> |  |

Using LLMs to Identify Negative Campaigning in 18M Tweets across 19 Countries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17636v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Negative campaigning is a central feature of political competition, yet empirical research has been limited by the high cost and limited scalability of existing classification methods. This study makes two key contributions. First, it introduces zero-shot Large Language Models (LLMs) as a novel approach for cross-lingual classification of negative campaigning. Using benchmark datasets in ten languages, we demonstrate that LLMs achieve performance on par with native-speaking human coders and outperform conventional supervised machine learning approaches. Second, we leverage this novel method to conduct the largest cross-national study of negative campaigning to date, analyzing 18 million tweets posted by parliamentarians in 19 European countries between 2017 and 2022. The results reveal consistent cross-national patterns: governing parties are less likely to use negative messaging, while ideologically extreme and populist parties -- particularly those on the radical right -- engage in significantly higher levels of negativity. These findings advance our understanding of how party-level characteristics shape strategic communication in multiparty systems. More broadly, the study demonstrates the potential of LLMs to enable scalable, transparent, and replicable research in political communication across linguistic and cultural contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hybrid Early-Exit Algorithm for Large Language Models Based on Space Alignment Decoding (SPADE)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17618v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models are computationally expensive due to their deep structures. Prior research has shown that intermediate layers contain sufficient information to generate accurate answers, leading to the development of early-exit algorithms that reduce inference costs by terminating computation at earlier layers. However, these methods often suffer from poor performance due to misalignment between intermediate and output layer representations that lead to decoding inaccuracy. To address these challenges, we propose SPADE (SPace Alignment DEcoding), a novel decoding method that aligns intermediate layer representations with the output layer by propagating a minimally reduced sequence consisting of only the start token and the answer token. We further optimize the early-exit decision-making process by training a linear approximation of SPADE that computes entropy-based confidence metrics. Putting them together, we create a hybrid early-exit algorithm that monitors confidence levels and stops inference at intermediate layers while using SPADE to generate high-quality outputs. This approach significantly reduces inference costs without compromising accuracy, offering a scalable and efficient solution for deploying large language models in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

We propose Multi-Level Explanations for Generative Language Models (MExGen), a technique to provide explanations for context-grounded text generation. MExGen assigns scores to parts of the context to quantify their influence on the model's output. It extends attribution methods like LIME and SHAP to LLMs used in context-grounded tasks where (1) inference cost is high, (2) input text is long, and (3) the output is text. We conduct a systematic evaluation, both automated and human, of perturbation-based attribution methods for summarization and question answering. The results show that our framework can provide more faithful explanations of generated output than available alternatives, including LLM self-explanations. We open-source code for MExGen as part of the ICX360 toolkit: https://github$.$com/IBM/ICX360.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as an oral presentation at ACL 2025.

The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has profoundly transformed AM, enabling advanced in-context learning, prompt-based generation, and robust cross-domain adaptability. This survey systematically synthesizes recent advancements in LLM-driven AM. We provide a concise review of foundational theories and annotation frameworks, alongside a meticulously curated catalog of datasets. A key contribution is our comprehensive taxonomy of AM subtasks, elucidating how contemporary LLM techniques -- such as prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning, and retrieval augmentation -- have reconfigured their execution. We further detail current LLM architectures and methodologies, critically assess evaluation practices, and delineate pivotal challenges including long-context reasoning, interpretability, and annotation bottlenecks. Conclusively, we highlight emerging trends and propose a forward-looking research agenda for LLM-based computational argumentation, aiming to strategically guide researchers in this rapidly evolving domain.</p></details> | Work draft |
| **[HyDRA: A Hybrid-Driven Reasoning Architecture for Verifiable Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15917v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The synergy between symbolic knowledge, often represented by Knowledge Graphs (KGs), and the generative capabilities of neural networks is central to advancing neurosymbolic AI. A primary bottleneck in realizing this potential is the difficulty of automating KG construction, which faces challenges related to output reliability, consistency, and verifiability. These issues can manifest as structural inconsistencies within the generated graphs, such as the formation of disconnected $\textit{isolated islands}$ of data or the inaccurate conflation of abstract classes with specific instances. To address these challenges, we propose HyDRA, a $\textbf{Hy}$brid-$\textbf{D}$riven $\textbf{R}$easoning $\textbf{A}$rchitecture designed for verifiable KG automation. Given a domain or an initial set of documents, HyDRA first constructs an ontology via a panel of collaborative neurosymbolic agents. These agents collaboratively agree on a set of competency questions (CQs) that define the scope and requirements the ontology must be able to answer. Given these CQs, we build an ontology graph that subsequently guides the automated extraction of triplets for KG generation from arbitrary documents. Inspired by design-by-contracts (DbC) principles, our method leverages verifiable contracts as the primary control mechanism to steer the generative process of Large Language Models (LLMs). To verify the output of our approach, we extend beyond standard benchmarks and propose an evaluation framework that assesses the functional correctness of the resulting KG by leveraging symbolic verifications as described by the neurosymbolic AI framework, $\textit{SymbolicAI}$. This work contributes a hybrid-driven architecture for improving the reliability of automated KG construction and the exploration of evaluation methods for measuring the functional integrity of its output. The code is publicly available.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

While many speculate how and when A.I. will achieve A.G.I., there is no clear agreement on how A.G.I. can be detected in A.I. models, even when popular tools like the Turing test (and its modern variations) are used to measure their intelligence. In this work, we discuss why traditional methods like the Turing test do not suffice for measuring or detecting A.G.I. and provide a new, practical method that can be used to decide if a system (computer or any other) has reached or surpassed A.G.I. To achieve this, we make two new contributions. First, we present a clear definition for general intelligence (G.I.) and set a G.I. Threshold (G.I.T.) that can be used to distinguish between systems that achieve A.G.I. and systems that do not. Second, we present a new framework on how to construct tests that can detect if a system has achieved G.I. in a simple, comprehensive, and clear-cut fail/pass way. We call this novel framework the Turing test 2.0. We then demonstrate real-life examples of applying tests that follow our Turing test 2.0 framework on modern A.I. models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fairness Evaluation of Large Language Models in Academic Library Reference Services](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04224v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As libraries explore large language models (LLMs) for use in virtual reference services, a key question arises: Can LLMs serve all users equitably, regardless of demographics or social status? While they offer great potential for scalable support, LLMs may also reproduce societal biases embedded in their training data, risking the integrity of libraries' commitment to equitable service. To address this concern, we evaluate whether LLMs differentiate responses across user identities by prompting six state-of-the-art LLMs to assist patrons differing in sex, race/ethnicity, and institutional role. We found no evidence of differentiation by race or ethnicity, and only minor evidence of stereotypical bias against women in one model. LLMs demonstrated nuanced accommodation of institutional roles through the use of linguistic choices related to formality, politeness, and domain-specific vocabularies, reflecting professional norms rather than discriminatory treatment. These findings suggest that current LLMs show a promising degree of readiness to support equitable and contextually appropriate communication in academic library reference services.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Neurons to Semantics: Evaluating Cross-Linguistic Alignment Capabilities of Large Language Models via Neurons Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14900v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multilingual capabilities, however, how to evaluate cross-lingual alignment remains underexplored. Existing alignment benchmarks primarily focus on sentence embeddings, but prior research has shown that neural models tend to induce a non-smooth representation space, which impact of semantic alignment evaluation on low-resource languages. Inspired by neuroscientific findings that similar information activates overlapping neuronal regions, we propose a novel Neuron State-Based Cross-Lingual Alignment (NeuronXA) to assess the cross-lingual a lignment capabilities of LLMs, which offers a more semantically grounded approach to assess cross-lingual alignment. We evaluate NeuronXA on several prominent multilingual LLMs (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, GLM, and OLMo) across two transfer tasks and three multilingual benchmarks. The results demonstrate that with only 100 parallel sentence pairs, NeuronXA achieves a Pearson correlation of 0.9556 with downstream tasks performance and 0.8514 with transferability. These findings demonstrate NeuronXA's effectiveness in assessing both cross-lingual alignment and transferability, even with a small dataset. This highlights its potential to advance cross-lingual alignment research and to improve the semantic understanding of multilingual LLMs.</p></details> | ACL main 2025 |
| **[CodeReasoner: Enhancing the Code Reasoning Ability with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17548v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code reasoning is a fundamental capability for large language models (LLMs) in the code domain. It involves understanding and predicting a program's execution behavior, such as determining the output for a given input or whether a specific statement will be executed. This capability is essential for downstream tasks like debugging, code generation, and program repair. Prior approaches mainly rely on supervised fine-tuning to improve performance in code reasoning tasks. However, they often show limited gains and fail to generalize across diverse scenarios. We argue this is due to two core issues: the low quality of training data and the limitations of supervised fine-tuning, which struggles to teach general reasoning skills. To address these challenges, we propose CodeReasoner, a framework that spans both dataset construction and a two-stage training process. First, we introduce a method to construct datasets that focus on the core execution logic of Python programs. Next, we apply instruction tuning to inject execution-specific knowledge distilled from a powerful teacher model. We then enhance reasoning and generalization through GRPO reinforcement learning on top of the fine-tuned model. Experiments on three widely-used code reasoning benchmarks show that CodeReasoner improves performance by 27.1% to 40.2% over prior methods using a 7B model. Notably, the 7B model matches GPT-4o on key tasks like input/output and coverage prediction. When scaled to 14B, CodeReasoner outperforms GPT-4o across all benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each training stage and highlight the importance of reasoning chains.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present the Anticipate, Simulate, Reason (ASR) framework, a generative AI method that enables users to proactively identify and comprehend scams within instant messaging platforms. Using large language models, ASR predicts scammer responses, creates realistic scam conversations, and delivers real-time, interpretable support to end-users. We develop ScamGPT-J, a domain-specific language model fine-tuned on a new, high-quality dataset of scam conversations covering multiple scam types. Thorough experimental evaluation shows that the ASR framework substantially enhances scam detection, particularly in challenging contexts such as job scams, and uncovers important demographic patterns in user vulnerability and perceptions of AI-generated assistance. Our findings reveal a contradiction where those most at risk are often least receptive to AI support, emphasizing the importance of user-centered design in AI-driven fraud prevention. This work advances both the practical and theoretical foundations for interpretable, human-centered AI systems in combating evolving digital threats.</p></details> |  |
| **[AssertFlip: Reproducing Bugs via Inversion of LLM-Generated Passing Tests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17542v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bug reproduction is critical in the software debugging and repair process, yet the majority of bugs in open-source and industrial settings lack executable tests to reproduce them at the time they are reported, making diagnosis and resolution more difficult and time-consuming. To address this challenge, we introduce AssertFlip, a novel technique for automatically generating Bug Reproducible Tests (BRTs) using large language models (LLMs). Unlike existing methods that attempt direct generation of failing tests, AssertFlip first generates passing tests on the buggy behaviour and then inverts these tests to fail when the bug is present. We hypothesize that LLMs are better at writing passing tests than ones that crash or fail on purpose. Our results show that AssertFlip outperforms all known techniques in the leaderboard of SWT-Bench, a benchmark curated for BRTs. Specifically, AssertFlip achieves a fail-to-pass success rate of 43.6% on the SWT-Bench-Verified subset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constructing Ophthalmic MLLM for Positioning-diagnosis Collaboration Through Clinical Cognitive Chain Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17539v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate significant potential in the field of medical diagnosis. However, they face critical challenges in specialized domains such as ophthalmology, particularly the fragmentation of annotation granularity and inconsistencies in clinical reasoning logic, which hinder precise cross-modal understanding. This paper introduces FundusExpert, an ophthalmology-specific MLLM with integrated positioning-diagnosis reasoning capabilities, along with FundusGen, a dataset constructed through the intelligent Fundus-Engine system. Fundus-Engine automates localization and leverages MLLM-based semantic expansion to integrate global disease classification, local object detection, and fine-grained feature analysis within a single fundus image. Additionally, by constructing a clinically aligned cognitive chain, it guides the model to generate interpretable reasoning paths. FundusExpert, fine-tuned with instruction data from FundusGen, achieves the best performance in ophthalmic question-answering tasks, surpassing the average accuracy of the 40B MedRegA by 26.6%. It also excels in zero-shot report generation tasks, achieving a clinical consistency of 77.0%, significantly outperforming GPT-4o's 47.6%. Furthermore, we reveal a scaling law between data quality and model capability ($L \propto N^{0.068}$), demonstrating that the cognitive alignment annotations in FundusGen enhance data utilization efficiency. By integrating region-level localization with diagnostic reasoning chains, our work develops a scalable, clinically-aligned MLLM and explores a pathway toward bridging the visual-language gap in specific MLLMs. Our project can be found at https://github.com/MeteorElf/FundusExpert.</p></details> |  |
| **[Speech as a Multimodal Digital Phenotype for Multi-Task LLM-based Mental Health Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23822v3)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech is a noninvasive digital phenotype that can offer valuable insights into mental health conditions, but it is often treated as a single modality. In contrast, we propose the treatment of patient speech data as a trimodal multimedia data source for depression detection. This study explores the potential of large language model-based architectures for speech-based depression prediction in a multimodal regime that integrates speech-derived text, acoustic landmarks, and vocal biomarkers. Adolescent depression presents a significant challenge and is often comorbid with multiple disorders, such as suicidal ideation and sleep disturbances. This presents an additional opportunity to integrate multi-task learning (MTL) into our study by simultaneously predicting depression, suicidal ideation, and sleep disturbances using the multimodal formulation. We also propose a longitudinal analysis strategy that models temporal changes across multiple clinical interactions, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the conditions' progression. Our proposed approach, featuring trimodal, longitudinal MTL is evaluated on the Depression Early Warning dataset. It achieves a balanced accuracy of 70.8%, which is higher than each of the unimodal, single-task, and non-longitudinal methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables.

While Reinforcement Learning (RL) from outcome-based rewards enhances text-based reasoning, understanding how agents autonomously learn to leverage external tools like code execution remains crucial. We investigate RL from outcome-based rewards for Tool-Integrated Reasoning, ZeroTIR, training base LLMs to spontaneously generate and execute Python code for mathematical problems without supervised tool-use examples. Our central contribution is we demonstrate that as RL training progresses, key metrics scale predictably. Specifically, we observe strong positive correlations where increased training steps lead to increases in the spontaneous code execution frequency, the average response length, and, critically, the final task accuracy. This suggests a quantifiable relationship between computational effort invested in training and the emergence of effective, tool-augmented reasoning strategies. We implement a robust framework featuring a decoupled code execution environment and validate our findings across standard RL algorithms and frameworks. Experiments show ZeroTIR significantly surpasses non-tool ZeroRL baselines on challenging math benchmarks. Our findings provide a foundational understanding of how autonomous tool use is acquired and scales within Agent RL, offering a reproducible benchmark for future studies.

| **[Enhancing Sequential Recommender with Large Language Models for Joint Video and Comment Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13574v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, reading or writing comments on captivating videos has emerged as a critical part of the viewing experience on online video platforms. However, existing recommender systems primarily focus on users' interaction behaviors with videos, neglecting comment content and interaction in user preference modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel recommendation approach called LSVCR that utilizes user interaction histories with both videos and comments to jointly perform personalized video and comment recommendation. Specifically, our approach comprises two key components: sequential recommendation (SR) model and supplemental large language model (LLM) recommender. The SR model functions as the primary recommendation backbone (retained in deployment) of our method for efficient user preference modeling. Concurrently, we employ a LLM as the supplemental recommender (discarded in deployment) to better capture underlying user preferences derived from heterogeneous interaction behaviors. In order to integrate the strengths of the SR model and the supplemental LLM recommender, we introduce a two-stage training paradigm. The first stage, personalized preference alignment, aims to align the preference representations from both components, thereby enhancing the semantics of the SR model. The second stage, recommendation-oriented fine-tuning, involves fine-tuning the alignment-enhanced SR model according to specific objectives. Extensive experiments in both video and comment recommendation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of LSVCR. Moreover, online A/B testing on KuaiShou platform verifies the practical benefits of our approach. In particular, we attain a cumulative gain of 4.13% in comment watch time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by RecSys2025</p></details> |

This study investigates how integrating DTs with penetration testing tools and Large Language Models (LLMs) can enhance cybersecurity education and operational readiness. By simulating realistic cyber environments, this approach offers a practical, interactive framework for exploring vulnerabilities and defensive strategies. At the core of this research is the Red Team Knife (RTK), a custom penetration testing toolkit aligned with the Cyber Kill Chain model. RTK is designed to guide learners through key phases of cyberattacks, including reconnaissance, exploitation, and response within a DT powered ecosystem. The incorporation of Large Language Models (LLMs) further enriches the experience by providing intelligent, real-time feedback, natural language threat explanations, and adaptive learning support during training exercises. This combined DT LLM framework is currently being piloted in academic settings to develop hands on skills in vulnerability assessment, threat detection, and security operations. Initial findings suggest that the integration significantly improves the effectiveness and relevance of cybersecurity training, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world application. Ultimately, the research demonstrates how DTs and LLMs together can transform cybersecurity education to meet evolving industry demands.</p></details> |  |
| **[URPO: A Unified Reward & Policy Optimization Framework for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17515v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale alignment pipelines typically pair a policy model with a separately trained reward model whose parameters remain frozen during reinforcement learning (RL). This separation creates a complex, resource-intensive pipeline and suffers from a performance ceiling due to a static reward signal. We propose a novel framework, Unified Reward & Policy Optimization (URPO), that unifies instruction-following ("player") and reward modeling ("referee") within a single model and a single training phase. Our method recasts all alignment data-including preference pairs, verifiable reasoning, and open-ended instructions-into a unified generative format optimized by a single Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) loop. This enables the model to learn from ground-truth preferences and verifiable logic while simultaneously generating its own rewards for open-ended tasks. Experiments on the Qwen2.5-7B model demonstrate URPO's superiority. Our unified model significantly outperforms a strong baseline using a separate generative reward model, boosting the instruction-following score on AlpacaEval from 42.24 to 44.84 and the composite reasoning average from 32.66 to 35.66. Furthermore, URPO cultivates a superior internal evaluator as a byproduct of training, achieving a RewardBench score of 85.15 and surpassing the dedicated reward model it replaces (83.55). By eliminating the need for a separate reward model and fostering a co-evolutionary dynamic between generation and evaluation, URPO presents a simpler, more efficient, and more effective path towards robustly aligned language models.</p></details> |  |

The competition idea is based on two real-life AI security threats identified within the project -- data poisoning and overreliance in Large Language Models. The task is to distinguish between the proper output from LLM and the output generated under malicious modification of the LLM. As this problem was not extensively researched, participants are required to develop new techniques to address this issue or adjust already existing ones to this problem's statement.</p></details> |  |

Evaluating NLI Performance in Basque and Spanish Geographical Variants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15239v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of current language technologies to understand Basque and Spanish language varieties. We use Natural Language Inference (NLI) as a pivot task and introduce a novel, manually-curated parallel dataset in Basque and Spanish, along with their respective variants. Our empirical analysis of crosslingual and in-context learning experiments using encoder-only and decoder-based Large Language Models (LLMs) shows a performance drop when handling linguistic variation, especially in Basque. Error analysis suggests that this decline is not due to lexical overlap, but rather to the linguistic variation itself. Further ablation experiments indicate that encoder-only models particularly struggle with Western Basque, which aligns with linguistic theory that identifies peripheral dialects (e.g., Western) as more distant from the standard. All data and code are publicly available.</p></details> |  |

However, Tibetan, as a representative low-resource language, is particularly underrepresented in existing models due to the scarcity of high-quality training corpora. To address this gap, we curate the largest Tibetan pre-training corpus to date, aggregating data from diverse sources and applying a dedicated data cleaning and processing pipeline tailored for Tibetan. With the curated data, we continue pre/post-training a multilingual base model to enhance its generative capabilities in Tibetan. To evaluate the Tibetan capabilities of the model, we create new high-quality Tibetan benchmarks, and complement them with existing public benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our model consistently and significantly outperforms both open-source models of similar scale and Tibetan-tailored models across a wide range of tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, their performance degrades when handling real-world applications that involve complex multi-image compositions and multi-modal instructions, revealing limitations in cross-image reasoning and generalization. To address these challenges, we adopt a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based post-training strategy to improve the reasoning of MLLMs in multi-image grounding tasks. Our approach begins with synthesizing high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) data for cold-start initialization, followed by supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). The cold-start training stage enables the model to identify correct solutions. Subsequently, we perform rejection sampling using the merged SFT model to curate high-quality RL data and leverage rule-based RL to guide the model toward optimal reasoning paths. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, yielding improvements of +9.04% on MIG-Bench, +6.37% on MC-Bench, and +4.98% on several out-of-domain reasoning grounding benchmarks compared to the SFT baseline. Furthermore, our method exhibits strong generalization in multi-image perception, with gains of +3.1% and +2.4% over the base model on BLINK and MMIU benchmarks, respectively.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Infinite Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09068v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal extensions (MLLMs) have ushered in remarkable progress in video understanding. However, a fundamental challenge persists: effectively processing and comprehending video content that extends beyond minutes or hours. While recent efforts like Video-XL-2 have demonstrated novel architectural solutions for extreme efficiency, and advancements in positional encoding such as HoPE and VideoRoPE++ aim to improve spatio-temporal understanding over extensive contexts, current state-of-the-art models still encounter significant computational and memory constraints when faced with the sheer volume of visual tokens from lengthy sequences. Furthermore, maintaining temporal coherence, tracking complex events, and preserving fine-grained details over extended periods remain formidable hurdles, despite progress in agentic reasoning systems like Deep Video Discovery. This position paper posits that a logical, albeit ambitious, next frontier for multimedia research is Infinite Video Understanding -- the capability for models to continuously process, understand, and reason about video data of arbitrary, potentially never-ending duration. We argue that framing Infinite Video Understanding as a blue-sky research objective provides a vital north star for the multimedia, and the wider AI, research communities, driving innovation in areas such as streaming architectures, persistent memory mechanisms, hierarchical and adaptive representations, event-centric reasoning, and novel evaluation paradigms. Drawing inspiration from recent work on long/ultra-long video understanding and several closely related fields, we outline the core challenges and key research directions towards achieving this transformative capability.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving high-quality alignment with human intent and safety norms without human annotations remains a fundamental challenge. In this work, we propose an Uncertainty-Driven Adaptive Self-Alignment (UDASA) framework designed to improve LLM alignment in a fully automated manner. UDASA first generates multiple responses for each input and quantifies output uncertainty across three dimensions: semantics, factuality, and value alignment. Based on these uncertainty scores, the framework constructs preference pairs and categorizes training samples into three stages, conservative, moderate, and exploratory, according to their uncertainty difference. The model is then optimized progressively across these stages. In addition, we conduct a series of preliminary studies to validate the core design assumptions and provide strong empirical motivation for the proposed framework. Experimental results show that UDASA outperforms existing alignment methods across multiple tasks, including harmlessness, helpfulness, truthfulness, and controlled sentiment generation, significantly improving model performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[MultiNRC: A Challenging and Native Multilingual Reasoning Evaluation Benchmark for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17476v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown rapid improvement on reasoning benchmarks in English, the evaluation of such LLMs' multilingual reasoning capability across diverse languages and cultural contexts remains limited. Existing multilingual reasoning benchmarks are typically constructed by translating existing English reasoning benchmarks, biasing these benchmarks towards reasoning problems with context in English language/cultures. In this work, we introduce the Multilingual Native Reasoning Challenge (MultiNRC), a benchmark designed to assess LLMs on more than 1,000 native, linguistic and culturally grounded reasoning questions written by native speakers in French, Spanish, and Chinese. MultiNRC covers four core reasoning categories: language-specific linguistic reasoning, wordplay & riddles, cultural/tradition reasoning, and math reasoning with cultural relevance. For cultural/tradition reasoning and math reasoning with cultural relevance, we also provide English equivalent translations of the multilingual questions by manual translation from native speakers fluent in English. This set of English equivalents can provide a direct comparison of LLM reasoning capacity in other languages vs. English on the same reasoning questions. We systematically evaluate current 14 leading LLMs covering most LLM families on MultiNRC and its English equivalent set. The results show that (1) current LLMs are still not good at native multilingual reasoning, with none scoring above 50% on MultiNRC; (2) LLMs exhibit distinct strengths and weaknesses in handling linguistic, cultural, and logical reasoning tasks; (3) Most models perform substantially better in math reasoning in English compared to in original languages (+10%), indicating persistent challenges with culturally grounded knowledge.</p></details> |  |

This work presents a novel approach to enhancing complex decision-making workflows through the integration of hierarchical learning alongside various enhancements. Focusing on university admissions as a representative high-stakes domain, we propose BGM-HAN, an enhanced Byte-Pair Encoded, Gated Multi-head Hierarchical Attention Network, designed to effectively model semi-structured applicant data. BGM-HAN captures multi-level representations that are crucial for nuanced assessment, improving both interpretability and predictive performance. Experimental results on real admissions data demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms both state-of-the-art baselines from traditional machine learning to large language models, offering a promising framework for augmenting decision-making in domains where structure, context, and fairness matter.

However, the high cost of data collection and the scarcity of high-quality data severely constrain the generalization and application of embodied intelligence policies like Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Data augmentation is a powerful strategy to overcome data scarcity, but methods for editing 4D multi-view sequential images for manipulation tasks are currently lacking. Thus, we propose ERMV (Editing Robotic Multi-View 4D data), a novel data augmentation framework that efficiently edits an entire multi-view sequence based on single-frame editing and robot state conditions. This task presents three core challenges: (1) maintaining geometric and appearance consistency across dynamic views and long time horizons; (2) expanding the working window with low computational costs; and (3) ensuring the semantic integrity of critical objects like the robot arm. ERMV addresses these challenges through a series of innovations. First, to ensure spatio-temporal consistency in motion blur, we introduce a novel Epipolar Motion-Aware Attention (EMA-Attn) mechanism that learns pixel shift caused by movement before applying geometric constraints. Second, to maximize the editing working window, ERMV pioneers a Sparse Spatio-Temporal (STT) module, which decouples the temporal and spatial views and remodels a single-frame multi-view problem through sparse sampling of the views to reduce computational demands. Third, to alleviate error accumulation, we incorporate a feedback intervention Mechanism, which uses a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to check editing inconsistencies and request targeted expert guidance only when necessary. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ERMV-augmented data significantly boosts the robustness and generalization of VLA models in both simulated and real-world environments.</p></details> |  |

This blurs two distinct cases: (i) an input that is genuinely indeterminate and (ii) a solvable problem that the model fails to resolve. We call this phenomenon Vague Perception. And thus we introduce a framework that quantifies the proportion of Unknown responses attributable to model incapacity and tests whether guided stimulation can convert them into either correct Known or correct Unknown with valid reasoning. By separating these sources of uncertainty, our method provides a clearer picture of LLM reasoning limits and their potential for improvement. As we get a theoretical accuracy of reasoning task on different LLMs, we apply different methods to test whether the model can reach the accuracy given a baseline framework. Our work is meaningful in exploring the potential reasoning ability of LLMs and providing a new perspective on solving the Vague Perception phenomenon.</p></details> |  |

However, their proficiency within the chemistry domain remains restricted, especially in solving molecule-related tasks. This challenge is attributed to their inherent limitations in comprehending molecules using only common textual representations, i.e. SMILES strings. In this study, we seek to enhance the ability of LLMs to comprehend molecules by equipping them with a multi-modal external module, termed MolX. Instead of directly using SMILES strings to represent a molecule, we utilize specific encoders to extract fine-grained features from both SMILES string and 2D molecular graph representations for feeding into an LLM. A hand-crafted molecular fingerprint is incorporated to leverage its embedded domain knowledge. To establish an alignment between MolX and the LLM's textual input space, the model in which the LLM is frozen, is pre-trained with a strategy including a diverse set of tasks. Experimental evaluations show that our proposed method outperforms baselines across 4 downstream molecule-related tasks ranging from molecule-to-text translation to retrosynthesis, with and without fine-tuning the LLM, while only introducing a small number of trainable parameters--0.53\% and 0.82\%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>MLoG-...</summary><p>MLoG-GenAI@KDD '25 (Oral)</p></details> |

This paper introduces Miipher-2, an SR model designed for million-hour scale data, for training data cleaning for large-scale generative models like large language models. Key challenges addressed include generalization to unseen languages, operation without explicit conditioning (e.g., text, speaker ID), and computational efficiency. Miipher-2 utilizes a frozen, pre-trained Universal Speech Model (USM), supporting over 300 languages, as a robust, conditioning-free feature extractor. To optimize efficiency and minimize memory, Miipher-2 incorporates parallel adapters for predicting clean USM features from noisy inputs and employs the WaveFit neural vocoder for waveform synthesis. These components were trained on 3,000 hours of multi-lingual, studio-quality recordings with augmented degradations, while USM parameters remained fixed. Experimental results demonstrate Miipher-2's superior or comparable performance to conventional SR models in word-error-rate, speaker similarity, and both objective and subjective sound quality scores across all tested languages. Miipher-2 operates efficiently on consumer-grade accelerators, achieving a real-time factor of 0.0078, enabling the processing of a million-hour speech dataset in approximately three days using only 100 such accelerators.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE WASPAA2025</p></details> |

Nevertheless, existing methods frequently face limitations in both applicability and explainability. Traditional graph-based and sequence-to-sequence models often lack generalized chemical knowledge, leading to predictions that are neither consistently accurate nor easily explainable. To address these challenges, we introduce RetroDFM-R, a reasoning-based large language model (LLM) designed specifically for chemical retrosynthesis. Leveraging large-scale reinforcement learning guided by chemically verifiable rewards, RetroDFM-R significantly enhances prediction accuracy and explainability. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that RetroDFM-R significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a top-1 accuracy of 65.0% on the USPTO-50K benchmark. Double-blind human assessments further validate the chemical plausibility and practical utility of RetroDFM-R's predictions. RetroDFM-R also accurately predicts multistep retrosynthetic routes reported in the literature for both real-world drug molecules and perovskite materials. Crucially, the model's explicit reasoning process provides human-interpretable insights, thereby enhancing trust and practical value in real-world retrosynthesis applications.</p></details> | Preprint |

Based on our experiments, we found that the effectiveness of jailbreak strategies is influenced by the comprehension ability of the attacked LLM. Building on this insight, we propose a capability-aware Multi-Encryption Framework (MEF) for evaluating vulnerabilities in black-box LLMs. Specifically, MEF first categorizes the comprehension ability level of the LLM, then applies different strategies accordingly: For models with limited comprehension ability, MEF adopts the Fu+En1 strategy, which integrates layered semantic mutations with an encryption technique, more effectively contributing to evasion of the LLM's defenses at the input and inference stages. For models with strong comprehension ability, MEF uses a more complex Fu+En1+En2 strategy, in which additional dual-ended encryption techniques are applied to the LLM's responses, further contributing to evasion of the LLM's defenses at the output stage. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving attack success rates of 98.9% on GPT-4o (29 May 2025 release) and 99.8% on GPT-4.1 (8 July 2025 release). Our work contributes to a deeper understanding of the vulnerabilities in current LLM alignment mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Each to Their Own: Exploring the Optimal Embedding in RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17442v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, as Large Language Models (LLMs) have fundamentally impacted various fields, the methods for incorporating up-to-date information into LLMs or adding external knowledge to construct domain-specific models have garnered wide attention. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), serving as an inference-time scaling method, is notable for its low cost and minimal effort for parameter tuning. However, due to heterogeneous training data and model architecture, the variant embedding models used in RAG exhibit different benefits across various areas, often leading to different similarity calculation results and, consequently, varying response quality from LLMs. To address this problem, we propose and examine two approaches to enhance RAG by combining the benefits of multiple embedding models, named Mixture-Embedding RAG and Confident RAG. Mixture-Embedding RAG simply sorts and selects retrievals from multiple embedding models based on standardized similarity; however, it does not outperform vanilla RAG. In contrast, Confident RAG generates responses multiple times using different embedding models and then selects the responses with the highest confidence level, demonstrating average improvements of approximately 10% and 5% over vanilla LLMs and RAG, respectively. The consistent results across different LLMs and embedding models indicate that Confident RAG is an efficient plug-and-play approach for various domains. We will release our code upon publication.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comprehensive Evaluation on Quantization Techniques for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17417v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For large language models (LLMs), post-training quantization (PTQ) can significantly reduce memory footprint and computational overhead. Model quantization is a rapidly evolving research field. Though many papers have reported breakthrough performance, they may not conduct experiments on the same ground since one quantization method usually contains multiple components. In addition, analyzing the theoretical connections among existing methods is crucial for in-depth understanding. To bridge these gaps, we conduct an extensive review of state-of-the-art methods and perform comprehensive evaluations on the same ground to ensure fair comparisons. To our knowledge, this fair and extensive investigation remains critically important yet underexplored. To better understand the theoretical connections, we decouple the published quantization methods into two steps: pre-quantization transformation and quantization error mitigation. We define the former as a preprocessing step applied before quantization to reduce the impact of outliers, making the data distribution flatter and more suitable for quantization. Quantization error mitigation involves techniques that offset the errors introduced during quantization, thereby enhancing model performance. We evaluate and analyze the impact of different components of quantization methods. Additionally, we analyze and evaluate the latest MXFP4 data format and its performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that optimized rotation and scaling yield the best performance for pre-quantization transformation, and combining low-rank compensation with GPTQ occasionally outperforms using GPTQ alone for quantization error mitigation. Furthermore, we explore the potential of the latest MXFP4 quantization and reveal that the optimal pre-quantization transformation strategy for INT4 does not generalize well to MXFP4, inspiring further investigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explicit Vulnerability Generation with LLMs: An Investigation Beyond Adversarial Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10054v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as code assistants, yet their behavior when explicitly asked to generate insecure code remains poorly understood. While prior research has focused on unintended vulnerabilities, this study examines a more direct threat: open-source LLMs generating vulnerable code when prompted. We propose a dual experimental design: (1) Dynamic Prompting, which systematically varies vulnerability type, user persona, and prompt phrasing across structured templates; and (2) Reverse Prompting, which derives natural-language prompts from real vulnerable code samples. We evaluate three open-source 7B-parameter models (Qwen2, Mistral, Gemma) using static analysis to assess both the presence and correctness of generated vulnerabilities. Our results show that all models frequently generate the requested vulnerabilities, though with significant performance differences. Gemma achieves the highest correctness for memory vulnerabilities under Dynamic Prompting (e.g., 98.6% for buffer overflows), while Qwen2 demonstrates the most balanced performance across all tasks. We find that professional personas (e.g., "DevOps Engineer") consistently elicit higher success rates than student personas, and that the effectiveness of direct versus indirect phrasing is inverted depending on the prompting strategy. Vulnerability reproduction accuracy follows a non-linear pattern with code complexity, peaking in a moderate range. Our findings expose how LLMs' reliance on pattern recall over semantic reasoning creates significant blind spots in their safety alignments, particularly for requests framed as plausible professional tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICSME 2025</p></details> |
| **[HiProbe-VAD: Video Anomaly Detection via Hidden States Probing in Tuning-Free Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17394v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify and locate deviations from normal patterns in video sequences. Traditional methods often struggle with substantial computational demands and a reliance on extensive labeled datasets, thereby restricting their practical applicability. To address these constraints, we propose HiProbe-VAD, a novel framework that leverages pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for VAD without requiring fine-tuning. In this paper, we discover that the intermediate hidden states of MLLMs contain information-rich representations, exhibiting higher sensitivity and linear separability for anomalies compared to the output layer. To capitalize on this, we propose a Dynamic Layer Saliency Probing (DLSP) mechanism that intelligently identifies and extracts the most informative hidden states from the optimal intermediate layer during the MLLMs reasoning. Then a lightweight anomaly scorer and temporal localization module efficiently detects anomalies using these extracted hidden states and finally generate explanations. Experiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets demonstrate that HiProbe-VAD outperforms existing training-free and most traditional approaches. Furthermore, our framework exhibits remarkable cross-model generalization capabilities in different MLLMs without any tuning, unlocking the potential of pre-trained MLLMs for video anomaly detection and paving the way for more practical and scalable solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Investigating Training Data Detection in AI Coders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17389v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in code large language models (CodeLLMs) have made them indispensable tools in modern software engineering. However, these models occasionally produce outputs that contain proprietary or sensitive code snippets, raising concerns about potential non-compliant use of training data, and posing risks to privacy and intellectual property. To ensure responsible and compliant deployment of CodeLLMs, training data detection (TDD) has become a critical task. While recent TDD methods have shown promise in natural language settings, their effectiveness on code data remains largely underexplored. This gap is particularly important given code's structured syntax and distinct similarity criteria compared to natural language. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study of seven state-of-the-art TDD methods on source code data, evaluating their performance across eight CodeLLMs. To support this evaluation, we introduce CodeSnitch, a function-level benchmark dataset comprising 9,000 code samples in three programming languages, each explicitly labeled as either included or excluded from CodeLLM training. Beyond evaluation on the original CodeSnitch, we design targeted mutation strategies to test the robustness of TDD methods under three distinct settings. These mutation strategies are grounded in the well-established Type-1 to Type-4 code clone detection taxonomy. Our study provides a systematic assessment of current TDD techniques for code and offers insights to guide the development of more effective and robust detection methods in the future.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a novel Language-conditioned Open-Vocabulary Mobile Manipulation framework, named LOVMM, incorporating the large language model (LLM) and vision-language model (VLM) to tackle various mobile manipulation tasks in household environments. Our approach is capable of solving various OVMM tasks with free-form natural language instructions (e.g. "toss the food boxes on the office room desk to the trash bin in the corner", and "pack the bottles from the bed to the box in the guestroom"). Extensive experiments simulated in complex household environments show strong zero-shot generalization and multi-task learning abilities of LOVMM. Moreover, our approach can also generalize to multiple tabletop manipulation tasks and achieve better success rates compared to other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | IJCAI 2025 |
| **[Visualising Policy-Reward Interplay to Inform Zeroth-Order Preference Optimisation of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03460v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with first-order methods like back-propagation is computationally intensive. Zeroth-Order (ZO) optimisation uses function evaluations instead of gradients, reducing memory usage, but suffers from slow convergence in high-dimensional models. As a result, ZO research in LLMs has mostly focused on classification, overlooking more complex generative tasks. In this paper, we introduce ZOPrO, a novel ZO algorithm designed for Preference Optimisation in LLMs. We begin by analysing the interplay between policy and reward models during traditional (first-order) Preference Optimisation, uncovering patterns in their relative updates. Guided by these insights, we adapt Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) with a targeted sampling strategy to accelerate convergence. Through experiments on summarisation, machine translation, and conversational assistants, we demonstrate that our method consistently enhances reward signals while achieving convergence times comparable to first-order methods. While it falls short of some state-of-the-art methods, our work is the first to apply Zeroth-Order methods to Preference Optimisation in LLMs, going beyond classification tasks and paving the way for a largely unexplored research direction.

This survey addresses the imperative need for efficient LLM serving methodologies from a machine learning system (MLSys) research perspective, standing at the crux of advanced AI innovations and practical system optimizations. We provide in-depth analysis, covering a spectrum of solutions, ranging from cutting-edge algorithmic modifications to groundbreaking changes in system designs.

| **[DynaSearcher: Dynamic Knowledge Graph Augmented Search Agent via Multi-Reward Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17365v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-step agentic retrieval systems based on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex information search tasks. However, these systems still face significant challenges in practical applications, particularly in generating factually inconsistent intermediate queries and inefficient search trajectories, which can lead to reasoning deviations or redundant computations. To address these issues, we propose DynaSearcher, an innovative search agent enhanced by dynamic knowledge graphs and multi-reward reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, our system leverages knowledge graphs as external structured knowledge to guide the search process by explicitly modeling entity relationships, thereby ensuring factual consistency in intermediate queries and mitigating biases from irrelevant information. Furthermore, we employ a multi-reward RL framework for fine-grained control over training objectives such as retrieval accuracy, efficiency, and response quality. This framework promotes the generation of high-quality intermediate queries and comprehensive final answers, while discouraging unnecessary exploration and minimizing information omissions or redundancy. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art answer accuracy on six multi-hop question answering datasets, matching frontier LLMs while using only small-scale models and limited computational resources. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates strong generalization and robustness across diverse retrieval environments and larger-scale models, highlighting its broad applicability.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures |
| **[R-Stitch: Dynamic Trajectory Stitching for Efficient Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17307v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enhances the problem-solving capabilities of large language models by encouraging step-by-step intermediate reasoning during inference. While effective, CoT introduces substantial computational overhead due to its reliance on autoregressive decoding over long token sequences. Existing acceleration strategies either reduce sequence length through early stopping or compressive reward designs, or improve decoding speed via speculative decoding with smaller models. However, speculative decoding suffers from limited speedup when the agreement between small and large models is low, and fails to exploit the potential advantages of small models in producing concise intermediate reasoning. In this paper, we present R-Stitch, a token-level, confidence-based hybrid decoding framework that accelerates CoT inference by switching between a small language model (SLM) and a large language model (LLM) along the reasoning trajectory. R-Stitch uses the SLM to generate tokens by default and delegates to the LLM only when the SLM's confidence falls below a threshold. This design avoids full-sequence rollback and selectively invokes the LLM on uncertain steps, preserving both efficiency and answer quality. R-Stitch is model-agnostic, training-free, and compatible with standard decoding pipelines. Experiments on math reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that R-Stitch achieves up to 85\% reduction in inference latency with negligible accuracy drop, highlighting its practical effectiveness in accelerating CoT reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Versatile Pathology Co-pilot via Reasoning Enhanced Multimodal Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17303v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for computational pathology, offering unprecedented opportunities to integrate pathological images with language context for comprehensive diagnostic analysis. These models hold particular promise for automating complex tasks that traditionally require expert interpretation of pathologists. However, current MLLM approaches in pathology demonstrate significantly constrained reasoning capabilities, primarily due to their reliance on expensive chain-of-thought annotations. Additionally, existing methods remain limited to simplex application of visual question answering (VQA) at region-of-interest (ROI) level, failing to address the full spectrum of diagnostic needs such as ROI classification, detection, segmentation, whole-slide-image (WSI) classification and VQA in clinical practice. In this study, we present SmartPath-R1, a versatile MLLM capable of simultaneously addressing both ROI-level and WSI-level tasks while demonstrating robust pathological reasoning capability. Our framework combines scale-dependent supervised fine-tuning and task-aware reinforcement fine-tuning, which circumvents the requirement for chain-of-thought supervision by leveraging the intrinsic knowledge within MLLM. Furthermore, SmartPath-R1 integrates multiscale and multitask analysis through a mixture-of-experts mechanism, enabling dynamic processing for diverse tasks. We curate a large-scale dataset comprising 2.3M ROI samples and 188K WSI samples for training and evaluation. Extensive experiments across 72 tasks validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach. This work represents a significant step toward developing versatile, reasoning-enhanced AI systems for precision pathology.</p></details> |  |

However, retrieval noises significantly impact the quality of LLMs' generation, necessitating the development of denoising mechanisms. Previous methods extract evidence straightforwardly without explicit thinking, which risks filtering out key clues and struggles with generalization. To this end, we propose LEAR, which learns to extract rational evidence by (1) explicitly reasoning to identify potential cues within retrieval contents first, and then (2) consciously extracting to avoid omitting any key cues helpful for answering questions. Specifically, we frame evidence reasoning and evidence extraction into one unified response for end-to-end training; apply knowledge token masks for disentanglement to derive reasoning-based and extraction-based answers; and devise three types of verifiable reward functions, including answer, length, and format, to update the model via the policy optimization algorithm. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of LEAR, providing compact and high-quality evidence, improving the accuracy of downstream tasks, and promoting effective application in online RAG systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 Figures, 10 Tables</p></details> |

However, there is limited understanding of how LLM serving benefits from KV\$ caching, where system design decisions like cache eviction policies are highly workload-dependent. In this paper, we present the first systematic characterization of the KV\$ workload patterns from one of the leading LLM service providers. We draw observations that were not covered by previous studies focusing on synthetic workloads, including: KV\$ reuses are skewed across requests, where reuses between single-turn requests are equally important as multi-turn requests; the reuse time and probability are diverse considering all requests, but for a specific request category, the pattern tends to be predictable; and the overall cache size required for an ideal cache hit ratio is moderate. Based on the characterization, we further propose a workload-aware cache eviction policy that improves the serving performance under real-world traces, especially with limited cache capacity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by USENIX ATC'25</p></details> |

Current algorithmic approaches predominantly rely on proxy metrics for indirect assessment, often failing to align with real user perceptions, thus creating a gap. With large language models (LLMs) increasingly revolutionizing evaluation methodologies across various human annotation tasks, we are inspired to explore a core research proposition: Can LLMs effectively simulate human users for serendipity evaluation? To address this question, we conduct a meta-evaluation on two datasets derived from real user studies in the e-commerce and movie domains, focusing on three key aspects: the accuracy of LLMs compared to conventional proxy metrics, the influence of auxiliary data on LLM comprehension, and the efficacy of recently popular multi-LLM techniques. Our findings indicate that even the simplest zero-shot LLMs achieve parity with, or surpass, the performance of conventional metrics. Furthermore, multi-LLM techniques and the incorporation of auxiliary data further enhance alignment with human perspectives. Based on our findings, the optimal evaluation by LLMs yields a Pearson correlation coefficient of 21.5\% when compared to the results of the user study. This research implies that LLMs may serve as potentially accurate and cost-effective evaluators, introducing a new paradigm for serendipity evaluation in recommender systems.</p></details> | RecSys2025 |

| **[Tiny language models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14871v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A prominent achievement of natural language processing (NLP) is its ability to understand and generate meaningful human language. This capability relies on complex feedforward transformer block architectures pre-trained on large language models (LLMs). However, LLM pre-training is currently feasible only for a few dominant companies due to the immense computational resources required, limiting broader research participation. This creates a critical need for more accessible alternatives. In this study, we explore whether tiny language models (TLMs) exhibit the same key qualitative features of LLMs. We demonstrate that TLMs exhibit a clear performance gap between pre-trained and non-pre-trained models across classification tasks, indicating the effectiveness of pre-training, even at a tiny scale. The performance gap increases with the size of the pre-training dataset and with greater overlap between tokens in the pre-training and classification datasets. Furthermore, the classification accuracy achieved by a pre-trained deep TLM architecture can be replicated through a soft committee of multiple, independently pre-trained shallow architectures, enabling low-latency TLMs without affecting classification accuracy. Our results are based on pre-training BERT-6 and variants of BERT-1 on subsets of the Wikipedia dataset and evaluating their performance on FewRel, AGNews, and DBPedia classification tasks. Future research on TLM is expected to further illuminate the mechanisms underlying NLP, especially given that its biologically inspired models suggest that TLMs may be sufficient for children or adolescents to develop language.

While "aha moment" patterns--where models exhibit self-correction through reflection--are often attributed to emergent properties from RL, we first demonstrate that these patterns exist in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) prior to RL training but may not necessarily correlate with improved reasoning performance. Building on these insights, we present a comprehensive study on enhancing multimodal reasoning through a two-stage approach: (1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a cold start with structured chain-of-thought reasoning patterns, followed by (2) reinforcement learning via GRPO to further refine these capabilities. Our extensive experiments show that this combined approach consistently outperforms both SFT-only and RL-only methods across challenging multimodal reasoning benchmarks. The resulting models achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source MLLMs at both 3B and 7B scales, with our 7B model showing substantial improvements over base models (e.g., 66.3 %$\rightarrow$73.4 % on MathVista, 62.9 %$\rightarrow$70.4 % on We-Math) and our 3B model achieving performance competitive with several 7B models. Overall, this work provides practical guidance for building advanced multimodal reasoning models. Our code is available at https://github.com/waltonfuture/RL-with-Cold-Start.</p></details> |  |

Researchers typically employ process-supervised reward models (PRMs) to guide the reasoning process, effectively improving the models' reasoning abilities. However, existing methods for constructing process supervision training data, such as manual annotation and per-step Monte Carlo estimation, are often costly or suffer from poor quality. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a framework called EpicPRM, which annotates each intermediate reasoning step based on its quantified contribution and uses an adaptive binary search algorithm to enhance both annotation precision and efficiency. Using this approach, we efficiently construct a high-quality process supervision training dataset named Epic50k, consisting of 50k annotated intermediate steps. Compared to other publicly available datasets, the PRM trained on Epic50k demonstrates significantly superior performance. Getting Epic50k at https://github.com/xiaolizh1/EpicPRM.</p></details> |  |

Our framework integrates Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents to analyze complex Discrete Event Simulation (DES) output data from warehouse operations. It transforms raw DES data into a semantically rich KG, capturing relationships between simulation events and entities. An LLM-based agent uses iterative reasoning, generating interdependent sub-questions. For each sub-question, it creates Cypher queries for KG interaction, extracts information, and self-reflects to correct errors. This adaptive, iterative, and self-correcting process identifies operational issues mimicking human analysis. Our DES approach for warehouse bottleneck identification, tested with equipment breakdowns and process irregularities, outperforms baseline methods. For operational questions, it achieves near-perfect pass rates in pinpointing inefficiencies. For complex investigative questions, we demonstrate its superior diagnostic ability to uncover subtle, interconnected issues. This work bridges simulation modeling and AI (KG+LLM), offering a more intuitive method for actionable insights, reducing time-to-insight, and enabling automated warehouse inefficiency evaluation and diagnosis.</p></details> | 12 pages, 2 figures |

Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches have significantly improved automated test generation, garnering attention from both academia and industry. We revisit LLM-based unit test generation from a novel perspective by decoupling prefix generation and assertion generation. To characterize their respective challenges, we define Initialization Complexity and adopt Cyclomatic Complexity to measure the difficulty of prefix and assertion generation, revealing that the former primarily affects compilation success, while the latter influences test coverage. To address these challenges, we propose Seed&Steer, a two-step approach that combines traditional unit testing techniques with the capabilities of large language models. Seed&Steer leverages conventional unit testing tools (e.g., EvoSuite) to generate method invocations with high compilation success rates, which serve as seeds to guide LLMs in constructing effective test contexts. It then introduces branching cues to help LLMs explore diverse execution paths (e.g., normal, boundary, and exception cases) and generate assertions with high coverage. We evaluate Seed&Steer on five real-world Java projects against state-of-the-art baselines. Results show that Seed&Steer improves the compilation pass rate by approximately 7%, successfully compiling 792 and 887 previously failing cases on two LLMs. It also achieves up to ~73% branch and line coverage across focal methods of varying complexity, with coverage improvements ranging from 1.09* to 1.26*. Our code, dataset, and experimental scripts will be publicly released to support future research and reproducibility.</p></details> |  |

The process of prompt programming requires the developer to make many changes to their prompt. Yet, the questions developers ask to update their prompt is unknown, despite the answers to these questions affecting how developers plan their changes. With the growing number of research and commercial prompt programming tools, it is unclear whether prompt programmers' needs are being adequately addressed. We address these challenges by developing a taxonomy of 25 tasks prompt programmers do and 51 questions they ask, measuring the importance of each task and question. We interview 16 prompt programmers, observe 8 developers make prompt changes, and survey 50 developers. We then compare the taxonomy with 48 research and commercial tools. We find that prompt programming is not well-supported: all tasks are done manually, and 16 of the 51 questions -- including a majority of the most important ones -- remain unanswered. Based on this, we outline important opportunities for prompt programming tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tab-MIA: A Benchmark Dataset for Membership Inference Attacks on Tabular Data in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17259v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained on tabular data, which, unlike unstructured text, often contains personally identifiable information (PII) in a highly structured and explicit format. As a result, privacy risks arise, since sensitive records can be inadvertently retained by the model and exposed through data extraction or membership inference attacks (MIAs). While existing MIA methods primarily target textual content, their efficacy and threat implications may differ when applied to structured data, due to its limited content, diverse data types, unique value distributions, and column-level semantics. In this paper, we present Tab-MIA, a benchmark dataset for evaluating MIAs on tabular data in LLMs and demonstrate how it can be used. Tab-MIA comprises five data collections, each represented in six different encoding formats. Using our Tab-MIA benchmark, we conduct the first evaluation of state-of-the-art MIA methods on LLMs finetuned with tabular data across multiple encoding formats. In the evaluation, we analyze the memorization behavior of pretrained LLMs on structured data derived from Wikipedia tables. Our findings show that LLMs memorize tabular data in ways that vary across encoding formats, making them susceptible to extraction via MIAs. Even when fine-tuned for as few as three epochs, models exhibit high vulnerability, with AUROC scores approaching 90% in most cases. Tab-MIA enables systematic evaluation of these risks and provides a foundation for developing privacy-preserving methods for tabular data in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agent Identity Evals: Measuring Agentic Identity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17257v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Central to agentic capability and trustworthiness of language model agents (LMAs) is the extent they maintain stable, reliable, identity over time. However, LMAs inherit pathologies from large language models (LLMs) (statelessness, stochasticity, sensitivity to prompts and linguistically-intermediation) which can undermine their identifiability, continuity, persistence and consistency. This attrition of identity can erode their reliability, trustworthiness and utility by interfering with their agentic capabilities such as reasoning, planning and action. To address these challenges, we introduce \textit{agent identity evals} (AIE), a rigorous, statistically-driven, empirical framework for measuring the degree to which an LMA system exhibit and maintain their agentic identity over time, including their capabilities, properties and ability to recover from state perturbations. AIE comprises a set of novel metrics which can integrate with other measures of performance, capability and agentic robustness to assist in the design of optimal LMA infrastructure and scaffolding such as memory and tools. We set out formal definitions and methods that can be applied at each stage of the LMA life-cycle, and worked examples of how to apply them.</p></details> |  |
| **[R4ec: A Reasoning, Reflection, and Refinement Framework for Recommendation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17249v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Harnessing Large Language Models (LLMs) for recommendation systems has emerged as a prominent avenue, drawing substantial research interest. However, existing approaches primarily involve basic prompt techniques for knowledge acquisition, which resemble System-1 thinking. This makes these methods highly sensitive to errors in the reasoning path, where even a small mistake can lead to an incorrect inference. To this end, in this paper, we propose $R^{4}$ec, a reasoning, reflection and refinement framework that evolves the recommendation system into a weak System-2 model. Specifically, we introduce two models: an actor model that engages in reasoning, and a reflection model that judges these responses and provides valuable feedback. Then the actor model will refine its response based on the feedback, ultimately leading to improved responses. We employ an iterative reflection and refinement process, enabling LLMs to facilitate slow and deliberate System-2-like thinking. Ultimately, the final refined knowledge will be incorporated into a recommendation backbone for prediction. We conduct extensive experiments on Amazon-Book and MovieLens-1M datasets to demonstrate the superiority of $R^{4}$ec. We also deploy $R^{4}$ec on a large scale online advertising platform, showing 2.2\% increase of revenue. Furthermore, we investigate the scaling properties of the actor model and reflection model.</p></details> | Accepted by Recsys25 |

While some prior works have explored this issue in the context of LLMs, it presents a unique challenge for MLLMs due to the entangled nature of knowledge across modalities, making comprehensive unlearning more difficult. To address this challenge, we propose Modality Aware Neuron Unlearning (MANU), a novel unlearning framework for MLLMs designed to selectively clip neurons based on their relative importance to the targeted forget data, curated for different modalities. Specifically, MANU consists of two stages: important neuron selection and selective pruning. The first stage identifies and collects the most influential neurons across modalities relative to the targeted forget knowledge, while the second stage is dedicated to pruning those selected neurons. MANU effectively isolates and removes the neurons that contribute most to the forget data within each modality, while preserving the integrity of retained knowledge. Our experiments conducted across various MLLM architectures illustrate that MANU can achieve a more balanced and comprehensive unlearning in each modality without largely affecting the overall model utility.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

However, relying solely on prompts and contextual inputs often proves insufficient for achieving deep immersion in specific roles, particularly well-known fictional or public figures. On the other hand, fine-tuning-based approaches face limitations due to the challenges associated with data collection and the computational resources required for training, thereby restricting their broader applicability. To address these issues, we propose Test-Time-Matching (TTM), a training-free role-playing framework through test-time scaling and context engineering. TTM uses LLM agents to automatically decouple a character's features into personality, memory, and linguistic style. Our framework involves a structured, three-stage generation pipeline that utilizes these features for controlled role-playing. It achieves high-fidelity role-playing performance, also enables seamless combinations across diverse linguistic styles and even variations in personality and memory. We evaluate our framework through human assessment, and the results demonstrate that our method achieves the outstanding performance in generating expressive and stylistically consistent character dialogues.</p></details> |  |

A critical bottleneck arises as KV cache and attention computations scale rapidly with text length, challenging deployment on hardware with limited computational and memory resources. We observe that attention mechanisms exhibit substantial redundancy, since the KV cache can be significantly compressed and attention maps across heads display high similarity, revealing that much of the computation and storage is unnecessary. Leveraging these insights, we propose \textbf{G}rouped-Head Laten\textbf{T} \textbf{A}ttention (GTA), a novel attention mechanism that reduces memory usage and computational complexity while maintaining performance. GTA comprises two components: (1) a shared attention map mechanism that reuses attention scores across multiple heads, decreasing the key cache size; and (2) a nonlinear value decoder with learned projections that compresses the value cache into a latent space, further cutting memory needs. GTA cuts attention computation FLOPs by up to \emph{62.5\%} versus Grouped-Query Attention and shrink the KV cache by up to \emph{70\%}, all while avoiding the extra overhead of Multi-Head Latent Attention to improve LLM deployment efficiency. Consequently, GTA models achieve a \emph{2x} increase in end-to-end inference speed, with prefill benefiting from reduced computational cost and decoding benefiting from the smaller cache footprint.</p></details> |  |

In the context of cooking recipes, this poses a challenge, as intermediate states of ingredients are often omitted, making it difficult for models to track ingredient states and understand recipes accurately. In this paper, we apply state probing, a method for evaluating a language model's understanding of the world, to the domain of cooking. We propose a new task and dataset for evaluating how well LLMs can recognize intermediate ingredient states during cooking procedures. We first construct a new Japanese recipe dataset with clear and accurate annotations of ingredient state changes, collected from well-structured and controlled recipe texts. Using this dataset, we design three novel tasks to evaluate whether LLMs can track ingredient state transitions and identify ingredients present at intermediate steps. Our experiments with widely used LLMs, such as Llama3.1-70B and Qwen2.5-72B, show that learning ingredient state knowledge improves their understanding of cooking processes, achieving performance comparable to commercial LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM Multimedia 2025</p></details> |

Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, are transforming task planning by offering natural language as an intuitive and flexible way to describe tasks, generate symbolic plans, and reason. However, the effectiveness of LLM-based TAMP approaches is limited due to static and template-based prompting, which limits adaptability to dynamic environments and complex task contexts. To address these limitations, this work proposes a novel Onto-LLM-TAMP framework that employs knowledge-based reasoning to refine and expand user prompts with task-contextual reasoning and knowledge-based environment state descriptions. Integrating domain-specific knowledge into the prompt ensures semantically accurate and context-aware task plans. The proposed framework demonstrates its effectiveness by resolving semantic errors in symbolic plan generation, such as maintaining logical temporal goal ordering in scenarios involving hierarchical object placement. The proposed framework is validated through both simulation and real-world scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements over the baseline approach in terms of adaptability to dynamic environments and the generation of semantically correct task plans.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to knowledge based systems</p></details> |
| **[The Pluralistic Moral Gap: Understanding Judgment and Value Differences between Humans and Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17216v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>People increasingly rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) for moral advice, which may influence humans' decisions. Yet, little is known about how closely LLMs align with human moral judgments. To address this, we introduce the Moral Dilemma Dataset, a benchmark of 1,618 real-world moral dilemmas paired with a distribution of human moral judgments consisting of a binary evaluation and a free-text rationale. We treat this problem as a pluralistic distributional alignment task, comparing the distributions of LLM and human judgments across dilemmas. We find that models reproduce human judgments only under high consensus; alignment deteriorates sharply when human disagreement increases. In parallel, using a 60-value taxonomy built from 3,783 value expressions extracted from rationales, we show that LLMs rely on a narrower set of moral values than humans. These findings reveal a pluralistic moral gap: a mismatch in both the distribution and diversity of values expressed. To close this gap, we introduce Dynamic Moral Profiling (DMP), a Dirichlet-based sampling method that conditions model outputs on human-derived value profiles. DMP improves alignment by 64.3% and enhances value diversity, offering a step toward more pluralistic and human-aligned moral guidance from LLMs.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |

Traditional hypothesis-driven research, though effective, is constrained by human cognitive limits, the complexity of biological systems, and the high cost of trial-and-error experimentation. Deep learning models, especially graph neural networks (GNNs), have accelerated prediction generation, but the sheer volume of outputs makes manual selection for validation unscalable. Large language models (LLMs) offer promise in filtering and hypothesis generation, yet suffer from hallucinations and lack grounding in structured knowledge, limiting their reliability. To address these issues, we propose HypoChainer, a collaborative visualization framework that integrates human expertise, LLM-driven reasoning, and knowledge graphs (KGs) to enhance hypothesis generation and validation. HypoChainer operates in three stages: First, exploration and contextualization -- experts use retrieval-augmented LLMs (RAGs) and dimensionality reduction to navigate large-scale GNN predictions, assisted by interactive explanations. Second, hypothesis chain formation -- experts iteratively examine KG relationships around predictions and semantically linked entities, refining hypotheses with LLM and KG suggestions. Third, validation prioritization -- refined hypotheses are filtered based on KG-supported evidence to identify high-priority candidates for experimentation, with visual analytics further strengthening weak links in reasoning. We demonstrate HypoChainer's effectiveness through case studies in two domains and expert interviews, highlighting its potential to support interpretable, scalable, and knowledge-grounded scientific discovery.</p></details> |  |

However, a holistic representation of an individual goes beyond surface-level facts or conversations to deeper thoughts and thinking. In this work, we introduce CharacterBot, a model designed to replicate both the linguistic patterns and distinctive thought processes of a character. Using Lu Xun, a renowned Chinese writer, as a case study, we propose four training tasks derived from his 17 essay collections. These include a pre-training task focused on mastering external linguistic structures and knowledge, as well as three fine-tuning tasks: multiple-choice question answering, generative question answering, and style transfer, each aligning the LLM with Lu Xun's internal ideation and writing style. To optimize learning across these tasks, we introduce a CharLoRA parameter updating mechanism, where a general linguistic style expert collaborates with other task-specific experts to better study both the language style and the understanding of deeper thoughts. We evaluate CharacterBot on three tasks for linguistic accuracy and opinion comprehension, demonstrating that it significantly outperforms the baselines on our adapted metrics. We hope that this work inspires future research on deep character persona simulation LLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 3 figures, ACL 2025 Findings</p></details> |

However, in most existing methods for LLM alignment, all tokens in the response are optimized using a sparse, response-level reward or preference annotation. The ignorance of token-level rewards may erroneously punish high-quality tokens or encourage low-quality tokens, resulting in suboptimal performance and slow convergence speed. To address this issue, we propose AlignDistil, an RLHF-equivalent distillation method for token-level reward optimization. Specifically, we introduce the reward learned by DPO into the RLHF objective and theoretically prove the equivalence between this objective and a token-level distillation process, where the teacher distribution linearly combines the logits from the DPO model and a reference model. On this basis, we further bridge the accuracy gap between the reward from the DPO model and the pure reward model, by building a contrastive DPO reward with a normal and a reverse DPO model. Moreover, to avoid under- and over-optimization on different tokens, we design a token adaptive logit extrapolation mechanism to construct an appropriate teacher distribution for each token. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our AlignDistil over existing methods and showcase fast convergence due to its token-level distributional reward optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 Main Conference, code available at: https://github.com/songmzhang/AlignDistil</p></details> |

However, achieving effective coordination in distributed multi-agent environments remains challenging due to (1) misalignment between instructions and task requirements and (2) inconsistency in robot behaviors when they independently interpret ambiguous instructions. To address these challenges, we propose Instruction-Conditioned Coordinator (ICCO), a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework designed to enhance coordination in language-guided multi-robot systems. ICCO consists of a Coordinator agent and multiple Local Agents, where the Coordinator generates Task-Aligned and Consistent Instructions (TACI) by integrating language instructions with environmental states, ensuring task alignment and behavioral consistency. The Coordinator and Local Agents are jointly trained to optimize a reward function that balances task efficiency and instruction following. A Consistency Enhancement Term is added to the learning objective to maximize mutual information between instructions and robot behaviors, further improving coordination. Simulation and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of ICCO in achieving language-guided task-aligned multi-robot control. The demonstration can be found at https://yanoyoshiki.github.io/ICCO/.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, to be published in the 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems</p></details> |

While traditional video classification models effectively handle well-defined moderation tasks, they struggle with complicated scenarios such as implicit harmful content and contextual ambiguity. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer a promising solution to these limitations with their superior cross-modal reasoning and contextual understanding. However, two key challenges hinder their industrial adoption. First, the high computational cost of MLLMs makes full-scale deployment impractical. Second, adapting generative models for discriminative classification remains an open research problem. In this paper, we first introduce an efficient method to transform a generative MLLM into a multimodal classifier using minimal discriminative training data. To enable industry-scale deployment, we then propose a router-ranking cascade system that integrates MLLMs with a lightweight router model. Offline experiments demonstrate that our MLLM-based approach improves F1 score by 66.50% over traditional classifiers while requiring only 2% of the fine-tuning data. Online evaluations show that our system increases automatic content moderation volume by 41%, while the cascading deployment reduces computational cost to only 1.5% of direct full-scale deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera Ready for ACL 2025</p></details> |

Numerous automated tools can suggest layouts and color schemes, yet often lack the ability to refine their own output, which is a key aspect in real-world workflows. We propose DesignLab, which separates the design process into two roles, the design reviewer, who identifies design-related issues, and the design contributor who corrects them. This decomposition enables an iterative loop where the reviewer continuously detects issues and the contributor corrects them, allowing a draft to be further polished with each iteration, reaching qualities that were unattainable. We fine-tune large language models for these roles and simulate intermediate drafts by introducing controlled perturbations, enabling the design reviewer learn design errors and the contributor learn how to fix them. Our experiments show that DesignLab outperforms existing design-generation methods, including a commercial tool, by embracing the iterative nature of designing which can result in polished, professional slides.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://yeolj00.github.io/personal-projects/designlab</p></details> |

Unlike prior studies that assume uniform UAV capabilities or overlook energy-security trade-offs, we consider a realistic scenario where UAVs with diverse payloads and computation resources collaborate to serve ground terminals in the presence of eavesdroppers. To manage the complex coupling between UAV motion and communication, we propose a hierarchical optimization framework. The inner layer uses a semidefinite relaxation (SDR)-based S2DC algorithm combining penalty functions and difference-of-convex (d.c.) programming to solve the secrecy precoding problem with fixed UAV positions. The outer layer introduces a Large Language Model (LLM)-guided heuristic multi-agent reinforcement learning approach (LLM-HeMARL) for trajectory optimization. LLM-HeMARL efficiently incorporates expert heuristics policy generated by the LLM, enabling UAVs to learn energy-aware, security-driven trajectories without the inference overhead of real-time LLM calls. The simulation results show that our method outperforms existing baselines in secrecy rate and energy efficiency, with consistent robustness across varying UAV swarm sizes and random seeds.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing</p></details> |

Therefore, we aim to propose a more comprehensive and rigorous structured knowledge understanding benchmark to diagnose the shortcomings of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce SKA-Bench, a Structured Knowledge Augmented QA Benchmark that encompasses four widely used structured knowledge forms: KG, Table, KG+Text, and Table+Text. We utilize a three-stage pipeline to construct SKA-Bench instances, which includes a question, an answer, positive knowledge units, and noisy knowledge units. To evaluate the SK understanding capabilities of LLMs in a fine-grained manner, we expand the instances into four fundamental ability testbeds: Noise Robustness, Order Insensitivity, Information Integration, and Negative Rejection. Empirical evaluations on 8 representative LLMs, including the advanced DeepSeek-R1, indicate that existing LLMs still face significant challenges in understanding structured knowledge, and their performance is influenced by factors such as the amount of noise, the order of knowledge units, and hallucination phenomenon.

However, current methods often rely on a fixed number of agents and static communication structures, limiting their ability to adapt to varying task complexities. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Graph Pruning (AGP), a novel task-adaptive multi-agent collaboration framework that jointly optimizes agent quantity (hard-pruning) and communication topology (soft-pruning). Specifically, our method employs a two-stage training strategy: firstly, independently training soft-pruning networks for different agent quantities to determine optimal agent-quantity-specific complete graphs and positional masks across specific tasks; and then jointly optimizing hard-pruning and soft-pruning within a maximum complete graph to dynamically configure the number of agents and their communication topologies per task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach is: (1) High-performing, achieving state-of-the-art results across six benchmarks and consistently generalizes across multiple mainstream LLM architectures, with a increase in performance of $2.58\%\sim 9.84\%$; (2) Task-adaptive, dynamically constructing optimized communication topologies tailored to specific tasks, with an extremely high performance in all three task categories (general reasoning, mathematical reasoning, and code generation); (3) Token-economical, having fewer training steps and token consumption at the same time, with a decrease in token consumption of $90\%+$; and (4) Training-efficient, achieving high performance with very few training steps compared with other methods. The performance will surpass the existing baselines after about ten steps of training under six benchmarks.</p></details> | ECAI 2025 |

Domain-specific continued pretraining (CPT) methods, such as those tailored for mathematical reasoning, have shown promise but lack transferability to broader reasoning tasks. In this work, we pioneer the use of Graph Problem Reasoning (GPR) to enhance the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs. GPR tasks, spanning pathfinding, network analysis, numerical computation, and topological reasoning, require sophisticated logical and relational reasoning, making them ideal for teaching diverse reasoning patterns. To achieve this, we introduce GraphPile, the first large-scale corpus specifically designed for CPT using GPR data. Spanning 10.9 billion tokens across 23 graph tasks, the dataset includes chain-of-thought, program-of-thought, trace of execution, and real-world graph data. Using GraphPile, we train GraphMind on popular base models Llama 3 and 3.1, as well as Gemma 2, achieving up to 4.9 percent higher accuracy in mathematical reasoning and up to 21.2 percent improvement in non-mathematical reasoning tasks such as logical and commonsense reasoning. By being the first to harness GPR for enhancing reasoning patterns and introducing the first dataset of its kind, our work bridges the gap between domain-specific pretraining and universal reasoning capabilities, advancing the adaptability and robustness of LLMs.</p></details> | COLM2025 |

Despite the increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate software engineering tasks, their ability to generate CI configurations remains underexplored. This paper presents a preliminary study evaluating six LLMs for generating GitHub Actions configurations from natural language descriptions. We assess three general-purpose foundation models (GPT-4o, Llama, and Gemma) and three code-pretrained models (GPT-4.1, Code Llama, and CodeGemma). We also introduce the first labeled dataset of its kind, constructed from GitHub Actions documentation, pairing descriptions with corresponding best-practice YAML configurations. Zero-shot prompting achieves up to 69% similarity with the ground truth, with only 3% perfect matches. Code-pretrained models slightly underperform compared to general-purpose ones in YAML-based CI tasks, revealing LLM limitations for CI configuration generation. Analyzing GPT-4o outputs reveals issues like missing or renamed steps, misinterpreted descriptions, and unnecessary additions that may affect structural and contextual correctness, indicating a gap between generation quality and the precision required for executable CI configurations. Our research offers insights for improving LLM alignment with configuration languages and guiding future efforts on CI automation and tooling support.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 41st IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution 2025 (ICSME'25)</p></details> |

This paper presents a novel hybrid framework that integrates blockchain technology with a decentralized, large language model (LLM) powered multi-agent negotiation system to enhance the resilience and accountability of medical supply chains during crises. In this system, autonomous agents-representing manufacturers, distributors, and healthcare institutions-engage in structured, context-aware negotiation and decision-making processes facilitated by LLMs, enabling rapid and ethical allocation of scarce medical resources. The off-chain agent layer supports adaptive reasoning and local decision-making, while the on-chain blockchain layer ensures immutable, transparent, and auditable enforcement of decisions via smart contracts. The framework also incorporates a formal cross-layer communication protocol to bridge decentralized negotiation with institutional enforcement. A simulation environment emulating pandemic scenarios evaluates the system's performance, demonstrating improvements in negotiation efficiency, fairness of allocation, supply chain responsiveness, and auditability. This research contributes an innovative approach that synergizes blockchain trust guarantees with the adaptive intelligence of LLM-driven agents, providing a robust and scalable solution for critical supply chain coordination under uncertainty.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figure |

Despite these advantages, existing systems still face issues of low efficiency due to static model placement and lack of dynamic workloads adaptation. This leads to suboptimal resource utilization and increased latency, especially during bursty requests periods. To address these challenges, this paper introduces BrownoutServe, a novel serving framework designed to optimize inference efficiency and maintain service reliability for MoE-based LLMs under dynamic computational demands and traffic conditions. BrownoutServe introduces "united experts" that integrate knowledge from multiple experts, reducing the times of expert access and inference latency. Additionally, it proposes a dynamic brownout mechanism to adaptively adjust the processing of certain tokens, optimizing inference performance while guaranteeing service level objectives (SLOs) are met. Our evaluations show the effectiveness of BrownoutServe under various workloads: it achieves up to 2.07x throughput improvement compared to vLLM and reduces SLO violations by 90.28%, showcasing its robustness under bursty traffic while maintaining acceptable inference accuracy.</p></details> | 12 pages |

Current approaches, like offline fine-tuning and standard prompting, are insufficient because they cannot effectively adapt to new knowledge during actual operation. To address this limitation, we propose the Adaptive Reflective Interactive Agent (ARIA), an LLM agent framework designed specifically to continuously learn updated domain knowledge at test time. ARIA assesses its own uncertainty through structured self-dialogue, proactively identifying knowledge gaps and requesting targeted explanations or corrections from human experts. It then systematically updates an internal, timestamped knowledge repository with provided human guidance, detecting and resolving conflicting or outdated knowledge through comparisons and clarification queries. We evaluate ARIA on the realistic customer due diligence name screening task on TikTok Pay, alongside publicly available dynamic knowledge tasks.

Linear recurrent models have proven to be a viable competitor due to their computational efficiency. However, such models still demonstrate a sizable gap compared to Transformers in terms of in-context learning among other tasks that require recalling information from a context. In this work, we introduce Resona, a simple and scalable framework for augmenting linear recurrent models with retrieval. Resona augments models with the ability to integrate retrieved information from the provided input context, enabling tailored behavior to diverse task requirements. Experiments on a variety of linear recurrent models demonstrate that Resona-augmented models observe significant performance gains on a variety of synthetic as well as real-world natural language tasks, highlighting its ability to act as a general purpose method to improve the in-context learning and language modeling abilities of linear recurrent LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Second Conference on Language Modeling</p></details> |

In this comprehensive survey, we systematically elucidate the foundational principles and technical frameworks of ECI, proposing a novel classification framework to categorize and clarify existing methods. {We discuss associated challenges, provide quantitative evaluations, and outline future directions for this dynamic and rapidly evolving field. We first delineate key definitions, problem formalization, and evaluation protocols of ECI. Our classification framework organizes ECI methods based on two primary tasks: Sentence-level Event Causality Identification (SECI) and Document-level Event Causality Identification (DECI). For SECI, we review methods including feature pattern-based matching, machine learning-based classification, deep semantic encoding, prompt-based fine-tuning, and causal knowledge pre-training, alongside common data augmentation strategies. For DECI, we focus on techniques such as deep semantic encoding, event graph reasoning, and prompt-based fine-tuning. We dedicate specific discussions to advancements in multi-lingual and cross-lingual ECI as well as zero-shot ECI leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). Furthermore, we analyze the strengths, limitations, and unresolved challenges of each method. Extensive quantitative evaluations are conducted on four benchmark datasets to assess various ECI methods. Finally, we explore future research directions.</p></details> |  |
| **[DistFlow: A Fully Distributed RL Framework for Scalable and Efficient LLM Post-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13833v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has become the pivotal post-training technique for large language model. Effectively scaling reinforcement learning is now the key to unlocking advanced reasoning capabilities and ensuring safe, goal-aligned behavior in the most powerful LLMs. Mainstream frameworks usually employ a hybrid-controller architecture where a single-controller dispatches the overall execution logic and manages overall data transfer and the multi-controller executes distributed computation. For large-scale reinforcement learning, minor load imbalances can introduce significant bottlenecks, ultimately constraining the scalability of the system. To address this limitation, we introduce DistFlow, a novel, fully distributed RL framework designed to break scaling barrier. We adopt a multi-controller paradigm that dispatches data transfer and execution tasks to all workers, which eliminates the centralized node. This allows each worker to operate independently, leading to near-linear scalability up to thousands of GPUs and dramatic efficiency gains. Furthermore, our architecture decouples resource configuration from execution logic, allowing each worker to have a unique execution flow, offering significant flexibility for rapid and cost-effective algorithmic experimentation. Extensive experiments show that DistFlow achieves excellent linear scalability and up to a 7x end-to-end throughput improvement over state-of-the-art (SOTA) frameworks.</p></details> |  |

However, the inference of LLMs is resource-intensive or latency-sensitive, posing significant challenges for serving systems. Existing LLM serving systems often use static or continuous batching strategies, which can lead to inefficient GPU memory utilization and increased latency, especially under heterogeneous workloads. These methods may also struggle to adapt to dynamic workload fluctuations, resulting in suboptimal throughput and potential service level objective (SLO) violations. In this paper, we introduce BucketServe, a bucket-based dynamic batching framework designed to optimize LLM inference performance. By grouping requests into size-homogeneous buckets based on sequence length, BucketServe minimizes padding overhead and optimizes GPU memory usage through real-time batch size adjustments preventing out-of-memory (OOM) errors. It introduces adaptive bucket splitting/merging and priority-aware scheduling to mitigate resource fragmentation and ensure SLO compliance. Experiment shows that BucketServe significantly outperforms UELLM in throughput, achieving up to 3.58x improvement. It can also handle 1.93x more request load under the SLO attainment of 80% compared with DistServe and demonstrates 1.975x higher system load capacity compared to the UELLM.</p></details> | 9 pages |

The architecture of recent autonomous systems are trending toward end-to-end (E2E) monolithic architectures such as large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs). In this paper, we review different architectural solutions and then evaluate the efficacy of common safety analyses such as failure modes and effect analysis (FMEA) and fault tree analysis (FTA). We show how these techniques can be improved for the intricate nature of the foundational models, particularly in how they form and utilize latent representations. We introduce HySAFE-AI, Hybrid Safety Architectural Analysis Framework for AI Systems, a hybrid framework that adapts traditional methods to evaluate the safety of AI systems. Lastly, we offer hints of future work and suggestions to guide the evolution of future AI safety standards.</p></details> | 7 pages |

We address this critical weak-to-strong (W2S) generalization challenge by proposing a novel method aimed at improving weak experts, by training on the same limited human-level data, enabling them to generalize to complex, super-human-level tasks. Our approach, called **EnsemW2S**, employs a token-level ensemble strategy that iteratively combines multiple weak experts, systematically addressing the shortcomings identified in preceding iterations. By continuously refining these weak models, we significantly enhance their collective ability to supervise stronger student models. We extensively evaluate the generalization performance of both the ensemble of weak experts and the subsequent strong student model across in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. For OOD, we specifically introduce question difficulty as an additional dimension for defining distributional shifts. Our empirical results demonstrate notable improvements, achieving 4%, and 3.2% improvements on ID datasets and, upto 6% and 2.28% on OOD datasets for experts and student models respectively, underscoring the effectiveness of our proposed method in advancing W2S generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>super...</summary><p>superalignment, weak-to-strong generalization on unseen OOD task; formerly appeared as arXiv:2505.21959v1 which was uploaded as a new submission in error</p></details> |

While it is often assumed that RL fine-tuning requires updating most of a model's parameters, we challenge this assumption with a surprising finding: RL fine-tuning consistently modifies only a small subnetwork (typically 5-30% of weights), leaving most parameters unchanged. We call this phenomenon RL-induced parameter update sparsity. It arises naturally, without any sparsity constraints or parameter-efficient tuning, and appears across multiple RL algorithms (e.g., PPO, DPO, SimPO, PRIME) and model families (e.g., OpenAI, Meta, and open-source LLMs). Moreover, the subnetworks updated by RL show substantial overlap across different seeds, datasets, and algorithms-far exceeding chance-suggesting a partially transferable structure in the pretrained model. We show that fine-tuning only this sparse subnetwork recovers full model performance and yields parameters nearly identical to the fully fine-tuned model. Our analysis suggests this sparsity emerges because RL operates near the model's original distribution, requiring only targeted changes. KL penalties, gradient clipping, and on-policy dynamics have limited effect on the sparsity pattern. These findings shed new light on how RL adapts models: not by shifting all weights, but by focusing training on a small, consistently updated subnetwork. This insight enables more efficient RL methods and reframes sparsity through the lens of the lottery ticket hypothesis.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |

Despite the success of knowledge resources like WordNet, ConceptNet, Wolfram|Alpha and other commercial knowledge graphs, verifiable, general-purpose widely available sources of knowledge remain a critical deficiency in AI infrastructure. Large language models struggle due to knowledge gaps; robotic planning lacks necessary world knowledge; and the detection of factually false information relies heavily on human expertise. What kind of knowledge resource is most needed in AI today? How can modern technology shape its development and evaluation? A recent AAAI workshop gathered over 50 researchers to explore these questions. This paper synthesizes our findings and outlines a community-driven vision for a new knowledge infrastructure. In addition to leveraging contemporary advances in knowledge representation and reasoning, one promising idea is to build an open engineering framework to exploit knowledge modules effectively within the context of practical applications. Such a framework should include sets of conventions and social structures that are adopted by contributors.</p></details> | 17 pages |

The current version of the tool supports the legal TAI assessment, with a particular emphasis on facilitating compliance with the AI Act. It involves a two-step approach with a pre-screening and an assessment phase. The assessment output of the system includes insight regarding the risk-level of the AI system according to the AI Act, while at the same time retrieving relevant articles to aid with compliance and notify on their obligations. Our qualitative evaluation using use-case scenarios yields promising results, correctly predicting risk levels while retrieving relevant articles across three distinct semantic groups. Furthermore, interpretation of results shows that the tool's reasoning relies on comparison with the setting of high-risk systems, a behaviour attributed to their deployment requiring careful consideration, and therefore frequently presented within the AI Act.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 1 figure, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Each to Their Own: Exploring the Optimal Embedding in RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17442v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, as Large Language Models (LLMs) have fundamentally impacted various fields, the methods for incorporating up-to-date information into LLMs or adding external knowledge to construct domain-specific models have garnered wide attention. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), serving as an inference-time scaling method, is notable for its low cost and minimal effort for parameter tuning. However, due to heterogeneous training data and model architecture, the variant embedding models used in RAG exhibit different benefits across various areas, often leading to different similarity calculation results and, consequently, varying response quality from LLMs. To address this problem, we propose and examine two approaches to enhance RAG by combining the benefits of multiple embedding models, named Mixture-Embedding RAG and Confident RAG. Mixture-Embedding RAG simply sorts and selects retrievals from multiple embedding models based on standardized similarity; however, it does not outperform vanilla RAG. In contrast, Confident RAG generates responses multiple times using different embedding models and then selects the responses with the highest confidence level, demonstrating average improvements of approximately 10% and 5% over vanilla LLMs and RAG, respectively. The consistent results across different LLMs and embedding models indicate that Confident RAG is an efficient plug-and-play approach for various domains. We will release our code upon publication.</p></details> |  |

Cloud-based traffic simulation solutions have flourished, offering increasingly realistic representations of the evolving mobility landscape. LLMs have emerged as pioneering tools, providing robust support for various applications, including intelligent decision-making, user interaction, and real-time traffic analysis. As user demand for e-mobility continues to grow, delivering comprehensive end-to-end solutions has become crucial. In this paper, we present a cloud-based, LLM-powered shared e-mobility platform, integrated with a mobile application for personalized route recommendations. The optimization module is evaluated based on travel time and cost across different traffic scenarios. Additionally, the LLM-powered RAG framework is evaluated at the schema level for different users, using various evaluation methods. Schema-level RAG with XiYanSQL achieves an average execution accuracy of 0.81 on system operator queries and 0.98 on user queries.</p></details> |  |

However, discrepancies between these textbooks and the parametric knowledge inherent in Large Language Models (LLMs) can undermine the effectiveness of RAG systems. To systematically investigate RAG system robustness against such knowledge discrepancies, we introduce KnowShiftQA. This novel question answering dataset simulates these discrepancies by applying deliberate hypothetical knowledge updates to both answers and source documents, reflecting how textbook knowledge can shift. KnowShiftQA comprises 3,005 questions across five subjects, designed with a comprehensive question typology focusing on context utilization and knowledge integration. Our extensive experiments on retrieval and question answering performance reveal that most RAG systems suffer a substantial performance drop when faced with these knowledge discrepancies. Furthermore, questions requiring the integration of contextual (textbook) knowledge with parametric (LLM) knowledge pose a significant challenge to current LLMs.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Main |

Yet, a pressing challenge remains: How can we trust these agents especially in zero-shot settings with no fine-tuning? We introduce a novel modular Agentic AI visual classification framework that integrates generalist multimodal agents with a non-visual reasoning orchestrator and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module. Applied to apple leaf disease diagnosis, we benchmark three configurations: (I) zero-shot with confidence-based orchestration, (II) fine-tuned agents with improved performance, and (III) trust-calibrated orchestration enhanced by CLIP-based image retrieval and re-evaluation loops. Using confidence calibration metrics (ECE, OCR, CCC), the orchestrator modulates trust across agents. Our results demonstrate a 77.94\% accuracy improvement in the zero-shot setting using trust-aware orchestration and RAG, achieving 85.63\% overall. GPT-4o showed better calibration, while Qwen-2.5-VL displayed overconfidence. Furthermore, image-RAG grounded predictions with visually similar cases, enabling correction of agent overconfidence via iterative re-evaluation. The proposed system separates perception (vision agents) from meta-reasoning (orchestrator), enabling scalable and interpretable multi-agent AI. This blueprint is extensible to diagnostics, biology, and other trust-critical domains. All models, prompts, results, and system components including the complete software source code are openly released to support reproducibility, transparency, and community benchmarking at Github: https://github.com/Applied-AI-Research-Lab/Orchestrator-Agent-Trust</p></details> |  |
| **[RAG-based Architectures for Drug Side Effect Retrieval in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13822v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drug side effects are a major global health concern, necessitating advanced methods for their accurate detection and analysis. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising conversational interfaces, their inherent limitations, including reliance on black-box training data, susceptibility to hallucinations, and lack of domain-specific knowledge, hinder their reliability in specialized fields like pharmacovigilance. To address this gap, we propose two architectures: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG, which integrate comprehensive drug side effect knowledge into a Llama 3 8B language model. Through extensive evaluations on 19,520 drug side effect associations (covering 976 drugs and 3,851 side effect terms), our results demonstrate that GraphRAG achieves near-perfect accuracy in drug side effect retrieval. This framework offers a highly accurate and scalable solution, signifying a significant advancement in leveraging LLMs for critical pharmacovigilance applications.</p></details> |  |

However, current automated RAG metrics perform poorly in clinical and conversational use cases. Using clinical human evaluations of responses is expensive, unscalable, and not conducive to the continuous iterative development of RAG systems. To address these challenges, we introduce ASTRID - an Automated and Scalable TRIaD for evaluating clinical QA systems leveraging RAG - consisting of three metrics: Context Relevance (CR), Refusal Accuracy (RA), and Conversational Faithfulness (CF). Our novel evaluation metric, CF, is designed to better capture the faithfulness of a model's response to the knowledge base without penalising conversational elements. To validate our triad, we curate a dataset of over 200 real-world patient questions posed to an LLM-based QA agent during surgical follow-up for cataract surgery - the highest volume operation in the world - augmented with clinician-selected questions for emergency, clinical, and non-clinical out-of-domain scenarios. We demonstrate that CF can predict human ratings of faithfulness better than existing definitions for conversational use cases. Furthermore, we show that evaluation using our triad consisting of CF, RA, and CR exhibits alignment with clinician assessment for inappropriate, harmful, or unhelpful responses. Finally, using nine different LLMs, we demonstrate that the three metrics can closely agree with human evaluations, highlighting the potential of these metrics for use in LLM-driven automated evaluation pipelines. We also publish the prompts and datasets for these experiments, providing valuable resources for further research and development.</p></details> | 29 pages |
| **[Secure Multifaceted-RAG for Enterprise: Hybrid Knowledge Retrieval with Security Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13425v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems face challenges in enterprise settings due to limited retrieval scope and data security risks. When relevant internal documents are unavailable, the system struggles to generate accurate and complete responses. Additionally, using closed-source Large Language Models (LLMs) raises concerns about exposing proprietary information. To address these issues, we propose the Secure Multifaceted-RAG (SecMulti-RAG) framework, which retrieves not only from internal documents but also from two supplementary sources: pre-generated expert knowledge for anticipated queries and on-demand external LLM-generated knowledge. To mitigate security risks, we adopt a local open-source generator and selectively utilize external LLMs only when prompts are deemed safe by a filtering mechanism. This approach enhances completeness, prevents data leakage, and reduces costs. In our evaluation on a report generation task in the automotive industry, SecMulti-RAG significantly outperforms traditional RAG - achieving 79.3 to 91.9 percent win rates across correctness, richness, and helpfulness in LLM-based evaluation, and 56.3 to 70.4 percent in human evaluation. This highlights SecMulti-RAG as a practical and secure solution for enterprise RAG.</p></details> |  |

However, when building real-world RAG applications, practical issues arise. First, the retrieved information is generally domain-specific. Since it is computationally expensive to fine-tune LLMs, it is more feasible to fine-tune the retriever to improve the quality of the data included in the LLM input. Second, as more applications are deployed in the same real-world system, one cannot afford to deploy separate retrievers. Moreover, these RAG applications normally retrieve different kinds of data. Our solution is to instruction fine-tune a small retriever encoder on a variety of domain-specific tasks to allow us to deploy one encoder that can serve many use cases, thereby achieving low-cost, scalability, and speed. We show how this encoder generalizes to out-of-domain settings as well as to an unseen retrieval task on real-world enterprise use cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures.

This survey synthesizes both strands under a unified reasoning-retrieval perspective. We first map how advanced reasoning optimizes each stage of RAG (Reasoning-Enhanced RAG). Then, we show how retrieved knowledge of different type supply missing premises and expand context for complex inference (RAG-Enhanced Reasoning). Finally, we spotlight emerging Synergized RAG-Reasoning frameworks, where (agentic) LLMs iteratively interleave search and reasoning to achieve state-of-the-art performance across knowledge-intensive benchmarks.

Improper retrieval settings can degrade performance, making RAG less reliable than closed-book generation. In this work, we introduce RAGGED, a framework for systematically evaluating RAG systems across diverse retriever-reader configurations, retrieval depths, and datasets. Our analysis reveals that reader robustness to noise is the key determinant of RAG stability and scalability. Some readers benefit from increased retrieval depth, while others degrade due to their sensitivity to distracting content. Through large-scale experiments on open-domain, multi-hop, and specialized-domain datasets, we show that retrievers, rerankers, and prompts influence performance but do not fundamentally alter these reader-driven trends. By providing a principled framework and new metrics to assess RAG stability and scalability, RAGGED enables systematic evaluation of retrieval-augmented generation systems, guiding future research on optimizing retrieval depth and model robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/neulab/ragged</p></details> |

Prior work either reduces the response delay (through better scheduling of RAG queries) or strives to maximize quality (which involves tuning the RAG workflow), but they fall short in optimizing the tradeoff between the delay and quality of RAG responses. This paper presents METIS, the first RAG system that jointly schedules queries and adapts the key RAG configurations of each query, such as the number of retrieved text chunks and synthesis methods, in order to balance quality optimization and response delay reduction. Using 4 popular RAG-QA datasets, we show that compared with the state-of-the-art RAG optimization schemes, METIS reduces the generation latency by $1.64-2.54\times$ without sacrificing generation quality.</p></details> | 17 pages, 18 figures |

While large language models (LLMs) offer potential for automating advisory tasks, most existing solutions remain limited to prototypes or synthetic benchmarks. MARAUS addresses this gap by combining hybrid retrieval, multi-agent orchestration, and LLM-based generation into a system tailored for real-world university admissions. In collaboration with the University of Transport Technology (UTT) in Hanoi, we conducted a two-phase study involving technical development and real-world evaluation. MARAUS processed over 6,000 actual user interactions, spanning six categories of queries. Results show substantial improvements over LLM-only baselines: on average 92 percent accuracy, hallucination rates reduced from 15 precent to 1.45 percent, and average response times below 4 seconds. The system operated cost-effectively, with a two-week deployment cost of 11.58 USD using GPT-4o mini. This work provides actionable insights for the deployment of agentic RAG systems in low-resource educational settings.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods have explored enhancing models' search and reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL). Although these methods demonstrate promising results, they face challenges in training stability and encounter issues such as substantial inference time and restricted capabilities due to the single-query mode. In this paper, we propose RAG-R1, a novel training framework designed to enable LLMs to adaptively leverage internal and external knowledge during the reasoning process. We further expand the generation and retrieval processes within the framework from single-query mode to multi-query parallelism, aimed at reducing inference time and enhancing the model's capabilities. Extensive experiments on seven question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the strongest baseline by up to 13.2% and decreases inference time by 11.1%.</p></details> |  |

Although there exist multiple RAG benchmarks for English, evaluation resources for other languages, including Russian, remain scarce and static, failing to capture the dynamic nature of real-world deployments. In this work, we present DRAGON (Dynamic RAG Benchmark On News), the first dynamic benchmark for evaluating RAG systems in Russian on a changing news corpora. DRAGON is built upon a regularly updated corpus of Russian news and public documents and supports comprehensive evaluation of both the retriever and generator components. Question generation is performed automatically with the use of Knowledge Graph constructed from the corpus and enables the extraction of four core question types aligned with distinct subgraph patterns. We release a complete evaluation framework comprising the pipeline for automatic question generation, evaluation scripts, which are potentially reusable for other languages and multilingual settings, and benchmark data. We also launch a public leaderboard to encourage community participation and comparison.</p></details> |  |

What Can Predicted Query Performance Tell Us about the Search Behaviour of Agentic RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10411v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a new paradigm where the reasoning model decides when to invoke a retriever (as a "tool") when answering a question. This paradigm, exemplified by recent research works such as Search-R1, enables the model to decide when to search and obtain external information. However, the queries generated by such Agentic RAG models and the role of the retriever in obtaining high-quality answers remain understudied. To this end, this initial study examines the applicability of query performance prediction (QPP) within the recent Agentic RAG models Search-R1 and R1-Searcher. We find that applying effective retrievers can achieve higher answer quality within a shorter reasoning process. Moreover, the QPP estimates of the generated queries, used as an approximation of their retrieval quality, are positively correlated with the quality of the final answer. Ultimately, our work is a step towards adaptive retrieval within Agentic RAG, where QPP is used to inform the model if the retrieved results are likely to be useful.</p></details> |  |

While classical machine learning models leverage structured socio-demographic and behavioral data, they often fail to capture the nuanced emotional and contextual factors embedded in unstructured student interactions. This paper introduces a transformative AI framework that redefines dropout prediction through three synergistic innovations: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for domain-specific sentiment analysis, prompt engineering to decode academic stressors,and cross-modal attention fusion to dynamically align textual, behavioral, and socio-demographic insights. By grounding sentiment analysis in a curated knowledge base of pedagogical content, our RAG-enhanced BERT model interprets student comments with unprecedented contextual relevance, while optimized prompts isolate indicators of academic distress (e.g., "isolation," "workload anxiety"). A cross-modal attention layer then fuses these insights with temporal engagement patterns, creating holistic risk pro-files. Evaluated on a longitudinal dataset of 4 423 students, the framework achieves 89% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.88, outperforming conventional models by 7% and reducing false negatives by 21%. Beyond prediction, the system generates interpretable interventions by retrieving contextually aligned strategies (e.g., mentorship programs for isolated learners). This work bridges the gap between predictive analytics and actionable pedagogy, offering a scalable solution to mitigate dropout risks in global education systems</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, 1 Algorithms, 17th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies,: 30 June-2 July, 2025 Location: Palma, Spain</p></details> |

We present a novel multimodal document chunking approach that leverages Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to process PDF documents in batches while maintaining semantic coherence and structural integrity. Our method processes documents in configurable page batches with cross-batch context preservation, enabling accurate handling of tables spanning multiple pages, embedded visual elements, and procedural content. We evaluate our approach on a curated dataset of PDF documents with manually crafted queries, demonstrating improvements in chunk quality and downstream RAG performance. Our vision-guided approach achieves better accuracy compared to traditional vanilla RAG systems, with qualitative analysis showing superior preservation of document structure and semantic coherence.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 1 Figure, 1 Table</p></details> |

However, their effectiveness remains constrained when reasoning extends beyond the knowledge acquired during pretraining. Conventional approaches, such as fine-tuning or retrieval-augmented generation, face limitations in either imposing high computational overhead or failing to fully exploit structured scientific data. To overcome these challenges, we propose DrugMCTS, a novel framework that synergistically integrates RAG, multi-agent collaboration, and Monte Carlo Tree Search for drug repurposing. The framework employs five specialized agents tasked with retrieving and analyzing molecular and protein information, thereby enabling structured and iterative reasoning. Without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning, DrugMCTS empowers Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct to outperform Deepseek-R1 by over 20\%. Extensive experiments on the DrugBank and KIBA datasets demonstrate that DrugMCTS achieves substantially higher recall and robustness compared to both general-purpose LLMs and deep learning baselines. Our results highlight the importance of structured reasoning, agent-based collaboration, and feedback-driven search mechanisms in advancing LLM applications for drug discovery.</p></details> |  |

We present HedraRAG, a runtime system built on a graph-based abstraction that exposes optimization opportunities across stage-level parallelism, intra-request similarity, and inter-request skewness. These opportunities are realized through dynamic graph transformations, such as node splitting, reordering, edge addition, and dependency rewiring, applied to wavefronts of subgraphs spanning concurrent requests. The resulting execution plans are mapped onto hybrid CPU-GPU pipelines to improve resource utilization and reduce latency. Evaluations across a wide range of RAG workflows demonstrate speedups exceeding 1.5x and reaching up to 5x over existing frameworks, showcasing the effectiveness of coordinated generation and retrieval in serving environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SOSP 2025</p></details> |

However, its adoption is hindered by the complexity of policy languages and the risk of misconfigurations. In this work, we present ARPaCCino, an agentic system that combines Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG), and tool-based validation to automate the generation and verification of PaC rules. Given natural language descriptions of the desired policies, ARPaCCino generates formal Rego rules, assesses IaC compliance, and iteratively refines the IaC configurations to ensure conformance. Thanks to its modular agentic architecture and integration with external tools and knowledge bases, ARPaCCino supports policy validation across a wide range of technologies, including niche or emerging IaC frameworks. Experimental evaluation involving a Terraform-based case study demonstrates ARPaCCino's effectiveness in generating syntactically and semantically correct policies, identifying non-compliant infrastructures, and applying corrective modifications, even when using smaller, open-weight LLMs. Our results highlight the potential of agentic RAG architectures to enhance the automation, reliability, and accessibility of PaC workflows.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by incorporating external information, often from graph-structured data. However, existing graph-based RAG methods suffer from poor graph quality due to incomplete extraction and insufficient utilization of query information during retrieval. To overcome these limitations, we propose CUE-RAG, a novel approach that introduces (1) a multi-partite graph index incorporates text Chunks, knowledge Units, and Entities to capture semantic content at multiple levels of granularity, (2) a hybrid extraction strategy that reduces LLM token usage while still producing accurate and disambiguated knowledge units, and (3) Q-Iter, a query-driven iterative retrieval strategy that enhances relevance through semantic search and constrained graph traversal. Experiments on three QA benchmarks show that CUE-RAG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 99.33% higher Accuracy and 113.51% higher F1 score while reducing indexing costs by 72.58%. Remarkably, CUE-RAG matches or outperforms baselines even without using an LLM for indexing. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of CUE-RAG in advancing graph-based RAG systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[MIRA: A Novel Framework for Fusing Modalities in Medical RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07902v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced AI-assisted medical diagnosis, but they often generate factually inconsistent responses that deviate from established medical knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances factual accuracy by integrating external sources, but it presents two key challenges. First, insufficient retrieval can miss critical information, whereas excessive retrieval can introduce irrelevant or misleading content, disrupting model output. Second, even when the model initially provides correct answers, over-reliance on retrieved data can lead to factual errors. To address these issues, we introduce the Multimodal Intelligent Retrieval and Augmentation (MIRA) framework, designed to optimize factual accuracy in MLLM. MIRA consists of two key components: (1) a calibrated Rethinking and Rearrangement module that dynamically adjusts the number of retrieved contexts to manage factual risk, and (2) A medical RAG framework integrating image embeddings and a medical knowledge base with a query-rewrite module for efficient multimodal reasoning. This enables the model to effectively integrate both its inherent knowledge and external references. Our evaluation of publicly available medical VQA and report generation benchmarks demonstrates that MIRA substantially enhances factual accuracy and overall performance, achieving new state-of-the-art results.

| **[KeyKnowledgeRAG (K^2RAG): An Enhanced RAG method for improved LLM question-answering capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07695v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning is an immensely resource-intensive process when retraining Large Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate a larger body of knowledge. Although many fine-tuning techniques have been developed to reduce the time and computational cost involved, the challenge persists as LLMs continue to grow in size and complexity. To address this, a new approach to knowledge expansion in LLMs is needed. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers one such alternative by storing external knowledge in a database and retrieving relevant chunks to support question answering. However, naive implementations of RAG face significant limitations in scalability and answer accuracy. This paper introduces KeyKnowledgeRAG (K2RAG), a novel framework designed to overcome these limitations. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer paradigm, K2RAG integrates dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text summarization to improve retrieval quality and system efficiency. The framework also includes a preprocessing step that summarizes the training data, significantly reducing the training time. K2RAG was evaluated using the MultiHopRAG dataset, where the proposed pipeline was trained on the document corpus and tested on a separate evaluation set. Results demonstrated notable improvements over common naive RAG implementations. K2RAG achieved the highest mean answer similarity score of 0.57, and reached the highest third quartile (Q3) similarity of 0.82, indicating better alignment with ground-truth answers. In addition to improved accuracy, the framework proved highly efficient. The summarization step reduced the average training time of individual components by 93%, and execution speed was up to 40% faster than traditional knowledge graph-based RAG systems. K2RAG also demonstrated superior scalability, requiring three times less VRAM than several naive RAG implementations tested in this study.</p></details> | 21 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Multi-Head RAG: Solving Multi-Aspect Problems with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05085v4)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling the retrieval of documents into the LLM context to provide more accurate and relevant responses. Existing RAG solutions do not focus on queries that may require fetching multiple documents with substantially different contents. Such queries occur frequently, but are challenging because the embeddings of these documents may be distant in the embedding space, making it hard to retrieve them all. This paper introduces Multi-Head RAG (MRAG), a novel scheme designed to address this gap with a simple yet powerful idea: leveraging activations of Transformer's multi-head attention layer, instead of the decoder layer, as keys for fetching multi-aspect documents. The driving observation is that different attention heads learn to capture different data aspects. Harnessing the corresponding activations results in embeddings that represent various facets of data items and queries, improving the retrieval accuracy for complex queries. We provide an evaluation methodology and metrics, multi-aspect datasets, and real-world use cases to demonstrate MRAG's effectiveness. We show MRAG's design advantages over 18 RAG baselines, empirical improvements of up to 20% in retrieval success ratios, and benefits for downstream LLM generation. MRAG can be seamlessly integrated with existing RAG frameworks and benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Cross-Lingual Cost: Retrieval Biases in RAG over Arabic-English Corpora](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07543v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-lingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a critical capability for retrieving and generating answers across languages. Prior work in this context has mostly focused on generation and relied on benchmarks derived from open-domain sources, most notably Wikipedia. In such settings, retrieval challenges often remain hidden due to language imbalances, overlap with pretraining data, and memorized content. To address this gap, we study Arabic-English RAG in a domain-specific setting using benchmarks derived from real-world corporate datasets. Our benchmarks include all combinations of languages for the user query and the supporting document, drawn independently and uniformly at random. This enables a systematic study of multilingual retrieval behavior. Our findings reveal that retrieval is a critical bottleneck in cross-lingual domain-specific scenarios, with significant performance drops occurring when the user query and supporting document languages differ. A key insight is that these failures stem primarily from the retriever's difficulty in ranking documents across languages. Finally, we propose a simple retrieval strategy that addresses this source of failure by enforcing equal retrieval from both languages, resulting in substantial improvements in cross-lingual and overall performance. These results highlight meaningful opportunities for improving multilingual retrieval, particularly in practical, real-world RAG applications.</p></details> |  |

Benefiting from the strong ability in facilitating diverse data sources and supporting faithful reasoning, knowledge graphs (KGs) have been increasingly adopted in RAG systems, giving rise to KG-based RAG (KG-RAG) methods. Though RAG systems are widely applied in various applications, recent studies have also revealed its vulnerabilities to data poisoning attacks, where malicious information injected into external knowledge sources can mislead the system into producing incorrect or harmful responses. However, these studies focus exclusively on RAG systems using unstructured textual data sources, leaving the security risks of KG-RAG largely unexplored, despite the fact that KGs present unique vulnerabilities due to their structured and editable nature. In this work, we conduct the first systematic investigation of the security issue of KG-RAG methods through data poisoning attacks. To this end, we introduce a practical, stealthy attack setting that aligns with real-world implementation. We propose an attack strategy that first identifies adversarial target answers and then inserts perturbation triples to complete misleading inference chains in the KG, increasing the likelihood that KG-RAG methods retrieve and rely on these perturbations during generation. Through extensive experiments on two benchmarks and four recent KG-RAG methods, our attack strategy demonstrates strong effectiveness in degrading KG-RAG performance, even with minimal KG perturbations. In-depth analyses are also conducted to understand the safety threats within the internal stages of KG-RAG systems and to explore the robustness of LLMs against adversarial knowledge.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

Retrievers encompass a multitude of hyperparameters that significantly impact performance outcomes and demonstrate sensitivity to specific applications. Nevertheless, hyperparameter optimization entails prohibitively high computational expenses. Existing evaluation methods suffer from either prohibitive costs or disconnection from domain-specific scenarios. This paper proposes SEARA (Subset sampling Evaluation for Automatic Retriever Assessment), which addresses evaluation data challenges through subset sampling techniques and achieves robust automated retriever evaluation by minimal retrieval facts extraction and comprehensive retrieval metrics. Based on real user queries, this method enables fully automated retriever evaluation at low cost, thereby obtaining optimal retriever for specific business scenarios. We validate our method across classic RAG applications in rednote, including knowledge-based Q&A system and retrieval-based travel assistant, successfully obtaining scenario-specific optimal retrievers.</p></details> |  |

Currently, text visualizations are confined either to _flat, line-based_ decorations, which can convey only limited information about textual structure, or _nested boxes_, which convey structure but often destroy the typographic layout of the underlying text. We hypothesize that the lack of rich styling options limits the kinds of information that are displayed alongside text, wherever it may be displayed. In this paper, we show that it is possible to achieve arbitrarily nested decorations while minimally disturbing the underlying typographic layout. Specifically, we present a layout algorithm that generates _ragged blocks_, or _rocks_, which are rectilinear polygons that allow nested text to be compactly rendered even when styled with borders and padding. We evaluate our layout algorithm in two ways. First, on a benchmark suite comprising representative source code files in multiple programming languages, we show that the (ragged block) layouts produced by our algorithm are substantially more compact than the (rectangular block) layouts produced by conventional techniques, when uniformly styling every element in the syntax tree with borders and padding. Second, through a small gallery of usage scenarios, we demonstrate how future code editors, word processors, and other document-rendering GUIs might convey rich semantic information through domain-specific styling of ragged blocks.</p></details> |  |

This work addresses the Closed Visual Question Answering (CVQA) task, where the goal is to select the correct answer to multiple-choice clinical questions based on both user-submitted images and accompanying symptom descriptions. The proposed approach combines three core components: (1) fine-tuning open-source multimodal models from the Qwen, Gemma, and LLaMA families on the competition dataset, (2) introducing a structured reasoning layer that reconciles and adjudicates between candidate model outputs, and (3) incorporating agentic retrieval-augmented generation (agentic RAG), which adds relevant information from the American Academy of Dermatology's symptom and condition database to fill in gaps in patient context. The team achieved second place with a submission that scored sixth, demonstrating competitive performance and high accuracy. Beyond competitive benchmarks, this research addresses a practical challenge in telemedicine: diagnostic decisions must often be made asynchronously, with limited input and with high accuracy and interpretability. By emulating the systematic reasoning patterns employed by dermatologists when evaluating skin conditions, this architecture provided a pathway toward more reliable automated diagnostic support systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 ImageCLEF MEDIQA-MAGIC Challenge</p></details> |

However, RAG's reliance on ingesting external documents introduces new vulnerabilities. This paper exposes a critical security gap at the data loading stage, where malicious actors can stealthily corrupt RAG pipelines by exploiting document ingestion. We propose a taxonomy of 9 knowledge-based poisoning attacks and introduce two novel threat vectors -- Content Obfuscation and Content Injection -- targeting common formats (DOCX, HTML, PDF). Using an automated toolkit implementing 19 stealthy injection techniques, we test five popular data loaders, finding a 74.4% attack success rate across 357 scenarios. We further validate these threats on six end-to-end RAG systems -- including white-box pipelines and black-box services like NotebookLM and OpenAI Assistants -- demonstrating high success rates and critical vulnerabilities that bypass filters and silently compromise output integrity. Our results emphasize the urgent need to secure the document ingestion process in RAG systems against covert content manipulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>curre...</summary><p>currently under submission</p></details> |

In this paper, we explore and assess the feasibility of using traditional binary string features for MFC in the new era of large language models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Specifically, we investigate how Family-Specific String (FSS) features could be utilized in a manner similar to RAG to facilitate MFC. To this end, we develop a curated evaluation framework covering 4,347 samples from 67 malware families, extract and analyze over 25 million strings, and conduct detailed ablation studies to assess the impact of different design choices in four major modules.</p></details> |  |

However, existing retrieval systems predominantly focus on natural text-image matching and lack the capacity to address the diversity and ambiguity inherent in real-world educational scenarios. To address this limitation, we develop a lightweight and efficient multi-modal retrieval module, named Uni-Retrieval, which extracts query-style prototypes and dynamically matches them with tokens from a continually updated Prompt Bank. This Prompt Bank encodes and stores domain-specific knowledge by leveraging a Mixture-of-Expert Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE-LoRA) module and can be adapted to enhance Uni-Retrieval's capability to accommodate unseen query types at test time. To enable natural language educational content generation, we integrate the original Uni-Retrieval with a compact instruction-tuned language model, forming a complete retrieval-augmented generation pipeline named Uni-RAG. Given a style-conditioned query, Uni-RAG first retrieves relevant educational materials and then generates human-readable explanations, feedback, or instructional content aligned with the learning objective. Experimental results on SER and other multi-modal benchmarks show that Uni-RAG outperforms baseline retrieval and RAG systems in both retrieval accuracy and generation quality, while maintaining low computational cost. Our framework provides a scalable, pedagogically grounded solution for intelligent educational systems, bridging retrieval and generation to support personalized, explainable, and efficient learning assistance across diverse STEM scenarios.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we conduct the first systematic evaluation of RAG systems that integrate fairness-aware rankings, addressing both ranking fairness and attribution fairness, which ensures equitable exposure of the sources cited in the generated content. Our evaluation focuses on measuring item-side fairness, specifically the fair exposure of relevant items retrieved by RAG systems, and investigates how this fairness impacts both the effectiveness of the systems and the attribution of sources in the generated output that users ultimately see. By experimenting with twelve RAG models across seven distinct tasks, we show that incorporating fairness-aware retrieval often maintains or even enhances both ranking quality and generation quality, countering the common belief that fairness compromises system performance. Additionally, we demonstrate that fair retrieval practices lead to more balanced attribution in the final responses, ensuring that the generator fairly cites the sources it relies on. Our findings underscore the importance of item-side fairness in retrieval and generation, laying the foundation for responsible and equitable RAG systems and guiding future research in fair ranking and attribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICTIR...</summary><p>ICTIR 2025 (Oral); NeurIPS 2024 AFME Workshop (Spotlight)</p></details> |

Within the ORAN architecture, Large Language Models (LLMs) can be specialized to generate xApps and rApps by leveraging specifications and API definitions from the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) platform. However, fine-tuning base LLMs for telecom-specific tasks remains expensive and resource-intensive. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a practical alternative through in-context learning, enabling domain adaptation without full retraining. While traditional RAG systems rely on vector-based retrieval, emerging variants such as GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG incorporate knowledge graphs or dual retrieval strategies to support multi-hop reasoning and improve factual grounding. Despite their promise, these methods lack systematic, metric-driven evaluations, particularly in high-stakes domains such as ORAN. In this study, we conduct a comparative evaluation of Vector RAG, GraphRAG, and Hybrid GraphRAG using ORAN specifications. We assess performance across varying question complexities using established generation metrics: faithfulness, answer relevance, context relevance, and factual correctness. Results show that both GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG outperform traditional RAG. Hybrid GraphRAG improves factual correctness by 8%, while GraphRAG improves context relevance by 7%.</p></details> |  |

National protocols and WHO recommendations are typically extensive and complex, making it difficult to extract precise information, especially during urgent situations. This project tackles that issue by developing a multilingual, intelligent question-answering system that transforms static vaccination guidelines into an interactive and user-friendly knowledge base. Built on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework and enhanced with agent-based reasoning (Agentic RAG), the system provides accurate, context-sensitive answers to complex medical queries.

While GraphRAG has shown promise for multi-hop reasoning and structured retrieval, its adoption has been limited by the high computational cost of constructing knowledge graphs using large language models (LLMs) and the latency of graph-based retrieval. To address these challenges, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a dependency-based knowledge graph construction pipeline that leverages industrial-grade NLP libraries to extract entities and relations from unstructured text completely eliminating reliance on LLMs; and (2) a lightweight graph retrieval strategy that combines hybrid query node identification with efficient one-hop traversal for high-recall, low-latency subgraph extraction. We evaluate our framework on two SAP datasets focused on legacy code migration and demonstrate strong empirical performance. Our system achieves up to 15% and 4.35% improvements over traditional RAG baselines based on LLM-as-Judge and RAGAS metrics, respectively. Moreover, our dependency-based construction approach attains 94% of the performance of LLM-generated knowledge graphs (61.87% vs. 65.83%) while significantly reducing cost and improving scalability. These results validate the feasibility of deploying GraphRAG systems in real-world, large-scale enterprise applications without incurring prohibitive resource requirements paving the way for practical, explainable, and domain-adaptable retrieval-augmented reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[CyberRAG: An agentic RAG cyber attack classification and reporting tool](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02424v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) in large enterprises can generate hundreds of thousands of alerts per hour, overwhelming security analysts with logs that demand deep, rapidly evolving domain expertise. Conventional machine-learning detectors trim the alert volume but still yield high false-positive rates, while standard single-pass Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines often retrieve irrelevant context and fail to justify their predictions. To overcome these shortcomings, we present CyberRAG, a modular, agent-based RAG framework that delivers real-time classification, explanation, and structured reporting for cyber-attacks. A central LLM agent orchestrates (i) a pool of fine-tuned specialized classifiers, each tailored to a distinct attack family; (ii) tool adapters for enrichment and alerting; and (iii) an iterative retrieval-and-reason loop that continuously queries a domain-specific knowledge base until the evidence is both relevant and self-consistent. Unlike traditional RAG systems, CyberRAG embraces an agentic design that enables dynamic control flow and adaptive reasoning. This agent-centric architecture refines its threat labels and natural-language justifications autonomously, reducing false positives and enhancing interpretability. The framework is fully extensible: new attack types can be supported by simply adding a classifier without retraining the core agent. CyberRAG has been evaluated achieving over 94% accuracy per class and pushing final classification accuracy to 94.92% through semantic orchestration. Generated explanations score up to 0.94 in BERTScore and 4.9/5 in GPT-4-based expert evaluation. These results show that agentic, specialist-oriented RAG can pair high detection accuracy with trustworthy, SOC-ready prose, offering a practical and scalable path toward semi-autonomous cyber-defence workflows.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a generative AI-powered GATE question-answering framework (GATE stands for Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering) that leverages LLMs to explain GATE solutions and support students in their exam preparation. We conducted extensive benchmarking to select the optimal embedding model and LLM, evaluating our framework based on criteria such as latency, faithfulness, and relevance, with additional validation through human evaluation. Our chatbot integrates state-of-the-art embedding models and LLMs to deliver accurate, context-aware responses. Through rigorous experimentation, we identified configurations that balance performance and computational efficiency, ensuring a reliable chatbot to serve students' needs. Additionally, we discuss the challenges faced in data processing and modeling and implemented solutions. Our work explores the application of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for GATE Q/A explanation tasks, and our findings demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and response quality. This research offers practical insights for developing effective AI-driven educational tools while highlighting areas for future enhancement in usability and scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>One o...</summary><p>One of the co-authors is having conflict in the submission to arXiv due to many edits (we have to make changes in evaluation strategies, i.e. section 5); in the paper there are still formatting issues</p></details> |

Existing vector search and RAG solutions largely assume abundant computation resources, making them impractical for on-device scenarios. In this paper, we propose MobileRAG, a fully on-device pipeline that overcomes these limitations by combining a mobile-friendly vector search algorithm, \textit{EcoVector}, with a lightweight \textit{Selective Content Reduction} (SCR) method. By partitioning and partially loading index data, EcoVector drastically reduces both memory footprint and CPU usage, while the SCR method filters out irrelevant text to diminish Language Model (LM) input size without degrading accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrated that MobileRAG significantly outperforms conventional vector search and RAG methods in terms of latency, memory usage, and power consumption, while maintaining accuracy and enabling offline operation to safeguard privacy in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | 14 pages |

However, complex tasks requiring multi-round retrieval remain challenging, and early attempts tend to be overly optimistic without a good sense of self-skepticism. Current multi-round RAG systems may continue searching even when enough information has already been retrieved, or they may provide incorrect answers without having sufficient information or knowledge. Existing solutions either require large amounts of expensive human-labeled process supervision data or lead to subpar performance. This paper aims to address these limitations by introducing a new framework, SIM-RAG, to explicitly enhance RAG systems' self-awareness and multi-round retrieval capabilities. To train SIM-RAG, we first let a RAG system self-practice multi-round retrieval, augmenting existing question-answer pairs with intermediate inner monologue reasoning steps to generate synthetic training data. For each pair, the system may explore multiple retrieval paths, which are labeled as successful if they reach the correct answer and unsuccessful otherwise. Using this data, we train a lightweight information sufficiency Critic. At inference time, the Critic evaluates whether the RAG system has retrieved sufficient information at each round, guiding retrieval decisions and improving system-level self-awareness through in-context reinforcement learning. Experiments across multiple prominent RAG benchmarks show that SIM-RAG is an effective multi-round RAG solution. Furthermore, this framework is system-efficient, adding a lightweight component to RAG without requiring modifications to existing LLMs or search engines, and data-efficient, eliminating the need for costly human-annotated mid-step retrieval process supervision data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 48th International ACM SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

While traditional flight control relies on hardcoded equations, recent Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential for more flexible problem-solving but struggle with reliably selecting and applying correct mathematical formulations and executing precise multi-step arithmetic. We propose RAG-UAV, a retrieval-augmented generation framework designed to improve the mathematical reasoning of several LLMs (including GPT o1/Turbo, Llama-3.2/3.3, Mistral, and DeepSeek R1) in UAV-specific contexts by providing access to relevant domain literature. To conduct an initial assessment, we introduce the UAV-Math-Bench, a 20-question problem set of UAV-centric mathematical problems across four difficulty levels. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating retrieval substantially increases exact answer accuracy (achieving up to 75% with o1), reduces instances of incorrect formulation selection (from 25% without RAG to 5\% with RAG), and decreases numerical errors, reducing Mean Squared Error (MSE) by orders of magnitude for the best-performing models. This pilot study indicates that RAG can enable general-purpose LLMs to function as more reliable tools for engineering analysis, although direct real-time flight control requires further investigation and validation on a larger scale. All benchmark data, questions, and answers are publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures, 4 appendix subsections</p></details> |

The context for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems in most benchmarks comes from Wikipedia-like texts written in a neutral and factual tone. However, real-world RAG applications often retrieve internet-based text with diverse tones and linguistic styles, posing challenges for downstream tasks. This paper introduces (a) a dataset that transforms RAG-retrieved passages into emotionally inflected and sarcastic text, (b) an emotion translation model for adapting text to different tones, and (c) a prompt-based method to improve LLMs' pragmatic interpretation of retrieved text.</p></details> |  |

To mitigate these, recent methodologies have integrated information retrieved from external resources with LLMs, substantially enhancing their performance across NLP tasks. This survey paper addresses the absence of a comprehensive overview on Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RALMs), both Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Retrieval-Augmented Understanding (RAU), providing an in-depth examination of their paradigm, evolution, taxonomy, and applications. The paper discusses the essential components of RALMs, including Retrievers, Language Models, and Augmentations, and how their interactions lead to diverse model structures and applications. RALMs demonstrate utility in a spectrum of tasks, from translation and dialogue systems to knowledge-intensive applications. The survey includes several evaluation methods of RALMs, emphasizing the importance of robustness, accuracy, and relevance in their assessment. It also acknowledges the limitations of RALMs, particularly in retrieval quality and computational efficiency, offering directions for future research. In conclusion, this survey aims to offer a structured insight into RALMs, their potential, and the avenues for their future development in NLP.

The system is built on a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework, which integrates a curated knowledge base to ensure factual consistency. To enhance retrieval effectiveness across diverse question types, we implement a hybrid search strategy that combines dense vector similarity with sparse keyword-based retrieval. This dual-retrieval mechanism improves robustness for both general and domain-specific queries. The system includes a feedback loop in which students can rate responses and instructors can review and revise them. Instructor corrections are incorporated into the retrieval corpus, enabling adaptive refinement over time. The system was deployed in a classroom setting as a substitute for traditional office hours, where it successfully addressed a broad range of student queries. It was also used to provide technical support by integrating with a customer-specific knowledge base, demonstrating its ability to handle routine, context-sensitive tasks in applied domains.

However, LLMs often fail to faithfully integrate retrieved evidence into their generated responses, leading to factual inconsistencies. To quantify this gap, we introduce Entity-Context Divergence (ECD), a metric that measures the extent to which retrieved information is accurately reflected in model outputs. We systematically evaluate contemporary LLMs on their ability to preserve factual consistency in retrieval-augmented settings, a capability we define as RAG-ability. Our empirical analysis reveals that RAG-ability remains low across most LLMs, highlighting significant challenges in entity retention and context fidelity. This paper introduces Radiant (Retrieval AugmenteD entIty-context AligNmenT), a novel framework that merges RAG with alignment designed to optimize the interplay between retrieved evidence and generated content. Radiant extends Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to teach LLMs how to integrate provided additional information into subsequent generations. As a behavior correction mechanism, Radiant boosts RAG performance across varied retrieval scenarios, such as noisy web contexts, knowledge conflicts, and hallucination reduction. This enables more reliable, contextually grounded, and factually coherent content generation.</p></details> |  |

This research presents a complex framework that leverages Data Science methodologies, notably Large Language Models (LLM) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, to improve the efficiency of analyzing Calcutta High Court verdicts. Our framework focuses on two key aspects: first, the creation of a robust summarization mechanism that distills complex legal texts into concise and coherent summaries; and second, the development of an intelligent system for retrieving similar cases, which will assist legal professionals in research and decision making. By fine-tuning the Pegasus model using case head note summaries, we achieve significant improvements in the summarization of legal cases. Our two-step summarizing technique preserves crucial legal contexts, allowing for the production of a comprehensive vector database for RAG. The RAG-powered framework efficiently retrieves similar cases in response to user queries, offering thorough overviews and summaries. This technique not only improves legal research efficiency, but it also helps legal professionals and students easily acquire and grasp key legal information, benefiting the overall legal scenario.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Knowledge Augmented Finetuning Matters in both RAG and Agent Based Dialog Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22852v1)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to dialog systems. Despite making progress, LLMs are prone to errors in knowledge-intensive scenarios. Recently, approaches based on retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and agent have emerged to improve the factual accuracy by enhancing the LLMs with knowledge retrieved from external knowledge bases (KBs). This is mostly implemented by prompting the LLMs with instructions, examples and the retrieved knowledge. However, LLMs may have difficulty using the retrieved knowledge effectively for response generation, because they are not well trained to do such generation for specific domains. To mitigate this problem, we propose to finetune the LLMs in the RAG-based and agent-based systems with domain-specific data, together with domain-specific external knowledge, which is called knowledge augmented finetuning (KAFT). We base our study on the MobileCS2 dataset, a real-life customer service dialog dataset that features intensive knowledge interactions, to systematically compare the prompting and KAFT techniques in the RAG-based and agent-based systems. Experiment results show that KAFT substantially surpasses prompting in both RAG and agent systems, particularly in terms of factual accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this paper represents the first solid empirical work to investigate the KAFT idea.</p></details> |  |

However, there is a lack of empirical studies that report on the development of RAG-based implementations grounded in real-world use cases, evaluated through general user involvement, and accompanied by systematic documentation of lessons learned. This paper presents five domain-specific RAG applications developed for real-world scenarios across governance, cybersecurity, agriculture, industrial research, and medical diagnostics. Each system incorporates multilingual OCR, semantic retrieval via vector embeddings, and domain-adapted LLMs, deployed through local servers or cloud APIs to meet distinct user needs. A web-based evaluation involving a total of 100 participants assessed the systems across six dimensions: (i) Ease of Use, (ii) Relevance, (iii) Transparency, (iv) Responsiveness, (v) Accuracy, and (vi) Likelihood of Recommendation.

Answering questions over such content often requires joint reasoning across modalities, which strains traditional large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines due to token limitations, layout loss, and fragmented cross-modal context. We introduce MultiFinRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework purpose-built for financial QA. MultiFinRAG first performs multimodal extraction by grouping table and figure images into batches and sending them to a lightweight, quantized open-source multimodal LLM, which produces both structured JSON outputs and concise textual summaries. These outputs, along with narrative text, are embedded and indexed with modality-aware similarity thresholds for precise retrieval. A tiered fallback strategy then dynamically escalates from text-only to text+table+image contexts when necessary, enabling cross-modal reasoning while reducing irrelevant context. Despite running on commodity hardware, MultiFinRAG achieves 19 percentage points higher accuracy than ChatGPT-4o (free-tier) on complex financial QA tasks involving text, tables, images, and combined multimodal reasoning.</p></details> | Preprint Copy |
| **[CCRS: A Zero-Shot LLM-as-a-Judge Framework for Comprehensive RAG Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20128v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RAG systems enhance LLMs by incorporating external knowledge, which is crucial for domains that demand factual accuracy and up-to-date information. However, evaluating the multifaceted quality of RAG outputs, spanning aspects such as contextual coherence, query relevance, factual correctness, and informational completeness, poses significant challenges. Existing evaluation methods often rely on simple lexical overlap metrics, which are inadequate for capturing these nuances, or involve complex multi-stage pipelines with intermediate steps like claim extraction or require finetuning specialized judge models, hindering practical efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose CCRS (Contextual Coherence and Relevance Score), a novel suite of five metrics that utilizes a single, powerful, pretrained LLM as a zero-shot, end-to-end judge. CCRS evaluates: Contextual Coherence (CC), Question Relevance (QR), Information Density (ID), Answer Correctness (AC), and Information Recall (IR). We apply CCRS to evaluate six diverse RAG system configurations on the challenging BioASQ dataset. Our analysis demonstrates that CCRS effectively discriminates between system performances, confirming, for instance, that the Mistral-7B reader outperforms Llama variants. We provide a detailed analysis of CCRS metric properties, including score distributions, convergent/discriminant validity, tie rates, population statistics, and discriminative power. Compared to the complex RAGChecker framework, CCRS offers comparable or superior discriminative power for key aspects like recall and faithfulness, while being significantly more computationally efficient. CCRS thus provides a practical, comprehensive, and efficient framework for evaluating and iteratively improving RAG systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at LLM4Eval @ SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

While the effectiveness of the retrieval module is typically evaluated with relevance-based ranking metrics, such metrics may be insufficient to reflect the retrieval's impact on the final RAG result, especially in long-form generation scenarios. We argue that providing a comprehensive retrieval-augmented context is important for long-form RAG tasks like report generation and propose metrics for assessing the context independent of generation. We introduce CRUX, a \textbf{C}ontrolled \textbf{R}etrieval-a\textbf{U}gmented conte\textbf{X}t evaluation framework designed to directly assess retrieval-augmented contexts. This framework uses human-written summaries to control the information scope of knowledge, enabling us to measure how well the context covers information essential for long-form generation. CRUX uses question-based evaluation to assess RAG's retrieval in a fine-grained manner. Empirical results show that CRUX offers more reflective and diagnostic evaluation. Our findings also reveal substantial room for improvement in current retrieval methods, pointing to promising directions for advancing RAG's retrieval. Our data and code are publicly available to support and advance future research on retrieval.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, we propose Temporal Causal Probabilistic Description Logic (T-CPDL), an integrated framework that extends traditional Description Logic with temporal interval operators, explicit causal relationships, and probabilistic annotations. We present two distinct variants of T-CPDL: one capturing qualitative temporal relationships through Allen's interval algebra, and another variant enriched with explicit timestamped causal assertions. Both variants share a unified logical structure, enabling complex reasoning tasks ranging from simple temporal ordering to nuanced probabilistic causation. Empirical evaluations on temporal reasoning and causal inference benchmarks confirm that T-CPDL substantially improves inference accuracy, interpretability, and confidence calibration of language model outputs. By delivering transparent reasoning paths and fine-grained temporal and causal semantics, T-CPDL significantly enhances the capability of language models to support robust, explainable, and trustworthy decision-making. This work also lays the groundwork for developing advanced Logic-Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Logic-RAG) frameworks, potentially boosting the reasoning capabilities and efficiency of knowledge graph-enhanced RAG systems.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we introduce a modular AI system that leverages a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to automate standard applicability determination. Given a free-text device description, our system retrieves candidate standards from a curated corpus and uses large language models to infer jurisdiction-specific applicability, classified as Mandatory, Recommended, or Not Applicable, with traceable justifications. We construct an international benchmark dataset of medical device descriptions with expert-annotated standard mappings, and evaluate our system against retrieval-only, zero-shot, and rule-based baselines. The proposed approach attains a classification accuracy of 73% and a Top-5 retrieval recall of 87%, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying relevant regulatory standards. We introduce the first end-to-end system for standard applicability reasoning, enabling scalable and interpretable AI-supported regulatory science. Notably, our region-aware RAG agent performs cross-jurisdictional reasoning between Chinese and U.S. standards, supporting conflict resolution and applicability justification across regulatory frameworks.</p></details> |  |

While RAG systems aim to leverage such communications as a knowledge base, their effectiveness is limited by raw data challenges: support tickets are typically noisy, inconsistent, and incomplete, making direct retrieval suboptimal. Unlike existing RAG approaches that focus on runtime optimization, we introduce a novel offline-first methodology that transforms these communications into a structured knowledge base. Our key innovation is a LLMs-based multi-agent system orchestrating three specialized agents: Category Discovery for taxonomy creation, Categorization for ticket grouping, and Knowledge Synthesis for article generation. Applying our methodology to real-world support tickets with resolution notes and comments, our system creates a compact knowledge base - reducing total volume to just 3.4% of original ticket data while improving quality. Experiments demonstrate that our prebuilt knowledge base in RAG systems significantly outperforms traditional RAG implementations (48.74% vs. 38.60% helpful answers) and achieves a 77.4% reduction in unhelpful responses. By automating institutional knowledge capture that typically remains siloed in experts' heads, our solution translates to substantial operational efficiency: reducing support workload, accelerating resolution times, and creating self-improving systems that automatically resolve approximately 50% of future supply chain tickets. Our approach addresses a key gap in knowledge management by transforming transient communications into structured, reusable knowledge through intelligent offline processing rather than latency-inducing runtime architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted In Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on AI for Supply Chain: Today and Future @ 31st ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining V.2 (KDD 25), August 3, 2025, Toronto, ON, Canada.

However, they also exhibit inherent limitations, such as outdated knowledge and susceptibility to hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm to address these issues, but it also introduces new vulnerabilities. Recent efforts have focused on the security of RAG-based LLMs, yet existing attack methods face three critical challenges: (1) their effectiveness declines sharply when only a limited number of poisoned texts can be injected into the knowledge database, (2) they lack sufficient stealth, as the attacks are often detectable by anomaly detection systems, which compromises their effectiveness, and (3) they rely on heuristic approaches to generate poisoned texts, lacking formal optimization frameworks and theoretic guarantees, which limits their effectiveness and applicability. To address these issues, we propose coordinated Prompt-RAG attack (PR-attack), a novel optimization-driven attack that introduces a small number of poisoned texts into the knowledge database while embedding a backdoor trigger within the prompt. When activated, the trigger causes the LLM to generate pre-designed responses to targeted queries, while maintaining normal behavior in other contexts. This ensures both high effectiveness and stealth. We formulate the attack generation process as a bilevel optimization problem leveraging a principled optimization framework to develop optimal poisoned texts and triggers. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PR-Attack, achieving a high attack success rate even with a limited number of poisoned texts and significantly improved stealth compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

Given the challenges in continual learning with large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become the dominant way to introduce new information. However, its reliance on vector retrieval hinders its ability to mimic the dynamic and interconnected nature of human long-term memory. Recent RAG approaches augment vector embeddings with various structures like knowledge graphs to address some of these gaps, namely sense-making and associativity. However, their performance on more basic factual memory tasks drops considerably below standard RAG. We address this unintended deterioration and propose HippoRAG 2, a framework that outperforms standard RAG comprehensively on factual, sense-making, and associative memory tasks. HippoRAG 2 builds upon the Personalized PageRank algorithm used in HippoRAG and enhances it with deeper passage integration and more effective online use of an LLM. This combination pushes this RAG system closer to the effectiveness of human long-term memory, achieving a 7% improvement in associative memory tasks over the state-of-the-art embedding model while also exhibiting superior factual knowledge and sense-making memory capabilities.

However, numerous methodologies frequently neglect the calibration capabilities of large language models (LLMs), which capitalize on their robust in-context reasoning prowess. This work illustrates that providing LLMs with specific cues substantially improves their calibration efficacy, especially in multi-round calibrations. We present a new SGIC: Self-Guided Iterative Calibration Framework that employs uncertainty scores as a tool. Initially, this framework calculates uncertainty scores to determine both the relevance of each document to the query and the confidence level in the responses produced by the LLMs. Subsequently, it reevaluates these scores iteratively, amalgamating them with prior responses to refine calibration. Furthermore, we introduce an innovative approach for constructing an iterative self-calibration training set, which optimizes LLMs to efficiently harness uncertainty scores for capturing critical information and enhancing response accuracy. Our proposed framework significantly improves performance on both closed-source and open-weight LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Legal texts are characterized by a predefined hierarchical structure, an extensive network of references and a continuous evolution through multiple temporal versions. This temporal dynamism poses a significant challenge for standard AI systems, demanding a deterministic representation of the law at any given point in time. To address this, our approach grounds the knowledge graph construction in a formal, FRBRoo-inspired model that distinguishes abstract legal works from their concrete textual expressions. We introduce a multi-layered representation of Temporal Versions (capturing date-specific changes) and Language Versions (capturing linguistic variations). By modeling normative evolution as a precise sequence of these versioned entities, we enable the construction of a knowledge graph that serves as a verifiable "ground truth". This allows Large Language Models to generate responses based on accurate, context-aware, and point-in-time correct legal information, overcoming the risk of temporal inaccuracies. Through a detailed analysis of this formal Graph RAG approach and its application to legal norm datasets, this article aims to advance the field of Artificial Intelligence applied to Law, creating opportunities for more effective and reliable systems in legal research, legislative analysis, and decision support.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version enhances the theoretical underpinnings of the proposed Graph RAG methodology, including the introduction of a formal, FRBRoo-based model for versioning, and enabling multi-language support for both content and metadata</p></details> |

It shows that LLMs struggle to capture the root causes of vulnerabilities during vulnerability detection. To address this challenge, we propose enhancing LLMs with multi-dimensional vulnerability knowledge distilled from historical vulnerabilities and fixes. We design a novel knowledge-level Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework Vul-RAG, which improves LLMs with an accuracy increase of 16% - 24% in identifying vulnerable and patched code. Additionally, vulnerability knowledge generated by Vul-RAG can further (1) serve as high-quality explanations to improve manual detection accuracy (from 60% to 77%), and (2) detect 10 previously-unknown bugs in the recent Linux kernel release with 6 assigned CVEs.</p></details> |  |

The LiveRAG 2025 challenge explores RAG solutions to maximize accuracy on DataMorgana's QA pairs, which are composed of single-hop and multi-hop questions. The challenge provides access to sparse OpenSearch and dense Pinecone indices of the Fineweb 10BT dataset. It restricts model use to LLMs with up to 10B parameters and final answer generation with Falcon-3-10B. A judge-LLM assesses the submitted answers along with human evaluators. By exploring distinct retriever combinations and RAG solutions under the challenge conditions, our final solution emerged using InstructRAG in combination with a Pinecone retriever and a BGE reranker. Our solution achieved a correctness score of 1.13 and a faithfulness score of 0.55, placing fourth in the SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG Challenge.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 5 figures.

While large language models (LLMs) facilitate dynamic pedagogical interactions, hallucinations undermine confidence, trust, and instructional value. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) grounds LLM outputs in curated knowledge but requires a clear semantic link between user input and a knowledge base, which is often weak in student dialogue. We propose log-contextualized RAG (LC-RAG), which enhances RAG retrieval by using environment logs to contextualize collaborative discourse. Our findings show that LC-RAG improves retrieval over a discourse-only baseline and allows our collaborative peer agent, Copa, to deliver relevant, personalized guidance that supports students' critical thinking and epistemic decision-making in a collaborative computational modeling environment, C2STEM.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED25) Workshop on Epistemics and Decision-Making in AI-Supported Education</p></details> |
| **[Lightweight Relevance Grader in RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14084v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses limitations of large language models (LLMs) by leveraging a vector database to provide more accurate and up-to-date information. When a user submits a query, RAG executes a vector search to find relevant documents, which are then used to generate a response. However, ensuring the relevance of retrieved documents with a query would be a big challenge. To address this, a secondary model, known as a relevant grader, can be served to verify its relevance. To reduce computational requirements of a relevant grader, a lightweight small language model is preferred. In this work, we finetuned llama-3.2-1b as a relevant grader and achieved a significant increase in precision from 0.1301 to 0.7750. Its precision is comparable to that of llama-3.1-70b. Our code is available at https://github.com/taeheej/Lightweight-Relevance-Grader-in-RAG.</p></details> |  |

While RDF/OWL reasoners enable graph-based reasoning, they are limited to fragments of first-order logic, preventing deeper temporal and semantic analysis. This paper addresses both challenges by developing automatic historical event extraction models using multiple LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Llama 3.2) with three enhancement strategies: pure base generation, knowledge graph enhancement, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). We conducted comprehensive evaluations using historical texts from Thucydides. Our findings reveal that enhancement strategies optimize different performance dimensions rather than providing universal improvements. For coverage and historical breadth, base generation achieves optimal performance with Claude and GPT-4 extracting comprehensive events. However, for precision, RAG enhancement improves coordinate accuracy and metadata completeness. Model architecture fundamentally determines enhancement sensitivity: larger models demonstrate robust baseline performance with incremental RAG improvements, while Llama 3.2 shows extreme variance from competitive performance to complete failure. We then developed an automated translation pipeline converting extracted RDF representations into Coq proof assistant specifications, enabling higher-order reasoning beyond RDF capabilities including multi-step causal verification, temporal arithmetic with BC dates, and formal proofs about historical causation. The Coq formalization validates that RAG-discovered event types represent legitimate domain-specific semantic structures rather than ontological violations.</p></details> |  |

Traditional RAG pipelines often suffer from high latency and limited accuracy over massive, diverse datasets. DoTA-RAG addresses these challenges with a three-stage pipeline: query rewriting, dynamic routing to specialized sub-indexes, and multi-stage retrieval and ranking. We further enhance retrieval by evaluating and selecting a superior embedding model, re-embedding the large FineWeb-10BT corpus. Moreover, we create a diverse Q&A dataset of 500 questions generated via the DataMorgana setup across a broad range of WebOrganizer topics and formats. DoTA-RAG improves the answer correctness score from 0.752 (baseline, using LiveRAG pre-built vector store) to 1.478 while maintaining low latency, and it achieves a 0.929 correctness score on the Live Challenge Day. These results highlight DoTA-RAG's potential for practical deployment in domains requiring fast, reliable access to large and evolving knowledge sources.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIGIR...</summary><p>SIGIR LiveRAG 2025 (oral presentation)</p></details> |

Current approaches to supporting research idea generation often rely on generic large language models (LLMs). While LLMs are effective at aiding comprehension and summarization, they often fall short in guiding users toward practical research ideas due to their limitations. In this study, we present a novel structural framework for research ideation. Our framework, The Budget AI Researcher, uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) chains, vector databases, and topic-guided pairing to recombine concepts from hundreds of machine learning papers. The system ingests papers from nine major AI conferences, which collectively span the vast subfields of machine learning, and organizes them into a hierarchical topic tree. It uses the tree to identify distant topic pairs, generate novel research abstracts, and refine them through iterative self-evaluation against relevant literature and peer reviews, generating and refining abstracts that are both grounded in real-world research and demonstrably interesting. Experiments using LLM-based metrics indicate that our method significantly improves the concreteness of generated research ideas relative to standard prompting approaches. Human evaluations further demonstrate a substantial enhancement in the perceived interestingness of the outputs. By bridging the gap between academic data and creative generation, the Budget AI Researcher offers a practical, free tool for accelerating scientific discovery and lowering the barrier for aspiring researchers. Beyond research ideation, this approach inspires solutions to the broader challenge of generating personalized, context-aware outputs grounded in evolving real-world knowledge.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inten...</summary><p>Intended for AAAI's AI4Research Workshop</p></details> |

Data augmentation can potentially alleviate the data shortage, but augmenting vulnerable code is challenging and requires a generative solution that maintains vulnerability. Previous works have only focused on generating samples that contain single statements or specific types of vulnerabilities. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to solve various code generation and comprehension tasks with inspiring results, especially when fused with retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Therefore, we propose VulScribeR, a novel LLM-based solution that leverages carefully curated prompt templates to augment vulnerable datasets. More specifically, we explore three strategies to augment both single and multi-statement vulnerabilities, with LLMs, namely Mutation, Injection, and Extension. Our extensive evaluation across four vulnerability datasets and DLVD models, using three LLMs, show that our approach beats two SOTA methods Vulgen and VGX, and Random Oversampling (ROS) by 27.48%, 27.93%, and 15.41% in f1-score with 5K generated vulnerable samples on average, and 53.84%, 54.10%, 69.90%, and 40.93% with 15K generated vulnerable samples. Our approach demonstrates its feasibility for large-scale data augmentation by generating 1K samples at as cheap as US$ 1.88.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables, 3 prompt templates, 1 algorithm</p></details> |
| **[Bias Amplification in RAG: Poisoning Knowledge Retrieval to Steer LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11415v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Large Language Models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems can significantly enhance the performance of large language models by integrating external knowledge. However, RAG also introduces new security risks. Existing research focuses mainly on how poisoning attacks in RAG systems affect model output quality, overlooking their potential to amplify model biases. For example, when querying about domestic violence victims, a compromised RAG system might preferentially retrieve documents depicting women as victims, causing the model to generate outputs that perpetuate gender stereotypes even when the original query is gender neutral. To show the impact of the bias, this paper proposes a Bias Retrieval and Reward Attack (BRRA) framework, which systematically investigates attack pathways that amplify language model biases through a RAG system manipulation. We design an adversarial document generation method based on multi-objective reward functions, employ subspace projection techniques to manipulate retrieval results, and construct a cyclic feedback mechanism for continuous bias amplification. Experiments on multiple mainstream large language models demonstrate that BRRA attacks can significantly enhance model biases in dimensions. In addition, we explore a dual stage defense mechanism to effectively mitigate the impacts of the attack. This study reveals that poisoning attacks in RAG systems directly amplify model output biases and clarifies the relationship between RAG system security and model fairness. This novel potential attack indicates that we need to keep an eye on the fairness issues of the RAG system.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities to automate this translation. However, existing models still struggle with understanding domain-specific syntax and semantics. To enhance LLM performance in NL2SVA, we propose a customized retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework and a synthetic fine-tuning dataset that together improve LLM's performance. To further improve lightweight models over NL2SVA, our fine-tuning dataset provides prompt-guided explanations that teach LLMs the layer-by-layer construction process of concurrent SVAs, enabling supervised fine-tuning that greatly improves syntax and functionality accuracy. To evaluate the performance of LLMs over NL2SVA, we construct the largest evaluation dataset for NL2SVA, comprising 40 Verilog designs and 229 formally verified SVAs with detailed annotations. Experimental results show that our customized RAG framework increases the number of functionality matched SVAs by 58.42% over GPT-4o-mini, while Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct fine-tuned on our fine-tuning dataset and integrated with HybridRetrieval achieves a 59.05% over the base Qwen model.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is an exciting application of the pipeline architecture, where the final component generates a coherent answer for the users from the retrieved documents. In this demo paper, we describe how such RAG pipelines can be formulated in the declarative PyTerrier architecture, and the advantages of doing so. Our PyTerrier-RAG extension for PyTerrier provides easy access to standard RAG datasets and evaluation measures, state-of-the-art LLM readers, and using PyTerrier's unique operator notation, easy-to-build pipelines. We demonstrate the succinctness of indexing and RAG pipelines on standard datasets (including Natural Questions) and how to build on the larger PyTerrier ecosystem with state-of-the-art sparse, learned-sparse, and dense retrievers, and other neural rankers.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 3 tables, Accepted to SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

This study evaluates the efficacy of two augmentation strategies--Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE)--on compact Gemma LLMs of 1 billion and 4 billion parameters, within the context of a privacy-first personal assistant. We implement short-term memory via MongoDB and long-term semantic storage via Qdrant, orchestrated through FastAPI and LangChain, and expose the system through a React.js frontend. Across both model scales, RAG consistently reduces latency by up to 17\% and eliminates factual hallucinations when responding to user-specific and domain-specific queries. HyDE, by contrast, enhances semantic relevance--particularly for complex physics prompts--but incurs a 25--40\% increase in response time and a non-negligible hallucination rate in personal-data retrieval. Comparing 1 B to 4 B models, we observe that scaling yields marginal throughput gains for baseline and RAG pipelines, but magnifies HyDE's computational overhead and variability. Our findings position RAG as the pragmatic choice for on-device personal assistants powered by small-scale LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report as part of research project</p></details> |

While early RAG systems based on static pipelines have shown effectiveness in well-structured tasks, they struggle in real-world scenarios requiring complex reasoning, dynamic retrieval, and multi-modal integration. To address these challenges, the field has shifted toward Reasoning Agentic RAG, a paradigm that embeds decision-making and adaptive tool use directly into the retrieval process. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of Reasoning Agentic RAG methods, categorizing them into two primary systems: predefined reasoning, which follows fixed modular pipelines to boost reasoning, and agentic reasoning, where the model autonomously orchestrates tool interaction during inference. We analyze representative techniques under both paradigms, covering architectural design, reasoning strategies, and tool coordination. Finally, we discuss key research challenges and propose future directions to advance the flexibility, robustness, and applicability of reasoning agentic RAG systems. Our collection of the relevant research has been organized into a https://github.com/ByebyeMonica/Reasoning-Agentic-RAG.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods typically rely on a single source, either unstructured text or structured knowledge. Moreover, they lack cognitively inspired mechanisms for activating relevant knowledge. To address these issues, we propose KG-Infused RAG, a framework that integrates KGs into RAG systems to implement spreading activation, a cognitive process that enables concept association and inference. KG-Infused RAG retrieves KG facts, expands the query accordingly, and enhances generation by combining corpus passages with structured facts, enabling interpretable, multi-source retrieval grounded in semantic structure. We further improve KG-Infused RAG via preference learning on sampled key stages in the pipeline. Experiments on five QA benchmarks show that KG-Infused RAG consistently outperforms vanilla RAG (by 3.8% to 13.8%). Additionally, when integrated into Self-RAG, KG-Infused RAG brings further performance gains, demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility as a plug-and-play enhancement module for corpus-based RAG methods.</p></details> |  |

RAG systems combine traditional search capabilities with LLMs to generate comprehensive answers to user queries, ideally with accurate citations. However, in our experience of developing a RAG product, LLMs often struggle with source attribution, aligning with other industry studies reporting citation accuracy rates of only about 74% for popular generative search engines. To address this, we present efficient post-processing algorithms to improve citation accuracy in LLM-generated responses, with minimal impact on latency and cost. Our approaches cross-check generated citations against retrieved articles using methods including keyword + semantic matching, fine tuned model with BERTScore, and a lightweight LLM-based technique. Our experimental results demonstrate a relative improvement of 15.46% in the overall accuracy metrics of our RAG system. This significant enhancement potentially enables a shift from our current larger language model to a relatively smaller model that is approximately 12x more cost-effective and 3x faster in inference time, while maintaining comparable performance. This research contributes to enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of AI-generated content in information retrieval and summarization tasks which is critical to gain customer trust especially in commercial products.</p></details> |  |

Existing watermarking methods in RAG focus solely on textual knowledge, leaving image knowledge unprotected. In this work, we propose AQUA, the first watermark framework for image knowledge protection in Multimodal RAG systems. AQUA embeds semantic signals into synthetic images using two complementary methods: acronym-based triggers and spatial relationship cues. These techniques ensure watermark signals survive indirect watermark propagation from image retriever to textual generator, being efficient, effective and imperceptible. Experiments across diverse models and datasets show that AQUA enables robust, stealthy, and reliable copyright tracing, filling a key gap in multimodal RAG protection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why Uncertainty Estimation Methods Fall Short in RAG: An Axiomatic Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07459v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are valued for their strong performance across various tasks, but they also produce inaccurate or misleading outputs. Uncertainty Estimation (UE) quantifies the model's confidence and helps users assess response reliability. However, existing UE methods have not been thoroughly examined in scenarios like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), where the input prompt includes non-parametric knowledge. This paper shows that current UE methods cannot reliably assess correctness in the RAG setting. We further propose an axiomatic framework to identify deficiencies in existing methods and guide the development of improved approaches. Our framework introduces five constraints that an effective UE method should meet after incorporating retrieved documents into the LLM's prompt. Experimental results reveal that no existing UE method fully satisfies all the axioms, explaining their suboptimal performance in RAG. We further introduce a simple yet effective calibration function based on our framework, which not only satisfies more axioms than baseline methods but also improves the correlation between uncertainty estimates and correctness.</p></details> |  |

The information needs regarding datasets are implicitly embedded in particular research tasks, rather than explicitly expressed in search queries. However, existing scientific retrieval and question-answering (QA) datasets typically address straightforward questions, which do not align with the distribution of real-world research inquiries. To bridge this gap, we developed ScIRGen, a dataset generation framework for scientific QA \& retrieval that more accurately reflects the information needs of professional science researchers, and uses it to create a large-scale scientific retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) dataset with realistic queries, datasets and papers. Technically, we designed a dataset-oriented information extraction method that leverages academic papers to augment the dataset representation. We then proposed a question generation framework by employing cognitive taxonomy to ensure the quality of synthesized questions. We also design a method to automatically filter synthetic answers based on the perplexity shift of LLMs, which is highly aligned with human judgment of answers' validity. Collectively, these methodologies culminated in the creation of the 61k QA dataset, ScIRGen-Geo. We benchmarked representative methods on the ScIRGen-Geo dataset for their question-answering and retrieval capabilities, finding out that current methods still suffer from reasoning from complex questions. This work advances the development of more sophisticated tools to support the intricate information needs of the scientific community.</p></details> | KDD 2025 Accepted |

Our benchmark contains 2366 questions of diverse complexity, dynamism, and topics, and includes over 35K annotated passages retrieved from both private document sets and the Web, to reflect real-world RAG use cases. This makes it an ideal test bed to evaluate an LLM's ability to identify only the relevant information necessary to compose a response, or provide a deflective response when there is insufficient information. Evaluations of multiple state-of-the-art LLMs on GaRAGe show that the models tend to over-summarise rather than (a) ground their answers strictly on the annotated relevant passages (reaching at most a Relevance-Aware Factuality Score of 60%), or (b) deflect when no relevant grounding is available (reaching at most 31% true positive rate in deflections). The F1 in attribution to relevant sources is at most 58.9%, and we show that performance is particularly reduced when answering time-sensitive questions and when having to draw knowledge from sparser private grounding sources.</p></details> | ACL 2025 (Findings) |

However, existing RAG approaches predominantly rely on flat, similarity-based retrieval that fails to leverage the rich relational structure inherent in user-item interactions. We introduce LlamaRec-LKG-RAG, a novel single-pass, end-to-end trainable framework that integrates personalized knowledge graph context into LLM-based recommendation ranking. Our approach extends the LlamaRec architecture by incorporating a lightweight user preference module that dynamically identifies salient relation paths within a heterogeneous knowledge graph constructed from user behavior and item metadata. These personalized subgraphs are seamlessly integrated into prompts for a fine-tuned Llama-2 model, enabling efficient and interpretable recommendations through a unified inference step. Comprehensive experiments on ML-100K and Amazon Beauty datasets demonstrate consistent and significant improvements over LlamaRec across key ranking metrics (MRR, NDCG, Recall). LlamaRec-LKG-RAG demonstrates the critical value of structured reasoning in LLM-based recommendations and establishes a foundation for scalable, knowledge-aware personalization in next-generation recommender systems.

These knowledge databases may contain sensitive information that requires privacy protection. However, multimodal RAG systems inherently grant external users indirect access to such data, making them potentially vulnerable to privacy attacks, particularly membership inference attacks (MIAs). % Existing MIA methods targeting RAG systems predominantly focus on the textual modality, while the visual modality remains relatively underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose MrM, the first black-box MIA framework targeted at multimodal RAG systems. It utilizes a multi-object data perturbation framework constrained by counterfactual attacks, which can concurrently induce the RAG systems to retrieve the target data and generate information that leaks the membership information. Our method first employs an object-aware data perturbation method to constrain the perturbation to key semantics and ensure successful retrieval. Building on this, we design a counterfact-informed mask selection strategy to prioritize the most informative masked regions, aiming to eliminate the interference of model self-knowledge and amplify attack efficacy. Finally, we perform statistical membership inference by modeling query trials to extract features that reflect the reconstruction of masked semantics from response patterns. Experiments on two visual datasets and eight mainstream commercial visual-language models (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2) demonstrate that MrM achieves consistently strong performance across both sample-level and set-level evaluations, and remains robust under adaptive defenses.</p></details> |  |

BRIGHT is a recent and influential benchmark designed to evaluate complex multi-hop retrieval across diverse, high-reasoning domains. However, its practical effectiveness is limited by common web-crawled artifacts - such as content redundancy and semantic discontinuity - that impair retrieval accuracy and downstream reasoning. Notably, we find that such issues are concentrated in seven StackExchange-derived subdomains, while other domains (e.g., Coding and Theorem-based content) remain relatively clean. In this study, we present MARCUS, a multi-agent pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to systematically clean and re-chunk BRIGHT into a higher-quality corpus: BRIGHT-Plus. MARCUS applies dedicated agents for structural noise removal and semantic segmentation, preserving answer-bearing spans while improving contextual integrity. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that BRIGHT-Plus yields consistent and significant improvements in both retrieval accuracy and multi-hop reasoning across a diverse set of retrievers. We release both the BRIGHT-Plus corpus and the MARCUS pipeline to support future research on robust, reasoning-centric retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables.

However, this pipeline's exclusive reliance on entity-level extraction can lead to the misinterpretation or omission of latent yet critical information and relations. As a result, retrieved content may be irrelevant or contradictory, and essential knowledge may be excluded, exacerbating hallucination risks and degrading the fidelity of generated responses. To address these limitations, we introduce PankRAG, a framework that combines a globally aware, hierarchical query-resolution strategy with a novel dependency-aware reranking mechanism. PankRAG first constructs a multi-level resolution path that captures both parallel and sequential interdependencies within a query, guiding large language models (LLMs) through structured reasoning. It then applies its dependency-aware reranker to exploit the dependency structure among resolved sub-questions, enriching and validating retrieval results for subsequent sub-questions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that PankRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across multiple benchmarks, underscoring its robustness and generalizability.</p></details> |  |

However, they often suffer from inefficiency and rely on manually pre-defined query modes, limiting practical use. In this paper, we propose E^2GraphRAG, a streamlined graph-based RAG framework that improves both Efficiency and Effectiveness. During the indexing stage, E^2GraphRAG constructs a summary tree with large language models and an entity graph with SpaCy based on document chunks. We then construct bidirectional indexes between entities and chunks to capture their many-to-many relationships, enabling fast lookup during both local and global retrieval. For the retrieval stage, we design an adaptive retrieval strategy that leverages the graph structure to retrieve and select between local and global modes. Experiments show that E^2GraphRAG achieves up to 10 times faster indexing than GraphRAG and 100 times speedup over LightRAG in retrieval while maintaining competitive QA performance.</p></details> | 16 pages |

Many existing educational solutions rely on cloud-based infrastructure or proprietary tools, which are costly and may raise privacy concerns. Regulated industries with limited budgets require affordable, self-hosted solutions. We introduce an end-to-end, open-source framework leveraging small (3B-7B parameters), locally deployed LLMs for customized teaching material generation and assessment. Our system uniquely incorporates an interactive loop crucial for effective small-model refinement, and an auxiliary LLM verifier to mitigate jailbreaking risks, enhancing output reliability and safety. Utilizing Retrieval and Context Augmented Generation (RAG/CAG), it produces factually accurate, customized pedagogically-styled content. Deployed on-premises for data privacy and validated through an evaluation pipeline and a college physics pilot, our findings show that carefully engineered small LLM systems can offer robust, affordable, practical, and safe educator support, achieving utility comparable to larger models for targeted tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[ECoRAG: Evidentiality-guided Compression for Long Context RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05167v2)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in Open-Domain Question Answering (ODQA) by leveraging external documents through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To reduce RAG overhead, from longer context, context compression is necessary. However, prior compression methods do not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, which limit the performance in LLM-based RAG. We thus propose Evidentiality-guided RAG, or ECoRAG framework. ECoRAG improves LLM performance by compressing retrieved documents based on evidentiality, ensuring whether answer generation is supported by the correct evidence. As an additional step, ECoRAG reflects whether the compressed content provides sufficient evidence, and if not, retrieves more until sufficient. Experiments show that ECoRAG improves LLM performance on ODQA tasks, outperforming existing compression methods. Furthermore, ECoRAG is highly cost-efficient, as it not only reduces latency but also minimizes token usage by retaining only the necessary information to generate the correct answer. Code is available at https://github.com/ldilab/ECoRAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAGE: A Framework of Precise Retrieval for RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01713v3)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated significant proficiency in conducting question-answering (QA) tasks within a specified corpus. Nonetheless, numerous failure instances of RAG in QA still exist. These failures are not solely attributable to the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs); instead, they predominantly arise from the retrieval of inaccurate information for LLMs due to two limitations: (1) Current RAG methods segment the corpus without considering semantics, making it difficult to find relevant context due to impaired correlation between questions and the segments. (2) There is a trade-off between missing essential context with fewer context retrieved and getting irrelevant context with more context retrieved. In this paper, we introduce a RAG framework (SAGE), to overcome these limitations. First, to address the segmentation issue without considering semantics, we propose to train a semantic segmentation model. This model is trained to segment the corpus into semantically complete chunks. Second, to ensure that only the most relevant chunks are retrieved while the irrelevant ones are ignored, we design a chunk selection algorithm to dynamically select chunks based on the decreasing speed of the relevance score, leading to a more relevant selection. Third, to further ensure the precision of the retrieved chunks, we propose letting LLMs assess whether retrieved chunks are excessive or lacking and then adjust the amount of context accordingly. Experiments show that SAGE outperforms baselines by 61.25% in the quality of QA on average. Moreover, by avoiding retrieving noisy context, SAGE lowers the cost of the tokens consumed in LLM inference and achieves a 49.41% enhancement in cost efficiency on average. Additionally, our work offers valuable insights for boosting RAG.</p></details> |  |

Within financial sectors, modern enterprises increasingly rely on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to address complex compliance requirements in financial document workflows. However, existing solutions struggle to account for the inherent heterogeneity of data (e.g., text, tables, diagrams) and evolving nature of regulatory standards used in financial filings, leading to compromised accuracy in critical information extraction. We propose the FinSage framework as a solution, utilizing a multi-aspect RAG framework tailored for regulatory compliance analysis in multi-modal financial documents. FinSage introduces three innovative components: (1) a multi-modal pre-processing pipeline that unifies diverse data formats and generates chunk-level metadata summaries, (2) a multi-path sparse-dense retrieval system augmented with query expansion (HyDE) and metadata-aware semantic search, and (3) a domain-specialized re-ranking module fine-tuned via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to prioritize compliance-critical content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FinSage achieves an impressive recall of 92.51% on 75 expert-curated questions derived from surpasses the best baseline method on the FinanceBench question answering datasets by 24.06% in accuracy. Moreover, FinSage has been successfully deployed as financial question-answering agent in online meetings, where it has already served more than 1,200 people.</p></details> |  |

It leverages graphs to model the hierarchical structure between specific concepts, enabling more coherent and effective knowledge retrieval for accurate reasoning.Despite its conceptual promise, recent studies report that GraphRAG frequently underperforms vanilla RAG on many real-world tasks. This raises a critical question: Is GraphRAG really effective, and in which scenarios do graph structures provide measurable benefits for RAG systems? To address this, we propose GraphRAG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate GraphRAG models onboth hierarchical knowledge retrieval and deep contextual reasoning. GraphRAG-Bench features a comprehensive dataset with tasks of increasing difficulty, coveringfact retrieval, complex reasoning, contextual summarization, and creative generation, and a systematic evaluation across the entire pipeline, from graph constructionand knowledge retrieval to final generation. Leveraging this novel benchmark, we systematically investigate the conditions when GraphRAG surpasses traditional RAG and the underlying reasons for its success, offering guidelines for its practical application. All related resources and analyses are collected for the community at https://github.com/GraphRAG-Bench/GraphRAG-Benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Magic Mushroom: A Customizable Benchmark for Fine-grained Analysis of Retrieval Noise Erosion in RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03901v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external retrieved information, mitigating issues such as hallucination and outdated knowledge. However, RAG systems are highly sensitive to retrieval noise prevalent in real-world scenarios. Existing benchmarks fail to emulate the complex and heterogeneous noise distributions encountered in real-world retrieval environments, undermining reliable robustness assessment. In this paper, we define four categories of retrieval noise based on linguistic properties and noise characteristics, aiming to reflect the heterogeneity of noise in real-world scenarios. Building on this, we introduce Magic Mushroom, a benchmark for replicating "magic mushroom" noise: contexts that appear relevant on the surface but covertly mislead RAG systems. Magic Mushroom comprises 7,468 single-hop and 3,925 multi-hop question-answer pairs. More importantly, Magic Mushroom enables researchers to flexibly configure combinations of retrieval noise according to specific research objectives or application scenarios, allowing for highly controlled evaluation setups. We evaluate LLM generators of varying parameter scales and classic RAG denoising strategies under diverse noise distributions to investigate their performance dynamics during progressive noise encroachment. Our analysis reveals that both generators and denoising strategies have significant room for improvement and exhibit extreme sensitivity to noise distributions. Magic Mushroom emerges as a promising tool for evaluating and advancing noise-robust RAG systems, accelerating their widespread deployment in real-world applications. The Magic Mushroom benchmark is available at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aP5kyPuk4L-L_uoI6T9UhxuTyt8oMqjT/view?usp=sharing.</p></details> |  |
| **[MetaGen Blended RAG: Unlocking Zero-Shot Precision for Specialized Domain Question-Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18247v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) struggles with domain-specific enterprise datasets, often isolated behind firewalls and rich in complex, specialized terminology unseen by LLMs during pre-training. Semantic variability across domains like medicine, networking, or law hampers RAG's context precision, while fine-tuning solutions are costly, slow, and lack generalization as new data emerges. Achieving zero-shot precision with retrievers without fine-tuning still remains a key challenge. We introduce 'MetaGen Blended RAG', a novel enterprise search approach that enhances semantic retrievers through a metadata generation pipeline and hybrid query indexes using dense and sparse vectors. By leveraging key concepts, topics, and acronyms, our method creates metadata-enriched semantic indexes and boosted hybrid queries, delivering robust, scalable performance without fine-tuning. On the biomedical PubMedQA dataset, MetaGen Blended RAG achieves 82% retrieval accuracy and 77% RAG accuracy, surpassing all prior zero-shot RAG benchmarks and even rivaling fine-tuned models on that dataset, while also excelling on datasets like SQuAD and NQ. This approach redefines enterprise search using a new approach to building semantic retrievers with unmatched generalization across specialized domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[Through the Stealth Lens: Rethinking Attacks and Defenses in RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04390v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are vulnerable to attacks that inject poisoned passages into the retrieved set, even at low corruption rates. We show that existing attacks are not designed to be stealthy, allowing reliable detection and mitigation. We formalize stealth using a distinguishability-based security game. If a few poisoned passages are designed to control the response, they must differentiate themselves from benign ones, inherently compromising stealth. This motivates the need for attackers to rigorously analyze intermediate signals involved in generation$\unicode{x2014}$such as attention patterns or next-token probability distributions$\unicode{x2014}$to avoid easily detectable traces of manipulation. Leveraging attention patterns, we propose a passage-level score$\unicode{x2014}$the Normalized Passage Attention Score$\unicode{x2014}$used by our Attention-Variance Filter algorithm to identify and filter potentially poisoned passages. This method mitigates existing attacks, improving accuracy by up to $\sim 20 \%$ over baseline defenses. To probe the limits of attention-based defenses, we craft stealthier adaptive attacks that obscure such traces, achieving up to $35 \%$ attack success rate, and highlight the challenges in improving stealth.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoRe-MMRAG: Cross-Source Knowledge Reconciliation for Multimodal RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02544v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MMRAG) has been introduced to enhance Multimodal Large Language Models by incorporating externally retrieved multimodal knowledge, but it introduces two challenges: Parametric-Retrieved Knowledge Inconsistency (PRKI), where discrepancies between parametric and retrieved knowledge create uncertainty in determining reliability, and Visual-Textual Knowledge Inconsistency (VTKI), where misalignment between visual and textual sources disrupts entity representation. To address these challenges, we propose Cross-source knowledge \textbf{Re}conciliation for Multimodal RAG (CoRe-MMRAG), a novel end-to-end framework that effectively reconciles inconsistencies across knowledge sources. CoRe-MMRAG follows a four-stage pipeline: it first generates an internal response from parametric knowledge, then selects the most relevant multimodal evidence via joint similarity assessment, generates an external response, and finally integrates both to produce a reliable answer. Additionally, a specialized training paradigm enhances knowledge source discrimination, multimodal integration, and unified answer generation. Experiments on KB-VQA benchmarks show that CoRe-MMRAG achieves substantial improvements over baseline methods, achieving 5.6% and 9.3% performance gains on InfoSeek and Encyclopedic-VQA, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 Main</p></details> |

| **[IndicRAGSuite: Large-Scale Datasets and a Benchmark for Indian Language RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01615v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enable language models to access relevant information and generate accurate, well-grounded, and contextually informed responses. However, for Indian languages, the development of high-quality RAG systems is hindered by the lack of two critical resources: (1) evaluation benchmarks for retrieval and generation tasks, and (2) large-scale training datasets for multilingual retrieval. Most existing benchmarks and datasets are centered around English or high-resource languages, making it difficult to extend RAG capabilities to the diverse linguistic landscape of India. To address the lack of evaluation benchmarks, we create IndicMSMarco, a multilingual benchmark for evaluating retrieval quality and response generation in 13 Indian languages, created via manual translation of 1000 diverse queries from MS MARCO-dev set. To address the need for training data, we build a large-scale dataset of (question, answer, relevant passage) tuples derived from the Wikipedias of 19 Indian languages using state-of-the-art LLMs. Additionally, we include translated versions of the original MS MARCO dataset to further enrich the training data and ensure alignment with real-world information-seeking tasks.

| **[KET-RAG: A Cost-Efficient Multi-Granular Indexing Framework for Graph-RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09304v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-RAG constructs a knowledge graph from text chunks to improve retrieval in Large Language Model (LLM)-based question answering. It is particularly useful in domains such as biomedicine, law, and political science, where retrieval often requires multi-hop reasoning over proprietary documents. Some existing Graph-RAG systems construct KNN graphs based on text chunk relevance, but this coarse-grained approach fails to capture entity relationships within texts, leading to sub-par retrieval and generation quality. To address this, recent solutions leverage LLMs to extract entities and relationships from text chunks, constructing triplet-based knowledge graphs. However, this approach incurs significant indexing costs, especially for large document collections. To ensure a good result accuracy while reducing the indexing cost, we propose KET-RAG, a multi-granular indexing framework. KET-RAG first identifies a small set of key text chunks and leverages an LLM to construct a knowledge graph skeleton. It then builds a text-keyword bipartite graph from all text chunks, serving as a lightweight alternative to a full knowledge graph. During retrieval, KET-RAG searches both structures: it follows the local search strategy of existing Graph-RAG systems on the skeleton while mimicking this search on the bipartite graph to improve retrieval quality. We evaluate 13 solutions on three real-world datasets, demonstrating that KET-RAG outperforms all competitors in indexing cost, retrieval effectiveness, and generation quality. Notably, it achieves comparable or superior retrieval quality to Microsoft's Graph-RAG while reducing indexing costs by over an order of magnitude. Additionally, it improves the generation quality by up to 32.4% while lowering indexing costs by around 20%.</p></details> |  |

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have notably improved the open-domain QA's performance, how to efficiently handle enterprise-exclusive corpora and build domain-specific QA systems are still less-studied for industrial applications. In this paper, we propose a general and comprehensive framework based on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and facilitate the whole business process of establishing QA systems for IT operations and maintenance. In accordance with the prevailing RAG method, our proposed framework, named with RAG4ITOps, composes of two major stages: (1) Models Fine-tuning \& Data Vectorization, and (2) Online QA System Process. At the Stage 1, we leverage a contrastive learning method with two negative sampling strategies to fine-tune the embedding model, and design the instruction templates to fine-tune the LLM with a Retrieval Augmented Fine-Tuning method. At the Stage 2, an efficient process of QA system is built for serving. We collect enterprise-exclusive corpora from the domain of cloud computing, and the extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior results than counterparts on two kinds of QA tasks. Our experiment also provide a case for applying the RAG4ITOps to real-world enterprise-level applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2024 Industry Track</p></details> |
