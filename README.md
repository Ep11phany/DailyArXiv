| **[Beyond Simple Edits: X-Planner for Complex Instruction-Based Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05259v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent diffusion-based image editing methods have significantly advanced text-guided tasks but often struggle to interpret complex, indirect instructions. Moreover, current models frequently suffer from poor identity preservation, unintended edits, or rely heavily on manual masks. To address these challenges, we introduce X-Planner, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based planning system that effectively bridges user intent with editing model capabilities. X-Planner employs chain-of-thought reasoning to systematically decompose complex instructions into simpler, clear sub-instructions. For each sub-instruction, X-Planner automatically generates precise edit types and segmentation masks, eliminating manual intervention and ensuring localized, identity-preserving edits. Additionally, we propose a novel automated pipeline for generating large-scale data to train X-Planner which achieves state-of-the-art results on both existing benchmarks and our newly introduced complex editing benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://danielchyeh.github.io/x-planner/</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-Temporal LLM: Reasoning about Environments and Actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05258v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the significant recent progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), MLLMs still struggle to correctly answer prompts that require a holistic spatio-temporal understanding. Specifically, it is challenging to address prompts that refer to 1) the entirety of an environment that an agent equipped with an MLLM can operate in; and simultaneously also refer to 2) recent actions that just happened and are encoded in a video clip. However, such a holistic spatio-temporal understanding is important for agents operating in the real world. To address this issue, we first develop a framework to collect a large-scale dataset. Using the collected "Reasoning about Environments and Actions" (REA) dataset, we show that recent methods indeed struggle to correctly answer the prompts. To improve, we develop a "spatio-temporal LLM" (ST-LLM), a model equipped with projectors to improve both spatial understanding of an environment and temporal understanding of recent observations. On the collected REA data, we show that the proposed method significantly improves results compared to prior work.

| **[Evaluating Memory in LLM Agents via Incremental Multi-Turn Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05257v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent benchmarks for Large Language Model (LLM) agents primarily focus on evaluating reasoning, planning, and execution capabilities, while another critical component-memory, encompassing how agents memorize, update, and retrieve long-term information-is under-evaluated due to the lack of benchmarks. We term agents with memory mechanisms as memory agents. In this paper, we identify four core competencies essential for memory agents: accurate retrieval, test-time learning, long-range understanding, and conflict resolution. Existing datasets either rely on limited context lengths or are tailored for static, long-context settings like book-based QA, which do not reflect the interactive, multi-turn nature of memory agents that incrementally accumulate information. Furthermore, no existing benchmarks cover all four competencies. Therefore, we introduce MemoryAgentBench, a new benchmark specifically designed for memory agents. Our benchmark combines reformulated existing datasets with newly constructed ones, covering the above four memory competencies, providing a systematic and challenging testbed for assessing memory quality. We evaluate a diverse set of memory agents, ranging from simple context-based and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to advanced agents with external memory modules and tool integration. Empirical results reveal that current methods fall short of mastering all four competencies, underscoring the need for further research into comprehensive memory mechanisms for LLM agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 Pa...</summary><p>23 Pages, Y.

| **[Open Vision Reasoner: Transferring Linguistic Cognitive Behavior for Visual Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05255v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) stems from cognitive behaviors that emerge through reinforcement with verifiable rewards. This work investigates how to transfer this principle to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) to unlock advanced visual reasoning. We introduce a two-stage paradigm built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B: a massive linguistic cold-start fine-tuning, followed by multimodal reinforcement learning (RL) spanning nearly 1,000 steps, surpassing all previous open-source efforts in scale. This pioneering work reveals three fundamental insights: 1) Behavior transfer emerges surprisingly early in cold start due to linguistic mental imagery. 2) Cold start broadly memorizes visual behaviors, while RL critically discerns and scales up effective patterns. 3) Transfer strategically favors high-utility behaviors such as visual reflection. Our resulting model, Open-Vision-Reasoner (OVR), achieves state-of-the-art performance on a suite of reasoning benchmarks, including 95.3% on MATH500, 51.8% on MathVision and 54.6% on MathVerse. We release our model, data, and training dynamics to catalyze the development of more capable, behavior-aligned multimodal reasoners.</p></details> |  |
| **[Response Attack: Exploiting Contextual Priming to Jailbreak Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05248v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contextual priming, where earlier stimuli covertly bias later judgments, offers an unexplored attack surface for large language models (LLMs). We uncover a contextual priming vulnerability in which the previous response in the dialogue can steer its subsequent behavior toward policy-violating content. Building on this insight, we propose Response Attack, which uses an auxiliary LLM to generate a mildly harmful response to a paraphrased version of the original malicious query. They are then formatted into the dialogue and followed by a succinct trigger prompt, thereby priming the target model to generate harmful content. Across eight open-source and proprietary LLMs, RA consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art jailbreak techniques, achieving higher attack success rates. To mitigate this threat, we construct and release a context-aware safety fine-tuning dataset, which significantly reduces the attack success rate while preserving model capabilities. The code and data are available at https://github.com/Dtc7w3PQ/Response-Attack.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 9 figures.

| **[StreamVLN: Streaming Vision-and-Language Navigation via SlowFast Context Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05240v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) in real-world settings requires agents to process continuous visual streams and generate actions with low latency grounded in language instructions. While Video-based Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have driven recent progress, current VLN methods based on Video-LLM often face trade-offs among fine-grained visual understanding, long-term context modeling and computational efficiency. We introduce StreamVLN, a streaming VLN framework that employs a hybrid slow-fast context modeling strategy to support multi-modal reasoning over interleaved vision, language and action inputs. The fast-streaming dialogue context facilitates responsive action generation through a sliding-window of active dialogues, while the slow-updating memory context compresses historical visual states using a 3D-aware token pruning strategy. With this slow-fast design, StreamVLN achieves coherent multi-turn dialogue through efficient KV cache reuse, supporting long video streams with bounded context size and inference cost. Experiments on VLN-CE benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with stable low latency, ensuring robustness and efficiency in real-world deployment.

| **[OPeRA: A Dataset of Observation, Persona, Rationale, and Action for Evaluating LLMs on Human Online Shopping Behavior Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05606v3)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Can large language models (LLMs) accurately simulate the next web action of a specific user? While LLMs have shown promising capabilities in generating ``believable'' human behaviors, evaluating their ability to mimic real user behaviors remains an open challenge, largely due to the lack of high-quality, publicly available datasets that capture both the observable actions and the internal reasoning of an actual human user. To address this gap, we introduce OPERA, a novel dataset of Observation, Persona, Rationale, and Action collected from real human participants during online shopping sessions. OPERA is the first public dataset that comprehensively captures: user personas, browser observations, fine-grained web actions, and self-reported just-in-time rationales. We developed both an online questionnaire and a custom browser plugin to gather this dataset with high fidelity. Using OPERA, we establish the first benchmark to evaluate how well current LLMs can predict a specific user's next action and rationale with a given persona and <observation, action, rationale> history. This dataset lays the groundwork for future research into LLM agents that aim to act as personalized digital twins for human.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Super Weight in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07191v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works have shown a surprising result: a small fraction of Large Language Model (LLM) parameter outliers are disproportionately important to the quality of the model. LLMs contain billions of parameters, so these small fractions, such as 0.01%, translate to hundreds of thousands of parameters. In this work, we present an even more surprising finding: Pruning as few as a single parameter can destroy an LLM's ability to generate text -- increasing perplexity by 3 orders of magnitude and reducing zero-shot accuracy to guessing. We propose a data-free method for identifying such parameters, termed super weights, using a single forward pass through the model. We additionally find that these super weights induce correspondingly rare and large activation outliers, termed super activations. When preserved with high precision, super activations can improve simple round-to-nearest quantization to become competitive with state-of-the-art methods. For weight quantization, we similarly find that by preserving the super weight and clipping other weight outliers, round-to-nearest quantization can scale to much larger block sizes than previously considered. To facilitate further research into super weights, we provide an index of super weight coordinates for common, openly available LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Extended Inductive Reasoning for Personalized Preference Inference from Behavioral Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18071v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant success in complex reasoning tasks such as math and coding. In contrast to these tasks where deductive reasoning predominates, inductive reasoning-the ability to derive general rules from incomplete evidence, remains underexplored. This paper investigates extended inductive reasoning in LLMs through the lens of personalized preference inference, a critical challenge in LLM alignment where current approaches struggle to capture diverse user preferences. The task demands strong inductive reasoning capabilities as user preferences are typically embedded implicitly across various interaction forms, requiring models to synthesize consistent preference patterns from scattered signals. We propose AlignXplore, a model that leverages extended reasoning chains to enable systematic preference inference from behavioral signals in users' interaction histories. Such explicit preference articulation enables efficient streaming inference: when new behavioral signals emerge, the model can directly build upon previously inferred preference descriptions rather than reprocessing historical signals from scratch, while also supporting iterative refinement to the inferred preferences. We develop AlignXplore by combining cold-start training based on synthetic data with subsequent online reinforcement learning. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that AlignXplore achieves substantial improvements over the backbone model by an average of 15.49\% on in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks, while maintaining strong generalization ability across different input formats and downstream models. Further analyses establish best practices for preference inference learning through systematic comparison of reward modeling strategies, while revealing the emergence of human-like inductive reasoning patterns during training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Personalized Multi-Turn Dialogue with Curiosity Reward](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03206v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective conversational agents like large language models (LLMs) must personalize their interactions to adapt to user preferences, personalities, and attributes across diverse domains like education and healthcare. Current methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), often prioritize helpfulness and safety but fall short in fostering truly empathetic, adaptive, and personalized dialogues. Existing personalization approaches typically rely on extensive user history, limiting their effectiveness for new or context-limited users. To address these limitations, we propose leveraging a user model to incorporate a curiosity-based intrinsic reward into multi-turn RLHF. This novel reward mechanism encourages the LLM agent to actively infer user traits by optimizing conversations to improve its user model's accuracy. Consequently, the agent delivers more personalized interactions by learning more about the user. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness in two distinct domains: significantly improving personalization performance in a conversational recommendation task, and personalizing conversations for different learning styles in an educational setting. We show improved generalization capabilities compared to traditional multi-turn RLHF, all while maintaining conversation quality. Our method offers a promising solution for creating more personalized, adaptive, and engaging conversational agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reviewing Scientific Papers for Critical Problems With Reasoning LLMs: Baseline Approaches and Automatic Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23824v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models have sparked interest in utilizing them to aid the peer review process of scientific publication amid the peer review crisis. However, having AI models generate full reviews in the same way as human reviewers risks exacerbating the irresponsible use of LLM-generated reviews. As an alternative, we propose adopting LLMs as manuscript quality checkers. We introduce several baseline approaches and an extendable automatic evaluation framework using top reasoning LLMs as judges to tackle the difficulty of recruiting domain experts for manual evaluation. Utilizing papers withdrawn from arXiv, we validated our proposed methods with several leading reasoning LLMs from multiple vendors and assessed their performance and API costs for identifying critical errors and unsoundness problems in scientific papers. o3 exhibited the best problem identification performance among all models at a modest cost. This paper provides insights into document-based scientific understanding/reasoning and lays a foundation for future applications. Our dataset, code, and model outputs are publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Add r...</summary><p>Add results from new experiments; update discussion and GitHub link</p></details> |
| **[All in One: Visual-Description-Guided Unified Point Cloud Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05211v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified segmentation of 3D point clouds is crucial for scene understanding, but is hindered by its sparse structure, limited annotations, and the challenge of distinguishing fine-grained object classes in complex environments. Existing methods often struggle to capture rich semantic and contextual information due to limited supervision and a lack of diverse multimodal cues, leading to suboptimal differentiation of classes and instances. To address these challenges, we propose VDG-Uni3DSeg, a novel framework that integrates pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) and large language models (LLMs) to enhance 3D segmentation. By leveraging LLM-generated textual descriptions and reference images from the internet, our method incorporates rich multimodal cues, facilitating fine-grained class and instance separation. We further design a Semantic-Visual Contrastive Loss to align point features with multimodal queries and a Spatial Enhanced Module to model scene-wide relationships efficiently. Operating within a closed-set paradigm that utilizes multimodal knowledge generated offline, VDG-Uni3DSeg achieves state-of-the-art results in semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation, offering a scalable and practical solution for 3D understanding. Our code is available at https://github.com/Hanzy1996/VDG-Uni3DSeg.</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV2025 |

To enhance and benchmark the capabilities of LLMs, there is a need to develop large-scale resources focused on multilingual, local, and cultural contexts. In this study, we propose the NativQA framework, which can seamlessly construct large-scale, culturally and regionally aligned QA datasets in native languages. The framework utilizes user-defined seed queries and leverages search engines to collect location-specific, everyday information. It has been evaluated across 39 locations in 24 countries and in 7 languages -- ranging from extremely low-resource to high-resource languages -- resulting in over 300K Question-Answer (QA) pairs. The developed resources can be used for LLM benchmarking and further fine-tuning. The framework has been made publicly available for the community (https://gitlab.com/nativqa/nativqa-framework).</p></details> | <details><summary>LLMs,...</summary><p>LLMs, Native, Multilingual, Language Diversity, Contextual Understanding, Minority Languages, Culturally Informed, Foundation Models, Large Language Models</p></details> |

Existing environments typically focus on small-scale, fully observable, or low-complexity domains, limiting their utility for developing and assessing next-generation multi-agent Agentic AI frameworks. We introduce CREW-Wildfire, an open-source benchmark designed to close this gap. Built atop the human-AI teaming CREW simulation platform, CREW-Wildfire offers procedurally generated wildfire response scenarios featuring large maps, heterogeneous agents, partial observability, stochastic dynamics, and long-horizon planning objectives. The environment supports both low-level control and high-level natural language interactions through modular Perception and Execution modules. We implement and evaluate several state-of-the-art LLM-based multi-agent Agentic AI frameworks, uncovering significant performance gaps that highlight the unsolved challenges in large-scale coordination, communication, spatial reasoning, and long-horizon planning under uncertainty. By providing more realistic complexity, scalable architecture, and behavioral evaluation metrics, CREW-Wildfire establishes a critical foundation for advancing research in scalable multi-agent Agentic intelligence. All code, environments, data, and baselines will be released to support future research in this emerging domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our p...</summary><p>Our project website is at: http://generalroboticslab.com/CREW-Wildfire</p></details> |

However, the most powerful empathetic LSLMs are increasingly closed off, leaving the crucial details about the architecture, data and development opaque to researchers. Given the critical need for transparent research into the LSLMs and empathetic behavior, we present OpenS2S, a fully open-source, transparent and end-to-end LSLM designed to enable empathetic speech interactions. Based on our empathetic speech-to-text model BLSP-Emo, OpenS2S further employs a streaming interleaved decoding architecture to achieve low-latency speech generation. To facilitate end-to-end training, OpenS2S incorporates an automated data construction pipeline that synthesizes diverse, high-quality empathetic speech dialogues at low cost. By leveraging large language models to generate empathetic content and controllable text-to-speech systems to introduce speaker and emotional variation, we construct a scalable training corpus with rich paralinguistic diversity and minimal human supervision. We release the fully open-source OpenS2S model, including the dataset, model weights, pre-training and fine-tuning codes, to empower the broader research community and accelerate innovation in empathetic speech systems.

In particular, the transferability of adversarial examples remains an ongoing challenge. In this paper, we specifically analyze the manifestation of adversarial transferability among MLLMs and identify the key factors that influence this characteristic. We discover that the transferability of MLLMs exists in cross-LLM scenarios with the same vision encoder and indicate \underline{\textit{two key Factors}} that may influence transferability. We provide two semantic-level data augmentation methods, Adding Image Patch (AIP) and Typography Augment Transferability Method (TATM), which boost the transferability of adversarial examples across MLLMs. To explore the potential impact in the real world, we utilize two tasks that can have both negative and positive societal impacts: \ding{182} Harmful Content Insertion and \ding{183} Information Protection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |
| **[AI Generated Text Detection Using Instruction Fine-tuned Large Language and Transformer-Based Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05157v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) possess an extraordinary capability to produce text that is not only coherent and contextually relevant but also strikingly similar to human writing. They adapt to various styles and genres, producing content that is both grammatically correct and semantically meaningful. Recently, LLMs have been misused to create highly realistic phishing emails, spread fake news, generate code to automate cyber crime, and write fraudulent scientific articles. Additionally, in many real-world applications, the generated content including style and topic and the generator model are not known beforehand. The increasing prevalence and sophistication of artificial intelligence (AI)-generated texts have made their detection progressively more challenging. Various attempts have been made to distinguish machine-generated text from human-authored content using linguistic, statistical, machine learning, and ensemble-based approaches. This work focuses on two primary objectives Task-A, which involves distinguishing human-written text from machine-generated text, and Task-B, which attempts to identify the specific LLM model responsible for the generation. Both of these tasks are based on fine tuning of Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT_4o-mini), Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA) 3 8B, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). The fine-tuned version of GPT_4o-mini and the BERT model has achieved accuracies of 0.9547 for Task-A and 0.4698 for Task-B.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Interpretable Mnemonic Generation for Kanji Learning via Expectation-Maximization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05137v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning Japanese vocabulary is a challenge for learners from Roman alphabet backgrounds due to script differences. Japanese combines syllabaries like hiragana with kanji, which are logographic characters of Chinese origin. Kanji are also complicated due to their complexity and volume. Keyword mnemonics are a common strategy to aid memorization, often using the compositional structure of kanji to form vivid associations. Despite recent efforts to use large language models (LLMs) to assist learners, existing methods for LLM-based keyword mnemonic generation function as a black box, offering limited interpretability. We propose a generative framework that explicitly models the mnemonic construction process as driven by a set of common rules, and learn them using a novel Expectation-Maximization-type algorithm. Trained on learner-authored mnemonics from an online platform, our method learns latent structures and compositional rules, enabling interpretable and systematic mnemonics generation. Experiments show that our method performs well in the cold-start setting for new learners while providing insight into the mechanisms behind effective mnemonic creation.</p></details> |  |
| **[LERa: Replanning with Visual Feedback in Instruction Following](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05135v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models are increasingly used in robotics for task planning, but their reliance on textual inputs limits their adaptability to real-world changes and failures. To address these challenges, we propose LERa - Look, Explain, Replan - a Visual Language Model-based replanning approach that utilizes visual feedback. Unlike existing methods, LERa requires only a raw RGB image, a natural language instruction, an initial task plan, and failure detection - without additional information such as object detection or predefined conditions that may be unavailable in a given scenario. The replanning process consists of three steps: (i) Look, where LERa generates a scene description and identifies errors; (ii) Explain, where it provides corrective guidance; and (iii) Replan, where it modifies the plan accordingly. LERa is adaptable to various agent architectures and can handle errors from both dynamic scene changes and task execution failures. We evaluate LERa on the newly introduced ALFRED-ChaOS and VirtualHome-ChaOS datasets, achieving a 40% improvement over baselines in dynamic environments. In tabletop manipulation tasks with a predefined probability of task failure within the PyBullet simulator, LERa improves success rates by up to 67%. Further experiments, including real-world trials with a tabletop manipulator robot, confirm LERa's effectiveness in replanning. We demonstrate that LERa is a robust and adaptable solution for error-aware task execution in robotics. The code is available at https://lera-robo.github.io.</p></details> | IROS 2025 |
| **[An Evaluation of Large Language Models on Text Summarization Tasks Using Prompt Engineering Techniques](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05123v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance natural language processing with their ability to generate human-like text across a range of tasks. Despite the remarkable success of LLMs in Natural Language Processing (NLP), their performance in text summarization across various domains and datasets has not been comprehensively evaluated. At the same time, the ability to summarize text effectively without relying on extensive training data has become a crucial bottleneck. To address these issues, we present a systematic evaluation of six LLMs across four datasets: CNN/Daily Mail and NewsRoom (news), SAMSum (dialog), and ArXiv (scientific). By leveraging prompt engineering techniques including zero-shot and in-context learning, our study evaluates the performance using the ROUGE and BERTScore metrics. In addition, a detailed analysis of inference times is conducted to better understand the trade-off between summarization quality and computational efficiency. For Long documents, introduce a sentence-based chunking strategy that enables LLMs with shorter context windows to summarize extended inputs in multiple stages. The findings reveal that while LLMs perform competitively on news and dialog tasks, their performance on long scientific documents improves significantly when aided by chunking strategies. In addition, notable performance variations were observed based on model parameters, dataset properties, and prompt design. These results offer actionable insights into how different LLMs behave across task types, contributing to ongoing research in efficient, instruction-based NLP systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is an extended version of the work accepted for publication in the International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications (IJACSA), Volume 16, Issue 6, June 2025</p></details> |

While artificial intelligence (AI) offers a promising approach to CSI acquisition and utilization, existing methods largely depend on task-specific neural networks (NNs) that require expert-driven design and large training datasets, limiting their generalizability and practicality. To address these challenges, we propose LVM4CSI, a general and efficient framework that leverages the structural similarity between CSI and computer vision (CV) data to directly apply large vision models (LVMs) pre-trained on extensive CV datasets to wireless tasks without any fine-tuning, in contrast to large language model-based methods that generally necessitate fine-tuning. LVM4CSI maps CSI tasks to analogous CV tasks, transforms complex-valued CSI into visual formats compatible with LVMs, and integrates lightweight trainable layers to adapt extracted features to specific communication objectives. We validate LVM4CSI through three representative case studies, including channel estimation, human activity recognition, and user localization. Results demonstrate that LVM4CSI achieves comparable or superior performance to task-specific NNs, including an improvement exceeding 9.61 dB in channel estimation and approximately 40% reduction in localization error. Furthermore, it significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters and eliminates the need for task-specific NN design.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted for possible publication</p></details> |

Verifying high-level task plans before execution significantly reduces errors and enhance the overall performance of these systems. In this paper, we propose an architecture for automatically verifying high-level task plans before their execution in simulator or real-world environments. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), our approach consists of two key steps: first, the conversion of natural language instructions into Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), followed by a comprehensive analysis of action sequences. The module uses the reasoning capabilities of the LLM to evaluate logical coherence and identify potential gaps in the plan. Rigorous testing on datasets of varying complexity demonstrates the broad applicability of the module to household tasks. We contribute to improving the reliability and efficiency of task planning and addresses the critical need for robust pre-execution verification in autonomous systems.

However, RAG's reliance on ingesting external documents introduces new vulnerabilities. This paper exposes a critical security gap at the data loading stage, where malicious actors can stealthily corrupt RAG pipelines by exploiting document ingestion. We propose a taxonomy of 9 knowledge-based poisoning attacks and introduce two novel threat vectors -- Content Obfuscation and Content Injection -- targeting common formats (DOCX, HTML, PDF). Using an automated toolkit implementing 19 stealthy injection techniques, we test five popular data loaders, finding a 74.4% attack success rate across 357 scenarios. We further validate these threats on six end-to-end RAG systems -- including white-box pipelines and black-box services like NotebookLM and OpenAI Assistants -- demonstrating high success rates and critical vulnerabilities that bypass filters and silently compromise output integrity.

In that line of work, a combination of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on synthetic demonstrations and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is used for training Large Language Models to expend extra compute during inference in the form of "thoughts" expressed in natural language. In this paper, we propose to instead format these tokens as a multi-turn interaction trace with a stateful tool. At each turn, the new state of the tool is appended to the context of the model, whose job is to generate the tokens necessary to control the tool via a custom DSL. We benchmark this approach on the problem of repairing malfunctioning Python code, and show that this constrained setup allows for faster sampling of experience and a denser reward signal, allowing even models of size up to 3B parameters to learn how to proficiently expend additional compute on the task.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, includes appendix</p></details> |

A Mixed-Methods Study of User Attributes, Trust Dimensions, Task Context, and Societal Perceptions among University Students](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05046v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This mixed-methods inquiry examined four domains that shape university students' trust in ChatGPT: user attributes, seven delineated trust dimensions, task context, and perceived societal impact. Data were collected through a survey of 115 UK undergraduate and postgraduate students and four complementary semi-structured interviews. Behavioural engagement outweighed demographics: frequent use increased trust, whereas self-reported understanding of large-language-model mechanics reduced it. Among the dimensions, perceived expertise and ethical risk were the strongest predictors of overall trust; ease of use and transparency had secondary effects, while human-likeness and reputation were non-significant. Trust was highly task-contingent; highest for coding and summarising, lowest for entertainment and citation generation, yet confidence in ChatGPT's referencing ability, despite known inaccuracies, was the single strongest correlate of global trust, indicating automation bias. Computer-science students surpassed peers only in trusting the system for proofreading and writing, suggesting technical expertise refines rather than inflates reliance. Finally, students who viewed AI's societal impact positively reported the greatest trust, whereas mixed or negative outlooks dampened confidence. These findings show that trust in ChatGPT hinges on task verifiability, perceived competence, ethical alignment and direct experience, and they underscore the need for transparency, accuracy cues and user education when deploying LLMs in academic settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 11 tables, 6 figures</p></details> |

Yet, these advances come with a significant challenge: the high cost of model serving. To mitigate these costs, consumer-grade GPUs emerge as a more affordable alternative. This presents an opportunity for more cost-efficient LLM serving by leveraging these GPUs. However, it is non-trivial to achieve high-efficiency LLM serving on consumer-grade GPUs, mainly due to two challenges: 1) these GPUs are often deployed in limited network conditions; 2) these GPUs often exhibit heterogeneity in host systems. To address these challenges, we present MoLink, a distributed LLM serving system for large models. It incorporates several key techniques, enabling efficient LLM serving on heterogeneous and weakly connected consumer-grade GPUs. Our experiments demonstrate that it achieves throughput improvements of up to 458\% and cost-profit margin improvements of up to 151\%, compared to state-of-the-art systems. MoLink allows users on Windows, Linux, and containerized VMs to seamlessly integrate GPUs with just a few lines of code over Ethernet or public networks. Currently, it supports 18 mainstream architectures of open-source large language models.</p></details> |  |

A Systematic Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19794v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise in automating data analysis tasks, yet open-source models face significant limitations in these kinds of reasoning-intensive scenarios. In this work, we investigate strategies to enhance the data analysis capabilities of open-source LLMs. By curating a seed dataset of diverse, realistic scenarios, we evaluate models across three dimensions: data understanding, code generation, and strategic planning. Our analysis reveals three key findings: (1) Strategic planning quality serves as the primary determinant of model performance; (2) Interaction design and task complexity significantly influence reasoning capabilities; (3) Data quality demonstrates a greater impact than diversity in achieving optimal performance. We leverage these insights to develop a data synthesis methodology, demonstrating significant improvements in open-source LLMs' analytical reasoning capabilities.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[Beyond Scaling Curves: Internal Dynamics of Neural Networks Through the NTK Lens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05035v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling laws offer valuable insights into the relationship between neural network performance and computational cost, yet their underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this work, we empirically analyze how neural networks behave under data and model scaling through the lens of the neural tangent kernel (NTK). This analysis establishes a link between performance scaling and the internal dynamics of neural networks. Our findings of standard vision tasks show that similar performance scaling exponents can occur even though the internal model dynamics show opposite behavior. This demonstrates that performance scaling alone is insufficient for understanding the underlying mechanisms of neural networks. We also address a previously unresolved issue in neural scaling: how convergence to the infinite-width limit affects scaling behavior in finite-width models. To this end, we investigate how feature learning is lost as the model width increases and quantify the transition between kernel-driven and feature-driven scaling regimes. We identify the maximum model width that supports feature learning, which, in our setups, we find to be more than ten times smaller than typical large language model widths.</p></details> |  |

Our experiments demonstrate that ConversaSynth effectively generates highquality synthetic audio datasets, which can significantly enhance the training and evaluation of models for audio tagging, audio classification, and multi-speaker speech recognition. The results indicate that the synthetic datasets generated by ConversaSynth exhibit substantial diversity and realism, making them suitable for developing robust, adaptable audio-based AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted at the WI-IAT'24.

| **[Relative Overfitting and Accept-Reject Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07783v4)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) currently faces significant challenges. Model assembly is widely considered a promising solution to break through these performance bottlenecks. However, current ensembling methods are primarily guided by the statistical expectation that combining multiple models over large samples will lead to performance gains. We propose an ensemble framework that transitions from such stochastic, sample-dependent methods to a regular, controllable approach based on fine-grained model segmentation. This regularity governs how models are segmented to ensure performance improvement, how the magnitude of this improvement varies with model selection, and what factors determine its theoretical maximum. To formalize this pattern, we introduce the concept of'relative overfitting,' which is derived from the performance discrepancies between constituent models and builds a bridge between ensemble outcomes and the inherent attributes of these models. We detail the patterns of this framework within the domain of NLP and briefly describe its extensibility to other fields, such as computer vision (CV) and AI for science. Our approach was validated using both custom-built and pre-trained mainstream models across diverse benchmarks, including language modeling, long-context tasks, and question-answering (QA). The results indicate that the ensemble rules we proposed are generally effective and that we provide a rigorous proof of these rules in certain experimental scenarios. The proposed framework offers a new perspective for understanding ensemble theory and provides a systematic approach to addressing the performance bottlenecks of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Co-DETECT starts with an initial, sketch-level codebook and dataset provided by a domain expert, then leverages the LLM to annotate the data and identify edge cases that are not well described by the initial codebook. Specifically, Co-DETECT flags challenging examples, induces high-level, generalizable descriptions of edge cases, and assists user in incorporating edge case handling rules to improve the codebook. This iterative process enables more effective handling of nuanced phenomena through compact, generalizable annotation rules. Extensive user study, qualitative and quantitative analyses prove the effectiveness of Co-DETECT.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Autonomy to Agency: Agentic Vehicles for Human-Centered Mobility Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04996v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomy, from the Greek autos (self) and nomos (law), refers to the capacity to operate according to internal rules without external control. Accordingly, autonomous vehicles (AuVs) are defined as systems capable of perceiving their environment and executing preprogrammed tasks independently of external input. However, both research and real-world deployments increasingly showcase vehicles that demonstrate behaviors beyond this definition (including the SAE levels 1 to 6), such as interaction with humans and machines, goal adaptation, contextual reasoning, external tool use, and long-term planning, particularly with the integration of large language models (LLMs) and agentic AI systems. These developments reveal a conceptual gap between technical autonomy and the broader cognitive and social capabilities needed for future human-centered mobility systems. To address this, we introduce the concept of agentic vehicles (AgVs), referring to vehicles that integrate agentic AI to reason, adapt, and interact within complex environments. This paper presents a systems-level framework to characterize AgVs, focusing on their cognitive and communicative layers and differentiating them from conventional AuVs. It synthesizes relevant advances in agentic AI, robotics, multi-agent systems, and human-machine interaction, and highlights how agentic AI, through high-level reasoning and tool use, can function not merely as computational tools but as interactive agents embedded in mobility ecosystems. The paper concludes by identifying key challenges in the development and governance of AgVs, including safety, real-time control, public acceptance, ethical alignment, and regulatory frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[FUDOKI: Discrete Flow-based Unified Understanding and Generation via Kinetic-Optimal Velocities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20147v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed the emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that unify visual understanding and image generation within a single framework. However, most existing MLLMs rely on autoregressive (AR) architectures, which impose inherent limitations on future development, such as the raster-scan order in image generation and restricted reasoning abilities in causal context modeling. In this work, we challenge the dominance of AR-based approaches by introducing FUDOKI, a unified multimodal model purely based on discrete flow matching, as an alternative to conventional AR paradigms. By leveraging metric-induced probability paths with kinetic optimal velocities, our framework goes beyond the previous masking-based corruption process, enabling iterative refinement with self-correction capability and richer bidirectional context integration during generation. To mitigate the high cost of training from scratch, we initialize FUDOKI from pre-trained AR-based MLLMs and adaptively transition to the discrete flow matching paradigm. Experimental results show that FUDOKI achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art AR-based MLLMs across both visual understanding and image generation tasks, highlighting its potential as a foundation for next-generation unified multimodal models. Furthermore, we show that applying test-time scaling techniques to FUDOKI yields significant performance gains, further underscoring its promise for future enhancement through reinforcement learning.</p></details> | 37 pages, 12 figures |

However, current SDL implementations rely on rigid protocols that fail to capture the adaptability and intuition of expert scientists in dynamic experimental settings. We introduce Artificially Intelligent Lab Assistant (AILA), a framework automating atomic force microscopy through LLM driven agents. Further, we develop AFMBench a comprehensive evaluation suite challenging AI agents across the complete scientific workflow from experimental design to results analysis. We find that state of the art models struggle with basic tasks and coordination scenarios. Notably, Claude 3.5 sonnet performs unexpectedly poorly despite excelling in materials domain question answering (QA) benchmarks, revealing that domain specific QA proficiency does not necessarily translate to effective agentic capabilities. Additionally, we observe that LLMs can deviate from instructions, raising safety alignment concerns for SDL applications. Our ablations reveal that multi agent frameworks outperform single-agent architectures. We also observe significant prompt fragility, where slight modifications in prompt structure cause substantial performance variations in capable models like GPT 4o. Finally, we evaluate AILA's effectiveness in increasingly advanced experiments AFM calibration, feature detection, mechanical property measurement, graphene layer counting, and indenter detection. Our findings underscore the necessity for rigorous benchmarking protocols and prompt engineering strategies before deploying AI laboratory assistants in scientific research environments.</p></details> |  |

Alignment for Answerability in Video Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04976v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the broader context of deep learning, Multimodal Large Language Models have achieved significant breakthroughs by leveraging powerful Large Language Models as a backbone to align different modalities into the language space. A prime exemplification is the development of Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs). While numerous advancements have been proposed to enhance the video understanding capabilities of these models, they are predominantly trained on questions generated directly from video content. However, in real-world scenarios, users often pose questions that extend beyond the informational scope of the video, highlighting the need for Video-LLMs to assess the relevance of the question. We demonstrate that even the best-performing Video-LLMs fail to reject unfit questions-not necessarily due to a lack of video understanding, but because they have not been trained to identify and refuse such questions. To address this limitation, we propose alignment for answerability, a framework that equips Video-LLMs with the ability to evaluate the relevance of a question based on the input video and appropriately decline to answer when the question exceeds the scope of the video, as well as an evaluation framework with a comprehensive set of metrics designed to measure model behavior before and after alignment. Furthermore, we present a pipeline for creating a dataset specifically tailored for alignment for answerability, leveraging existing video-description paired datasets.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

However, deploying LLMs at scale -- processing millions to billions of rows -- remains prohibitively expensive in computation and memory. We present IOLM-DB, a novel system that makes LLM-enhanced database queries practical through query-specific model optimization. Instead of using general-purpose LLMs, IOLM-DB generates lightweight, specialized models tailored to each query's specific needs using representative data samples. IOLM-DB reduces model footprints by up to 76% and increases throughput by up to 3.31$\times$ while maintaining accuracy through aggressive compression techniques, including quantization, sparsification, and structural pruning. We further show how our approach enables higher parallelism on existing hardware and seamlessly supports caching and batching strategies to reduce overheads. Our prototype demonstrates that leveraging LLM queries inside analytics systems is feasible at scale, opening new possibilities for future OLAP applications.</p></details> |  |

This progress is bottlenecked by a critical evaluation gap: established benchmarks focus on algorithmic correctness and are blind to the visual fidelity and interactive integrity that define modern user experiences. To bridge this gap, we introduce ArtifactsBench, a new benchmark and paradigm for the automated, multimodal evaluation of visual code generation. Our framework programmatically renders each generated artifact and captures its dynamic behavior through temporal screenshots. This visual evidence, alongside the source code, is then assessed by a Multimodal LLM (MLLM)-as-Judge, which is rigorously guided by a fine-grained, per-task checklist to ensure holistic and reproducible scoring. We construct a new benchmark of 1,825 diverse tasks and evaluate over 30 leading LLMs. Our automated evaluation achieves a striking 94.4% ranking consistency with WebDev Arena, the gold-standard for human preference in web development, and over 90% pairwise agreement with human experts. This establishes ArtifactsBench as the first framework to reliably automate the assessment of human-perceived quality at scale. Our analysis provides a high-resolution map of the current SOTA, revealing that generalist models often outperform domain-specific ones. We open-source ArtifactsBench, including the benchmark, evaluation harness, and baseline results at https://artifactsbenchmark.github.io/, to provide the community with a scalable and accurate tool to accelerate the development of user-centric generative models.</p></details> |  |

These are outputs that contradict or misrepresent input semantics, posing a critical challenge to the reliability and factual consistency. Existing methods often rely on external verification or post-hoc correction, lacking an internal mechanism to validate outputs directly during training. To bridge this gap, we propose ReLoop, a unified closed-loop training framework that encourages multimodal consistency for cross-modal understanding in MLLMs. ReLoop adopts a ring-shaped structure that integrates three complementary consistency feedback mechanisms, obliging MLLMs to "seeing twice and thinking backwards". Specifically, ReLoop employs the frozen Consistency Feedback Plugin (CFP), comprising semantic reconstruction, visual description, and an attention supervision module for attention alignment. These components collectively enforce semantic reversibility, visual consistency, and interpretable attention, enabling the model to correct its outputs during training. Extensive evaluations and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of ReLoop in reducing hallucination rates across multiple benchmarks, establishing a robust method for hallucination mitigation in MLLMs. We will release our source code and data in the camera-ready version.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages,6 figures,5 tables</p></details> |

In distributed AI systems, DSE plays a crucial role in identifying hard-to-detect bugs, especially those arising from complex network communication patterns. However, traditional approaches to symbolic execution are often hindered by scalability issues and inefficiencies, particularly in large-scale systems. This paper introduces LIFT (Large-language-model Integrated Functional-equivalent-IR Transformation), a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the optimization of Intermediate Representations (IRs) in symbolic execution. LIFT addresses the challenges of symbolic execution by providing a scalable, context-sensitive solution for IR transformation. The framework consists of two phases: IR Analysis and Optimization, where LLMs optimize time-intensive IR blocks, and Symbolic Execution and Validation, which includes benchmarking and semantic verification to ensure correctness and generalizability. Experiments on real-world binaries demonstrated significant performance improvements, including a 53.5\% reduction in execution time for bigtest and a 10.24\% reduction for random, along with reductions in IR statements, PUT instructions, and temporary variables. These results demonstrate that LLMs simplify IRs while maintaining functional correctness, enhancing symbolic execution in distributed AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM SIGCOMM 2025 - 2nd Workshop on Networks for AI Computing (NAIC). 7 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, their capacity to comprehend human-centric video data remains underexplored, primarily due to the absence of comprehensive and high-quality evaluation benchmarks. Existing human-centric benchmarks predominantly emphasize video generation quality and action recognition, while overlooking essential perceptual and cognitive abilities required in human-centered scenarios. Furthermore, they are often limited by single-question paradigms and overly simplistic evaluation metrics. To address above limitations, we propose a modern HV-MMBench, a rigorously curated benchmark designed to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric video understanding. Compared to existing human-centric video benchmarks, our work offers the following key features: (1) Diverse evaluation dimensions: HV-MMBench encompasses 15 tasks, ranging from basic attribute perception (e.g., age estimation, emotion recognition) to advanced cognitive reasoning (e.g., social relationship prediction, intention prediction), enabling comprehensive assessment of model capabilities; (2) Varied data types: The benchmark includes multiple-choice, fill-in-blank, true/false, and open-ended question formats, combined with diverse evaluation metrics, to more accurately and robustly reflect model performance; (3) Multi-domain video coverage: The benchmark spans 50 distinct visual scenarios, enabling comprehensive evaluation across fine-grained scene variations; (4) Temporal coverage: The benchmark covers videos from short-term (10 seconds) to long-term (up to 30min) durations, supporting systematic analysis of models temporal reasoning abilities across diverse contextual lengths.</p></details> | Under review |

Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), an efficient variant of PPO that lowers RL's computational cost, still faces limited exploration, low sample efficiency and instability, constraining its performance on complex reasoning tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce EFRame, an Exploration-Filter-Replay framework that systematically augments GRPO along three critical dimensions. EFRame performs additional rollouts to explore high-quality trajectories, applies online filtering to eliminate low-quality samples that introduce noise and variance, and leverages experience replay to repeatedly exploit rare but informative samples. EFRame establishes a complete and stable learning cycle, guiding the model through a structured transition from exploration to convergence. Our experiments across a variety of reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that EFRame not only improves the robustness and efficiency of training, but also enables access to deeper reasoning capabilities that remain unattainable under vanilla GRPO. Furthermore, EFRame not only enables fine-grained categorization of training samples for deeper insight into their contributions, but also introduces an efficient and precise mechanism for entropy control, which is critical for balancing exploration and convergence in RL training. Our code is available at https://github.com/597358816/EFRame.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emergent Semantics Beyond Token Embeddings: Transformer LMs with Frozen Visual Unicode Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04886v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the locus of semantic representation in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for interpretability and architectural innovation. The dominant paradigm posits that trainable input embeddings serve as foundational "meaning vectors." This paper challenges that view. We construct Transformer models where the embedding layer is entirely frozen, with vectors derived not from data, but from the visual structure of Unicode glyphs. These non-semantic, precomputed visual embeddings are fixed throughout training. Our method is compatible with any tokenizer, including a novel Unicode-centric tokenizer we introduce to ensure universal text coverage. Despite the absence of trainable, semantically initialized embeddings, our models converge, generate coherent text, and, critically, outperform architecturally identical models with trainable embeddings on the MMLU reasoning benchmark. We attribute this to "representational interference" in conventional models, where the embedding layer is burdened with learning both structural and semantic features. Our results indicate that high-level semantics are not inherent to input embeddings but are an emergent property of the Transformer's compositional architecture and data scale. This reframes the role of embeddings from meaning containers to structural primitives. We release all code and models to foster further research.</p></details> |  |

Current large language models (LLMs), despite their advancements, exhibit notable limitations in medical applications, particularly in conducting effective multi-turn dialogues and proactive questioning. These shortcomings hinder their practical application and effectiveness in simulating real-world diagnostic scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose DoPI, a novel LLM system specifically designed for the TCM domain. The DoPI system introduces a collaborative architecture comprising a guidance model and an expert model. The guidance model conducts multi-turn dialogues with patients and dynamically generates questions based on a knowledge graph to efficiently extract critical symptom information. Simultaneously, the expert model leverages deep TCM expertise to provide final diagnoses and treatment plans. Furthermore, this study constructs a multi-turn doctor-patient dialogue dataset to simulate realistic consultation scenarios and proposes a novel evaluation methodology that does not rely on manually collected real-world consultation data. Experimental results show that the DoPI system achieves an accuracy rate of 84.68 percent in interrogation outcomes, significantly enhancing the model's communication ability during diagnosis while maintaining professional expertise.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods rely on separate modules for each modality, with limited exploration of unified generative architectures. In addition, many are confined to a single task and small-scale datasets. To overcome these limitations, we introduce UniForm, a unified multi-task diffusion transformer that generates both audio and visual modalities in a shared latent space. By using a unified denoising network, UniForm captures the inherent correlations between sound and vision. Additionally, we propose task-specific noise schemes and task tokens, enabling the model to support multiple tasks with a single set of parameters, including video-to-audio, audio-to-video and text-to-audio-video generation. Furthermore, by leveraging large language models and a large-scale text-audio-video combined dataset, UniForm achieves greater generative diversity than prior approaches. Experiments show that UniForm achieves performance close to the state-of-the-art single-task models across three generation tasks, with generated content that is not only highly aligned with real-world data distributions but also enables more diverse and fine-grained generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our d...</summary><p>Our demos are available at https://uniform-t2av.github.io/</p></details> |

However, it is difficult to automatically derive properties from natural language requirements. SpecVerify addresses this challenge by integrating large language models (LLMs) with formal verification tools, providing a more flexible mechanism for expressing requirements. This framework combines Claude 3.5 Sonnet with the ESBMC verifier to form an automated workflow. Evaluated on nine cyber-physical systems from Lockheed Martin, SpecVerify achieves 46.5% verification accuracy, comparable to NASA's CoCoSim, but with lower false positives. Our framework formulates assertions that extend beyond the expressive power of LTL and identifies falsifiable cases that are missed by more traditional methods. Counterexample analysis reveals CoCoSim's limitations stemming from model connection errors and numerical approximation issues. While SpecVerify advances verification automation, our comparative study of Claude, ChatGPT, and Llama shows that high-quality requirements documentation and human monitoring remain critical, as models occasionally misinterpret specifications. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can significantly reduce the barriers to formal verification, while highlighting the continued importance of human-machine collaboration in achieving optimal results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in 2025 IEEE 33rd International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE)</p></details> |

While recent advances in deep learning have improved the performance, TOD systems often struggle in low-resource scenarios with limited labeled data. To address this challenge, we propose Spec-TOD, a novel framework designed to train an end-to-end TOD system with limited data. Spec-TOD introduces two main innovations: (i) a novel specialized end-to-end TOD framework that incorporates explicit task instructions for instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs), and (ii) an efficient training strategy that leverages lightweight, specialized LLMs to achieve strong performance with minimal supervision. Experiments on the MultiWOZ dataset, a widely used TOD benchmark, demonstrate that Spec-TOD achieves competitive results while significantly reducing the need for labeled data. These findings highlight the potential of the proposed framework in advancing efficient and effective TOD systems in low-resource settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGdial 2025</p></details> |

This prevents adaptation to diverse real-world needs-from conciseness in one task to detailed explanations in another. The standard practice of collecting task-specific preference data and retraining reward models is resource-intensive, often producing biased rewards, and limits practical application. We introduce generalizable, principle-following reward models. We propose that RMs should understand and adhere to dynamically provided natural language specifications of reward principles, similar to instruction-following in LLMs. To measure this capability, we develop RABench, a comprehensive benchmark for RMs focusing on generalization across diverse principles. Evaluations on RABench reveal poor generalization of current RMs. As a solution, we present RewardAnything, a novel RM designed and trained to explicitly follow natural language principles. We achieve SotA performance with RewardAnything in traditional RM benchmark simply by specifying a well-defined principle, and results on RABench show we excel in adapting to novel principles without retraining. Furthermore, RewardAnything integrates seamlessly with existing RLHF methods and we show by a case study on how to automatically and efficiently align LLMs with only natural language principles.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 9 figures, Code & model weights available at: https://zhuohaoyu.github.io/RewardAnything</p></details> |

Consequently, the outstanding ranking performance of PRP has remained unreachable for most real-world ranking applications. In this work, we propose to harness the effectiveness of PRP through pairwise distillation. Specifically, we distill a pointwise student ranker from pairwise teacher labels generated by PRP, resulting in an efficient student model that retains the performance of PRP with substantially lower computational costs. Furthermore, we find that the distillation process can be made sample-efficient: with only 2% of pairs, we are able to obtain the same performance as using all pairs for teacher labels. Thus, our novel approach provides a solution to harness the ranking performance of PRP without incurring high computational costs during both distillation and serving.</p></details> | <details><summary>ReNeu...</summary><p>ReNeuIR 2025 (at SIGIR 2025) - 4th Workshop on Reaching Efficiency in Neural Information Retrieval, July 17, 2025, Padua, Italy</p></details> |

The use of LLMs for this task has several advantages over existing machine learning-based solutions such as not requiring a large training dataset and the ability to utilize free-text incident logs. We propose a fully LLM-based solution that predicts the incident impact using a combination of traffic features and LLM-extracted incident features. A key ingredient of this solution is an effective method of selecting examples for the LLM's in-context learning. We evaluate the performance of three advanced LLMs and two state-of-the-art machine learning models on a real traffic incident dataset. The results show that the best-performing LLM matches the accuracy of the most accurate machine learning model, despite the former not having been trained on this prediction task. The findings indicate that LLMs are a practically viable option for traffic incident impact prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at the 2025 IEEE 28th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC), Gold Coast, Australia, 2025.

In this paper, we explore how pre-trained execution plan embeddings can guide SQL query execution without the need for additional model training. We introduce LLM-PM (LLM-based Plan Mapping), a framework that embeds the default execution plan of a query, finds its k nearest neighbors among previously executed plans, and recommends database hintsets based on neighborhood voting. A lightweight consistency check validates the selected hint, while a fallback mechanism searches the full hint space when needed. Evaluated on the JOB-CEB benchmark using OpenGauss, LLM-PM achieves an average speed-up of 21% query latency reduction. This work highlights the potential of LLM-powered embeddings to deliver practical improvements in query performance and opens new directions for training-free, embedding-based optimizer guidance systems.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |

In this work, we investigate how language models memorize label noise, and why such memorization in many cases does not heavily affect generalizable reasoning capabilities. Using two controllable synthetic reasoning datasets with noisy labels, four-digit addition (FDA) and two-hop relational reasoning (THR), we discover a reliance of memorization on generalizable reasoning mechanisms: models continue to compute intermediate reasoning outputs even when retrieving memorized noisy labels, and intervening reasoning adversely affects memorization. We further show that memorization operates through distributed encoding, i.e., aggregating various inputs and intermediate results, rather than building a look-up mechanism from inputs to noisy labels. Moreover, our FDA case study reveals memorization occurs via outlier heuristics, where existing neuron activation patterns are slightly shifted to fit noisy labels. Together, our findings suggest that memorization of label noise in language models builds on, rather than overrides, the underlying reasoning mechanisms, shedding lights on the intriguing phenomenon of benign memorization.</p></details> | 21 pages, 14 figures |

However, systematic legal standards and reliable evaluation methods for AI art copyrights are lacking. Through comprehensive analysis of legal precedents, we establish three essential criteria for determining distinctive artistic style: stylistic consistency, creative uniqueness, and expressive accuracy. To address these challenges, we introduce ArtBulb, an interpretable and quantifiable framework for AI art copyright judgment that combines a novel style description-based multimodal clustering method with multimodal large language models (MLLMs). We also present AICD, the first benchmark dataset for AI art copyright annotated by artists and legal experts. Experimental results demonstrate that ArtBulb outperforms existing models in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Our work aims to bridge the gap between the legal and technological communities and bring greater attention to the societal issue of AI art copyrights.</p></details> |  |

Physics poses unique challenges that demand not only precise computation but also deep conceptual understanding and physical modeling skills. Existing benchmarks often fall short due to limited difficulty, multiple-choice formats, and static evaluation settings that fail to capture physical modeling ability. In this paper, we introduce ABench-Physics, a novel benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate LLMs' physical reasoning and generalization capabilities. ABench-Physics consists of two components: Phy_A, a static set of 400 graduate- or Olympiad-level problems; and Phy_B, a dynamic subset of 100 problems equipped with an automatic variation engine to test model robustness across changing conditions. All questions require precise numerical answers, with strict formatting and tolerance constraints. Our evaluation of several state-of-the-art LLMs reveals substantial performance gaps, highlighting persistent limitations in physical reasoning, especially in generalization to dynamic variants. ABench-Physics provides a challenging and diagnostic framework for advancing scientific reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models for Network Intrusion Detection Systems: Foundations, Implementations, and Future Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04752v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized various fields with their exceptional capabilities in understanding, processing, and generating human-like text. This paper investigates the potential of LLMs in advancing Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS), analyzing current challenges, methodologies, and future opportunities. It begins by establishing a foundational understanding of NIDS and LLMs, exploring the enabling technologies that bridge the gap between intelligent and cognitive systems in AI-driven NIDS. While Intelligent NIDS leverage machine learning and deep learning to detect threats based on learned patterns, they often lack contextual awareness and explainability. In contrast, Cognitive NIDS integrate LLMs to process both structured and unstructured security data, enabling deeper contextual reasoning, explainable decision-making, and automated response for intrusion behaviors. Practical implementations are then detailed, highlighting LLMs as processors, detectors, and explainers within a comprehensive AI-driven NIDS pipeline. Furthermore, the concept of an LLM-centered Controller is proposed, emphasizing its potential to coordinate intrusion detection workflows, optimizing tool collaboration and system performance. Finally, this paper identifies critical challenges and opportunities, aiming to foster innovation in developing reliable, adaptive, and explainable NIDS. By presenting the transformative potential of LLMs, this paper seeks to inspire advancement in next-generation network security systems.</p></details> |  |

This integration results in comprehensive summaries that capture both subjective opinions and objective product attributes essential for informed decision-making. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant success in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, their potential in M-OS remains largely unexplored. Additionally, the lack of evaluation datasets for this task has impeded further advancements. To bridge this gap, we introduce M-OS-EVAL, a benchmark dataset for evaluating multi-source opinion summaries across 7 key dimensions: fluency, coherence, relevance, faithfulness, aspect coverage, sentiment consistency, specificity. Our results demonstrate that M-OS significantly enhances user engagement, as evidenced by a user study in which, on average, 87% of participants preferred M-OS over opinion summaries. Our experiments demonstrate that factually enriched summaries enhance user engagement. Notably, M-OS-PROMPTS exhibit stronger alignment with human judgment, achieving an average Spearman correlation of \r{ho} = 0.74, which surpasses the performance of previous methodologies.</p></details> |  |

However, enabling accurate, real-time, and context-aware interactions with HVAC systems introduces unique challenges, including the integration of frequently updated sensor data, domain-specific knowledge grounding, and coherent multi-stage reasoning. In this paper, we present JARVIS, a two-stage LLM-based QA framework tailored for sensor data-driven HVAC system interaction. JARVIS employs an Expert-LLM to translate high-level user queries into structured execution instructions, and an Agent that performs SQL-based data retrieval, statistical processing, and final response generation. To address HVAC-specific challenges, JARVIS integrates (1) an adaptive context injection strategy for efficient HVAC and deployment-specific information integration, (2) a parameterized SQL builder and executor to improve data access reliability, and (3) a bottom-up planning scheme to ensure consistency across multi-stage response generation. We evaluate JARVIS using real-world data collected from a commercial HVAC system and a ground truth QA dataset curated by HVAC experts to demonstrate its effectiveness in delivering accurate and interpretable responses across diverse queries. Results show that JARVIS consistently outperforms baseline and ablation variants in both automated and user-centered assessments, achieving high response quality and accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Activation Steering for Chain-of-Thought Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04742v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning when they include intermediate steps, known as "chains of thought" (CoTs). However, these rationales are often overly verbose, even for simple problems, leading to wasted context, increased latency, and higher energy consumption. We observe that verbose, English-heavy CoTs and concise, math-centric CoTs occupy distinct regions in the model's residual-stream activation space. By extracting and injecting a "steering vector" to transition between these modes, we can reliably shift generation toward more concise reasoning, effectively compressing CoTs without retraining. We formalize this approach as Activation-Steered Compression (ASC), an inference-time technique that shortens reasoning traces by directly modifying hidden representations. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis of the impact of ASC on the output distribution, derived from a closed-form KL-divergence-bounded constraint to regulate steering strength. Using only 100 paired verbose and concise examples, ASC achieves up to 67.43% reduction in CoT length on MATH500 and GSM8K datasets, while maintaining accuracy across 7B, 8B, and 32B parameter models. As a training-free method, ASC introduces negligible runtime overhead and, on MATH500, delivers an average 2.73x speedup in end-to-end reasoning wall-clock time on an 8B model. This makes ASC a practical and efficient tool for streamlining the deployment of reasoning-capable LLMs in latency- or cost-sensitive settings.

However, current approaches face a critical challenge: they can not simultaneously optimize for functional correctness and hardware quality (Power, Performance, Area - PPA). Methods based on supervised fine-tuning often generate functionally correct but PPA-suboptimal code, lacking mechanisms to learn optimization principles. In contrast, post-processing techniques that attempt to improve PPA metrics after generation are often inefficient because they operate externally without updating the LLM's parameters, thus failing to enhance the model's intrinsic design capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce ChipSeek-R1, a hierarchical reward-driven reinforcement learning framework to train LLMs to generate RTL code that achieves both functional correctness and optimized PPA metrics. ChipSeek-R1 employs a hierarchical reward system, which incorporates direct feedback on syntax, functional correctness (from simulators) and PPA metrics (from synthesis tools) during reinforcement learning. This enables the model to learn complex hardware design trade-offs via trial-and-error, generating RTL code that is both functionally correct and PPA-optimized. Evaluating ChipSeek-R1 on standard benchmarks (VerilogEval, RTLLM), we achieve state-of-the-art results in functional correctness. Notably, on the RTLLM benchmark, ChipSeek-R1 generated 27 RTL designs surpassing the PPA metrics of the original human-written code. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating toolchain feedback into LLM training and highlight the potential for reinforcement learning to enable automated generation of human-surpassing RTL code. We open-source our code in anonymous github.</p></details> |  |

Although existing AIGI detection techniques are generally effective, they face two issues: 1) a lack of human-verifiable explanations, and 2) a lack of generalization in the latest generation technology. To address these issues, we introduce a large-scale and comprehensive dataset, Holmes-Set, which includes the Holmes-SFTSet, an instruction-tuning dataset with explanations on whether images are AI-generated, and the Holmes-DPOSet, a human-aligned preference dataset. Our work introduces an efficient data annotation method called the Multi-Expert Jury, enhancing data generation through structured MLLM explanations and quality control via cross-model evaluation, expert defect filtering, and human preference modification. In addition, we propose Holmes Pipeline, a meticulously designed three-stage training framework comprising visual expert pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and direct preference optimization. Holmes Pipeline adapts multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for AIGI detection while generating human-verifiable and human-aligned explanations, ultimately yielding our model AIGI-Holmes. During the inference stage, we introduce a collaborative decoding strategy that integrates the model perception of the visual expert with the semantic reasoning of MLLMs, further enhancing the generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our AIGI-Holmes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |

This paper investigates the use of Vision Language Models(VLMs) for zero-shot text-to-image retrieval on fabric samples. We address the lack of publicly available datasets by introducing an automated annotation pipeline that uses Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate two types of textual descriptions: freeform natural language and structured attribute-based descriptions. We produce these descriptions to evaluate retrieval performance across three Vision-Language Models: CLIP, LAION-CLIP, and Meta's Perception Encoder. Our experiments demonstrate that structured, attribute-rich descriptions significantly enhance retrieval accuracy, particularly for visually complex fabric classes, with the Perception Encoder outperforming other models due to its robust feature alignment capabilities. However, zero-shot retrieval remains challenging in this fine-grained domain, underscoring the need for domain-adapted approaches. Our findings highlight the importance of combining technical textual descriptions with advanced VLMs to optimize cross-modal retrieval in industrial applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Ital-IA 2025</p></details> |

We propose the novel task of generating Query-Focused Comparative Explainable Summaries (QF-CES) using Multi-Source Opinion Summarization (M-OS). To address the lack of query-focused recommendation datasets, we introduce MS-Q2P, comprising 7,500 queries mapped to 22,500 recommended products with metadata. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate tabular comparative summaries with query-specific explanations. Our approach is personalized, privacy-preserving, recommendation engine-agnostic, and category-agnostic. M-OS as an intermediate step reduces inference latency approximately by 40% compared to the direct input approach (DIA), which processes raw data directly. We evaluate open-source and proprietary LLMs for generating and assessing QF-CES. Extensive evaluations using QF-CES-PROMPT across 5 dimensions (clarity, faithfulness, informativeness, format adherence, and query relevance) showed an average Spearman correlation of 0.74 with human judgments, indicating its potential for QF-CES evaluation.</p></details> |  |

However, challenges persist in adapting these models for video comprehension due to the large volume of data and temporal complexity. Existing Video-LLMs using uniform frame sampling often struggle to capture the query-related crucial spatiotemporal clues of videos effectively. In this paper, we introduce Q-Frame, a novel approach for adaptive frame selection and multi-resolution scaling tailored to the video's content and the specific query. Q-Frame employs a training-free, plug-and-play strategy generated by a text-image matching network like CLIP, utilizing the Gumbel-Max trick for efficient frame selection. Q-Frame allows Video-LLMs to process more frames without exceeding computational limits, thereby preserving critical temporal and spatial information. We demonstrate Q-Frame's effectiveness through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including MLVU, LongVideoBench, and Video-MME, illustrating its superiority over existing methods and its applicability across various video understanding tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Modeling and Detecting Intention-Hiding Malicious Agents in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04724v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems powered by Large Language Models (LLM-MAS) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in collaborative problem-solving. While LLM-MAS exhibit strong collaborative abilities, the security risks in their communication and coordination remain underexplored. We bridge this gap by systematically investigating intention-hiding threats in LLM-MAS, and design four representative attack paradigms that subtly disrupt task completion while maintaining high concealment. These attacks are evaluated in centralized, decentralized, and layered communication structures. Experiments conducted on six benchmark datasets, including MMLU, MMLU-Pro, HumanEval, GSM8K, arithmetic, and biographies, demonstrate that they exhibit strong disruptive capabilities. To identify these threats, we propose a psychology-based detection framework AgentXposed, which combines the HEXACO personality model with the Reid Technique, using progressive questionnaire inquiries and behavior-based monitoring. Experiments conducted on six types of attacks show that our detection framework effectively identifies all types of malicious behaviors. The detection rate for our intention-hiding attacks is slightly lower than that of the two baselines, Incorrect Fact Injection and Dark Traits Injection, demonstrating the effectiveness of intention concealment. Our findings reveal the structural and behavioral risks posed by intention-hiding attacks and offer valuable insights into securing LLM-based multi-agent systems through psychological perspectives, which contributes to a deeper understanding of multi-agent safety. The code and data are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AgentXposed-F814.</p></details> |  |

To assess model's long-context performance, numerous long-context evaluation benchmarks have been proposed. However, variations in evaluation settings across these benchmarks lead to inconsistent results, making it difficult to draw reliable comparisons. Besides, the high computational cost of long-context evaluation poses a significant barrier for the community to conduct comprehensive assessments of long-context models. In this paper, we propose LOOM-Scope, a comprehensive and efficient framework for long-context evaluation. LOOM-Scope standardizes evaluation settings across diverse benchmarks, supports deployment of efficient long-context inference acceleration methods, and introduces a holistic yet lightweight benchmark suite to evaluate models comprehensively.

To meet this demand, various methods have been developed to synthesize data at scale. However, current methods for scaling up data generation often overlook a crucial aspect: the alignment between instructions and responses. We hypothesize that the quality of instruction-response pairs is determined not by the individual quality of each component, but by the degree of mutual alignment. To address this, we propose a Mutual Alignment Framework (MAIN) which enforces coherence between instructions and responses through mutual constraints. We demonstrate that MAIN generalizes well across model architectures and sizes, achieving state-of-the-art performance on LLaMA, Mistral, and Qwen models across diverse benchmarks. This work underscores the critical role of instruction-response alignment in enabling generalizable and high-quality instruction tuning for LLMs.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we propose a one-shot learning framework PVChat, the first personalized ViLLM that enables subject-aware question answering (QA) from a single video for each subject. Our approach optimizes a Mixture-of-Heads (MoH) enhanced ViLLM on a synthetically augmented video-QA dataset, leveraging a progressive image-to-video learning strategy. Specifically, we introduce an automated augmentation pipeline that synthesizes identity-preserving positive samples and retrieves hard negatives from existing video corpora, generating a diverse training dataset with four QA types: existence, appearance, action, and location inquiries. To enhance subject-specific learning, we propose a ReLU Routing MoH attention mechanism, alongside two novel objectives: (1) Smooth Proximity Regularization for progressive learning through exponential distance scaling and (2) Head Activation Enhancement for balanced attention routing. Finally, we adopt a two-stage training strategy, transitioning from image pre-training to video fine-tuning, enabling a gradual learning process from static attributes to dynamic representations. We evaluate PVChat on diverse datasets covering medical scenarios, TV series, anime, and real-world footage, demonstrating its superiority in personalized feature understanding after learning from a single video, compared to state-of-the-art ViLLMs.</p></details> |  |

Videos often have a larger volume of information and redundancy than texts or images. Models should present comprehensive understanding of the whole video to accurately retrieve query-relevant clips. We thus propose Tempo-R0: a Video Multimodal Large Language Model (Video-MLLM) for the temporal video grounding task via multimodal temporal sensing reinforcement. Specifically, during the preprocessing stage of our pipeline, we employ Self-adaptive Attention Allocation (SAA) method based on frame content variation to efficiently use the MLLM's limited attention. The Explicit Timestamp-modal Aligned (ETA) method is also utilized to strengthen our model's capability to perceive the boundaries of events in the video. In the fine-tuning part of our pipeline, we creatively apply Partial Irrelevance Refusing-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (PIR-GRPO) in TVG area to foster model's temporal reasoning from not only accepting relevant video-query pairs but also refusing irrelevant ones. Experiments demonstrate that our method accomplishes a notable advantage over SOTA solutions by around 3.5% on both the original QVHighlights testbench and its corrected version with more reasonable ground truth annotations.</p></details> |  |

To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel block-based diffusion approach that automatically generates counterfactual datasets without manual annotation. Our method utilizes large language models to identify entities and their spatial relationships. It then independently generates image blocks as "puzzle pieces" coherently arranged according to specified compositional rules. This process creates diverse, high-fidelity counterfactual image-text pairs with precisely controlled variations. In addition, we introduce a specialized loss function that differentiates inter-set from intra-set samples, enhancing training efficiency and reducing the need for negative samples. Experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning VLMs with our counterfactual datasets significantly improves visual reasoning performance. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks while using substantially less training data than existing methods.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we evaluate the capability of existing general LLMs for Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) code generation for CPUs. We use two LLMs provided by OpenAI: GPT-4.1, a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model, and o4-mini, one of the o-series of Reasoning models. Both have been released in April 2025. For the routines from level-1 to 3 BLAS, we tried to generate (1) C code without optimization from routine name only, (2) C code with basic performance optimizations (thread parallelization, SIMD vectorization, and cache blocking) from routine name only, and (3) C code with basic performance optimizations based on Fortran reference code. As a result, we found that correct code can be generated in many cases even when only routine name are given. We also confirmed that thread parallelization with OpenMP, SIMD vectorization, and cache blocking can be implemented to some extent, and that the code is faster than the reference code.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 tables |

Dataset discovery methods aim to automatically identify related data assets in a data lake. The development and evaluation of such solutions for customers from a wide range of business domains, relies on diverse, high quality and domain-specific tabular benchmarks. Large language models (LLMs) are trained on a wide variety of text data, which can provide a strong foundation of general and domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we ask the question -- \textit{can we leverage LLMs to generate a tabular benchmark adequate for evaluating the dataset discovery solutions?} In particular, we focus on the task of finding joinable tables which is the cornerstone of virtually every dataset discovery method. Current corpora for evaluating dataset discovery methods are mainly based on subsets of open data, and they suffer from three important issues: $i)$ they focus on very common and generic data types (e.g., address, id, name, etc.); $ii)$ they do not contain human-annotated column pairs; instead, practitioners synthesize ground truth using table splits (e.g., horizontal for table union search and vertical ones for joinability) and $iii)$ they do not focus on semantic column relationships.</p></details> | 13 pages |

Our analysis reveals that existing hallucination detection methods struggle with detailed captions. We attribute this to the increasing reliance of MLLMs on their generated text, rather than the input image, as the sequence length grows. To address this issue, we propose a multiagent approach that leverages LLM-MLLM collaboration to correct given captions. Additionally, we introduce an evaluation framework and a benchmark dataset to facilitate the systematic analysis of detailed captions. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed evaluation method better aligns with human judgments of factuality than existing metrics and that existing approaches to improve the MLLM factuality may fall short in hyper-detailed image captioning tasks. In contrast, our proposed method significantly enhances the factual accuracy of captions, even improving those generated by GPT-4V. Finally, we highlight a limitation of VQA-centric benchmarking by demonstrating that an MLLM's performance on VQA benchmarks may not correlate with its ability to generate detailed image captions.

We introduce Pensieve (https://www.pensieve.co), an AI-assisted grading platform that leverages large language models (LLMs) to transcribe and evaluate student work, providing instructors with rubric-aligned scores, transcriptions, and confidence ratings. Unlike prior tools that focus narrowly on specific tasks like transcription or rubric generation, Pensieve supports the entire grading pipeline-from scanned student submissions to final feedback-within a human-in-the-loop interface. Pensieve has been deployed in real-world courses at over 20 institutions and has graded more than 300,000 student responses. We present system details and empirical results across four core STEM disciplines: Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry.

Current state-of-the-art methods rely on complex multi-stage pipelines involving pixel segmentation, vectorization, and polygon refinement, which limits their scalability and real-world applicability. Inspired by the remarkable reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce VectorLLM, the first Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) designed for regular building contour extraction from remote sensing images. Unlike existing approaches, VectorLLM performs corner-point by corner-point regression of building contours directly, mimicking human annotators' labeling process. Our architecture consists of a vision foundation backbone, an MLP connector, and an LLM, enhanced with learnable position embeddings to improve spatial understanding capability. Through comprehensive exploration of training strategies including pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and preference optimization across WHU, WHU-Mix, and CrowdAI datasets, VectorLLM significantly outperformed the previous SOTA methods by 5.6 AP, 7.1 AP, 13.6 AP, respectively in the three datasets. Remarkably, VectorLLM exhibits strong zero-shot performance on unseen objects including aircraft, water bodies, and oil tanks, highlighting its potential for unified modeling of diverse remote sensing object contour extraction tasks. Overall, this work establishes a new paradigm for vector extraction in remote sensing, leveraging the topological reasoning capabilities of LLMs to achieve both high accuracy and exceptional generalization.

We introduce EKA-EVAL, a unified evaluation framework that integrates over 35+ benchmarks (including 10 Indic benchmarks) across nine major evaluation categories. The framework provides broader coverage than existing Indian language evaluation tools, offering 11 core capabilities through a modular architecture, seamless integration with Hugging Face and proprietary models, and plug-and-play usability. As the first end-to-end suite for scalable, multilingual LLM benchmarking, the framework combines extensive benchmarks, modular workflows, and dedicated support for low-resource Indian languages to enable inclusive assessment of LLM capabilities across diverse domains. We conducted extensive comparisons against five existing baselines, demonstrating that EKA-EVAL achieves the highest participant ratings in four out of five categories.

In this study, we seek to pinpoint the sources of this fragility by identifying parameters and input dimensions (pixels or token embeddings) that are susceptible to such perturbations. To this end, we propose a stability measure called \textbf{FI}, \textbf{F}irst order local \textbf{I}nfluence, which is rooted in information geometry and quantifies the sensitivity of individual parameter and input dimensions. Our extensive analysis across LLMs and VLMs (from 1.5B to 13B parameters) reveals that: (I) A small subset of parameters or input dimensions with high FI values disproportionately contribute to model brittleness. (II) Mitigating the influence of these vulnerable parameters during model merging leads to improved performance.</p></details> |  |

Advanced methods predominantly focus on language-centric tuning while less exploring multimodal tokens mixed through attention, posing challenges in high-level tasks that require fine-grained cognition and emotion understanding. In this work, we identify the attention deficit disorder problem in multimodal learning, caused by inconsistent cross-modal attention and layer-by-layer decayed attention activation. To address this, we propose a novel attention mechanism, termed MOdular Duplex Attention (MODA), simultaneously conducting the inner-modal refinement and inter-modal interaction. MODA employs a correct-after-align strategy to effectively decouple modality alignment from cross-layer token mixing. In the alignment phase, tokens are mapped to duplex modality spaces based on the basis vectors, enabling the interaction between visual and language modality. Further, the correctness of attention scores is ensured through adaptive masked attention, which enhances the model's flexibility by allowing customizable masking patterns for different modalities. Extensive experiments on 21 benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of MODA in perception, cognition, and emotion tasks.

The optimization process often requires numerous iterations to achieve satisfactory performance, resulting in high computational costs due to the need for frequent prompt evaluations under intensive LLM interactions and repeated policy updates. Appropriate online prompt selection methods reduce iteration steps by prioritizing informative prompts during training, while the pipeline's reliance on exhaustive prompt evaluation and subset selection for optimization still incurs substantial computational overhead due to frequent LLM inference calls. Distinguished from these direct evaluate-then-select schemes, this work investigates iterative approximate evaluation for arbitrary prompts and introduces Model Predictive Prompt Selection (MoPPS), a Bayesian risk-predictive framework that online estimates prompt difficulty without requiring costly LLM interactions. Technically, MoPPS models each prompt's success rate as a latent variable, performs streaming Bayesian inference, and employs posterior sampling in a constructed multi-armed bandit machine, enabling sample efficient and adaptive prompt selection. Extensive experiments across mathematics, planning, and vision-based geometry tasks show that MoPPS reliably predicts prompt difficulty and accelerates training with significantly reduced LLM rollouts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous User Modeling for LLM-based Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04626v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for recommendation has demonstrated notable success in various domains, showcasing their potential for open-domain recommendation. A key challenge to advancing open-domain recommendation lies in effectively modeling user preferences from users' heterogeneous behaviors across multiple domains. Existing approaches, including ID-based and semantic-based modeling, struggle with poor generalization, an inability to compress noisy interactions effectively, and the domain seesaw phenomenon. To address these challenges, we propose a Heterogeneous User Modeling (HUM) method, which incorporates a compression enhancer and a robustness enhancer for LLM-based recommendation. The compression enhancer uses a customized prompt to compress heterogeneous behaviors into a tailored token, while a masking mechanism enhances cross-domain knowledge extraction and understanding. The robustness enhancer introduces a domain importance score to mitigate the domain seesaw phenomenon by guiding domain optimization. Extensive experiments on heterogeneous datasets validate that HUM effectively models user heterogeneity by achieving both high efficacy and robustness, leading to superior performance in open-domain recommendation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by RecSys 2025</p></details> |

We first fully analyze this phenomenon on eight LLM-based embedders and show that this phenomenon is universal and is not affected by model architecture, training strategy, and embedding method. With a deeper analysis, we find that the main change in embedding space between these embedders and their LLM backbones is in the first principal component. By adjusting the first principal component, we can align text embedding with the key tokens. Finally, we give several examples to demonstrate the vast application potential of this finding: (1) we propose a simple and practical sparse retrieval method based on the aligned tokens, which can achieve 80% of the dense retrieval effect of the same model while reducing the computation significantly; (2) we show that our findings provide a novel perspective to help understand novel technologies (e.g., instruction-following embedding) and fuzzy concepts (e.g., semantic relatedness vs. similarity) in this field.</p></details> | ACL2025 Oral |

Existing SBR models often focus only on single-session information, ignoring inter-session relationships and valuable cross-session insights. Some methods try to include inter-session data but struggle with noise and irrelevant information, reducing performance. Additionally, most models rely on item ID co-occurrence and overlook rich semantic details, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained item features. To address these challenges, we propose a novel hierarchical intent-guided optimization approach with pluggable LLM-driven semantic learning for session-based recommendations, called HIPHOP. First, we introduce a pluggable embedding module based on large language models (LLMs) to generate high-quality semantic representations, enhancing item embeddings. Second, HIPHOP utilizes graph neural networks (GNNs) to model item transition relationships and incorporates a dynamic multi-intent capturing module to address users' diverse interests within a session. Additionally, we design a hierarchical inter-session similarity learning module, guided by user intent, to capture global and local session relationships, effectively exploring users' long-term and short-term interests. To mitigate noise, an intent-guided denoising strategy is applied during inter-session learning. Finally, we enhance the model's discriminative capability by using contrastive learning to optimize session representations. Experiments on multiple datasets show that HIPHOP significantly outperforms existing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving recommendation quality.

These applications demand high-dimensional multimodal data transmission and intelligent data processing in real-time, which is extremely challenging over resource-limited wireless communication systems. Moreover, a joint understanding of the environment, context, and user intent is essential to deliver task-relevant content effectively. This article presents a novel multimodal large language model (MLLM) integrated semantic communications framework, termed MLLM-SC, which fully leverages reasoning and generative capabilities of pre-trained foundation models for context-aware and task-oriented wireless communication. The MLLM-SC framework adopts a device-edge collaborative architecture. At the edge, MLLM-empowered semantic guidance module analyzes multimodal inputs, user intents, and channel conditions to generate importance-aware attention maps prioritizing semantically critical information. An importance-aware semantic encoder and a resource-adaptive semantic decoder are jointly designed and optimized, which can utilize the semantic guidance for adaptive bandwidth allocation and high-quality content reconstruction or generation. Extensive case studies on visual question answering for AR/VR applications and diffusion-driven image generation validate the effectiveness of MLLM-SC.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

We also experiment with any3 and any2 and show competitiveness at lower bits. Additionally, we show that we can calibrate using a single curated diverse sample rather than hundreds of samples from a dataset as done in most quantization approaches.

While recent efforts have implemented various personalization methods, a unified theoretical framework that can systematically understand the drivers of effective personalization is still lacking. In this work, we integrate the well-established cognitive dual-memory model into LLM personalization, by mirroring episodic memory to historical user engagements and semantic memory to long-term, evolving user beliefs. Specifically, we systematically investigate memory instantiations and introduce a unified framework, PRIME, using episodic and semantic memory mechanisms. We further augment PRIME with a novel personalized thinking capability inspired by the slow thinking strategy. Moreover, recognizing the absence of suitable benchmarks, we introduce a dataset using Change My View (CMV) from Reddit, specifically designed to evaluate long-context personalization. Extensive experiments validate PRIME's effectiveness across both long- and short-context scenarios. Further analysis confirms that PRIME effectively captures dynamic personalization beyond mere popularity biases.</p></details> |  |

This typically occurs because these models tend to prioritize self-generated content over the input context, causing them to disregard pertinent details. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel method called "Guided Attention Map Editing" (GAME), which dynamically adjusts attention maps to improve contextual relevance. During inference, GAME employs a trained classifier to identify attention maps prone to inducing hallucinations and executes targeted interventions. These interventions, guided by gradient-informed "edit directions'', strategically redistribute attention weights across various heads to effectively reduce hallucination. Comprehensive evaluations on challenging summarization and open-book QA tasks show that GAME consistently reduces hallucinations across a variety of open-source models. Specifically, GAME reduces hallucinations by 10% in the XSum summarization task while achieving a 7X speed-up in computational efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as Finding of NAACL 2025</p></details> |

Although Visual Language Models (VLMs) have excelled in high-level reasoning and long-horizon planning for robotic manipulation, they still fall short in grasping the nuanced physical properties required for effective human-robot interaction. In this paper, we introduce PAVLM (Point cloud Affordance Vision-Language Model), an innovative framework that utilizes the extensive multimodal knowledge embedded in pre-trained language models to enhance 3D affordance understanding of point cloud. PAVLM integrates a geometric-guided propagation module with hidden embeddings from large language models (LLMs) to enrich visual semantics. On the language side, we prompt Llama-3.1 models to generate refined context-aware text, augmenting the instructional input with deeper semantic cues. Experimental results on the 3D-AffordanceNet benchmark demonstrate that PAVLM outperforms baseline methods for both full and partial point clouds, particularly excelling in its generalization to novel open-world affordance tasks of 3D objects.

This paper examines the open-source paradigm's critical role in this transformation. While proprietary LLMs offer accessibility, they often limit the customization, interoperability, and transparency vital for specialized geospatial tasks. Conversely, open-source alternatives significantly advance Geographic Information Science (GIScience) by fostering greater adaptability, reproducibility, and community-driven innovation. Open frameworks empower researchers to tailor solutions, integrate cutting-edge methodologies (e.g., reinforcement learning, advanced spatial indexing), and align with FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles. However, the growing reliance on any LLM necessitates careful consideration of security vulnerabilities, ethical risks, and robust governance for AI-generated geospatial outputs. This paper argues that GIScience advances best not through a single model type, but by cultivating a diverse, interoperable ecosystem combining open-source foundations for innovation, custom geospatial models, and interdisciplinary collaboration. By critically evaluating the opportunities and challenges of open-source LLMs within the broader GeoAI landscape, this work contributes to a thorough discourse on leveraging LLMs to effectively advance spatial research, policy, and decision-making in an equitable, sustainable, and scientifically rigorous manner.</p></details> |  |

Existing defenses that aim to preserve context privacy during inference either lack formal guarantees or suffer from a poor utility/privacy trade-off. We propose DP-Fusion, a token-level Differentially Private Inference (DPI) mechanism that provably bounds how much an LLM's outputs reveal about sensitive tokens in its context. We demonstrate DPI through the task of document privatization, where the goal is to paraphrase documents so that sensitive content (e.g., Personally Identifiable Information, PII) cannot be reliably inferred, while still preserving the overall utility of the text. This is controlled by a parameter $\epsilon$: $\epsilon=0$ hides PII entirely, while higher values trade off privacy for improved paraphrase quality. DP-Fusion works as follows: (i) partition sensitive tokens into disjoint privacy groups, (ii) run the LLM once per group, and (iii) blend the output distributions so that the final output remains within a fixed statistical distance of the baseline distribution produced when no privacy group is revealed. This approach allows fine-grained control over the privacy/utility trade-off but requires multiple LLM forward passes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code and data are publicly available here: https://github.com/MBZUAI-Trustworthy-ML/DP-Fusion-DPI</p></details> |

Large Transformer models, including large language models (LLMs), often contain computational redundancy, which can serve as a target for new model compression methods. In this work, we specifically target neuron-level redundancies in model layers by combining groups of similar neurons into fewer neurons. We frame this width reduction as a Discrete Optimal Transport problem, and propose DOTResize, a novel Transformer compression method that uses optimal transport theory to transform and compress model weights. To ensure applicability within the Transformer architecture, we motivate and incorporate entropic regularization and matrix factorization into the transportation maps produced by our method. Unlike pruning-based approaches which discard neurons based on importance measures, DOTResize re-projects the entire neuron width, allowing the retention and redistribution of useful signal across the reduced layer. Empirical results show that compared to simple or state-of-the-art neuron width-pruning techniques, DOTResize can outperform these methods across multiple LLM families and sizes, while achieving measurable reductions in real-world computational cost.</p></details> |  |

However, existing research has overlooked the impact of hyperparameter choices, and also lacks a comprehensive evaluation of the out-of-domain table understanding ability and the general capabilities of these table LLMs. In this paper, we evaluate these abilities in existing table LLMs, and find significant declines in both out-of-domain table understanding and general capabilities as compared to their base models. Through systematic analysis, we show that hyperparameters, such as learning rate, can significantly influence both table-specific and general capabilities. Contrary to the previous table instruction-tuning work, we demonstrate that smaller learning rates and fewer training instances can enhance table understanding while preserving general capabilities. Based on our findings, we introduce TAMA, a TAble LLM instruction-tuned from LLaMA 3.1 8B Instruct, which achieves performance on par with, or surpassing GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on table tasks, while maintaining strong out-of-domain generalization and general capabilities.

However, such data may not be readily available in many applications, motivating zero-shot or few-shot approaches using domain-adjacent models. While several fine-tuned models for various tasks are available, finding an appropriate domain-adjacent model for a given task is often not straight forward. In this paper, we study DAFT-E, a framework that utilizes an Ensemble of Domain-Adjacent Fine-Tuned Foundation Models for few-shot problems. We show that for zero-shot problems, this ensembling method provides an accuracy performance close to that of the single best model. With few-shot problems, this performance improves further, at which point DEFT-E can outperform any single domain-adjacent model while requiring much less data for domain-specific fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main paper is 14 pages, followed by references and appendix</p></details> |
| **[Unveiling the Potential of Diffusion Large Language Model in Controllable Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04504v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models, originally developed for image generation, have emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive large language models (LLMs). We present a theoretical analysis comparing autoregressive and masked diffusion LLMs, revealing that the intrinsic bidirectional attention mechanism of diffusion LLMs (dLLMs) enables superior context modeling and generation controllability. However, existing dLLM applications face significant challenges in controllable generation: the native multi-step denoising process exhibits high sensitivity to sequence length, elevated hallucination rates, and prohibitive inference costs without specialized optimizations. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{S}elf-adaptive \textbf{S}chema \textbf{S}caffolding ($S^3$), a novel framework that enables dLLMs to generate structured outputs (e.g., JSON) while maintaining semantic fidelity and accelerating inference. Our approach injects the target schema structure into the output context, reducing unnecessary computation while improving controllability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $S^3$ achieves substantial improvements: 65\% increase in structural adherence, 48\% enhancement in content fidelity, and 17\% reduction in hallucination rates compared to baseline. These results establish both theoretical foundations and practical pathways for deploying diffusion models in controllable text generation tasks. Code and data will be publicly released.</p></details> |  |

The adaptation process assumes author familiarity with both the implementation of the example as well as how the new dataset might need to be transformed to fit into the example code. With recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), automatic adaptation of code can be achieved from high-level user prompts, reducing the barrier for visualization retargeting. To better understand how LLMs can assist retargeting and its potential limitations, we characterize and evaluate the performance of LLM assistance across multiple datasets and charts of varying complexity, categorizing failures according to type and severity. In our evaluation, we compare two approaches: (1) directly instructing the LLM model to fully generate and adapt code by treating code as text inputs and (2) a more constrained program synthesis pipeline where the LLM guides the code construction process by providing structural information (e.g., visual encodings) based on properties of the example code and data. We find that both approaches struggle when new data has not been appropriately transformed, and discuss important design recommendations for future retargeting systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

However, RAG's reliance on ingesting external documents introduces new vulnerabilities. This paper exposes a critical security gap at the data loading stage, where malicious actors can stealthily corrupt RAG pipelines by exploiting document ingestion. We propose a taxonomy of 9 knowledge-based poisoning attacks and introduce two novel threat vectors -- Content Obfuscation and Content Injection -- targeting common formats (DOCX, HTML, PDF). Using an automated toolkit implementing 19 stealthy injection techniques, we test five popular data loaders, finding a 74.4% attack success rate across 357 scenarios. We further validate these threats on six end-to-end RAG systems -- including white-box pipelines and black-box services like NotebookLM and OpenAI Assistants -- demonstrating high success rates and critical vulnerabilities that bypass filters and silently compromise output integrity. Our results emphasize the urgent need to secure the document ingestion process in RAG systems against covert content manipulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>curre...</summary><p>currently under submission</p></details> |

In this paper, we explore and assess the feasibility of using traditional binary string features for MFC in the new era of large language models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Specifically, we investigate how Family-Specific String (FSS) features could be utilized in a manner similar to RAG to facilitate MFC. To this end, we develop a curated evaluation framework covering 4,347 samples from 67 malware families, extract and analyze over 25 million strings, and conduct detailed ablation studies to assess the impact of different design choices in four major modules.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Query to Explanation: Uni-RAG for Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Learning in STEM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03868v1)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In AI-facilitated teaching, leveraging various query styles to interpret abstract educational content is crucial for delivering effective and accessible learning experiences. However, existing retrieval systems predominantly focus on natural text-image matching and lack the capacity to address the diversity and ambiguity inherent in real-world educational scenarios. To address this limitation, we develop a lightweight and efficient multi-modal retrieval module, named Uni-Retrieval, which extracts query-style prototypes and dynamically matches them with tokens from a continually updated Prompt Bank. This Prompt Bank encodes and stores domain-specific knowledge by leveraging a Mixture-of-Expert Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE-LoRA) module and can be adapted to enhance Uni-Retrieval's capability to accommodate unseen query types at test time. To enable natural language educational content generation, we integrate the original Uni-Retrieval with a compact instruction-tuned language model, forming a complete retrieval-augmented generation pipeline named Uni-RAG. Given a style-conditioned query, Uni-RAG first retrieves relevant educational materials and then generates human-readable explanations, feedback, or instructional content aligned with the learning objective. Experimental results on SER and other multi-modal benchmarks show that Uni-RAG outperforms baseline retrieval and RAG systems in both retrieval accuracy and generation quality, while maintaining low computational cost. Our framework provides a scalable, pedagogically grounded solution for intelligent educational systems, bridging retrieval and generation to support personalized, explainable, and efficient learning assistance across diverse STEM scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Fair RAG: On the Impact of Fair Ranking in Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11598v4)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the central role of retrieval in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, much of the existing research on RAG overlooks the well-established field of fair ranking and fails to account for the interests of all stakeholders involved. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic evaluation of RAG systems that integrate fairness-aware rankings, addressing both ranking fairness and attribution fairness, which ensures equitable exposure of the sources cited in the generated content. Our evaluation focuses on measuring item-side fairness, specifically the fair exposure of relevant items retrieved by RAG systems, and investigates how this fairness impacts both the effectiveness of the systems and the attribution of sources in the generated output that users ultimately see. By experimenting with twelve RAG models across seven distinct tasks, we show that incorporating fairness-aware retrieval often maintains or even enhances both ranking quality and generation quality, countering the common belief that fairness compromises system performance. Additionally, we demonstrate that fair retrieval practices lead to more balanced attribution in the final responses, ensuring that the generator fairly cites the sources it relies on. Our findings underscore the importance of item-side fairness in retrieval and generation, laying the foundation for responsible and equitable RAG systems and guiding future research in fair ranking and attribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICTIR...</summary><p>ICTIR 2025 (Oral); NeurIPS 2024 AFME Workshop (Spotlight)</p></details> |
| **[Benchmarking Vector, Graph and Hybrid Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipelines for Open Radio Access Networks (ORAN)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03608v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI (GenAI) is expected to play a pivotal role in enabling autonomous optimization in future wireless networks. Within the ORAN architecture, Large Language Models (LLMs) can be specialized to generate xApps and rApps by leveraging specifications and API definitions from the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) platform. However, fine-tuning base LLMs for telecom-specific tasks remains expensive and resource-intensive. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a practical alternative through in-context learning, enabling domain adaptation without full retraining. While traditional RAG systems rely on vector-based retrieval, emerging variants such as GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG incorporate knowledge graphs or dual retrieval strategies to support multi-hop reasoning and improve factual grounding. Despite their promise, these methods lack systematic, metric-driven evaluations, particularly in high-stakes domains such as ORAN. In this study, we conduct a comparative evaluation of Vector RAG, GraphRAG, and Hybrid GraphRAG using ORAN specifications. We assess performance across varying question complexities using established generation metrics: faithfulness, answer relevance, context relevance, and factual correctness. Results show that both GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG outperform traditional RAG. Hybrid GraphRAG improves factual correctness by 8%, while GraphRAG improves context relevance by 7%.</p></details> |  |

National protocols and WHO recommendations are typically extensive and complex, making it difficult to extract precise information, especially during urgent situations. This project tackles that issue by developing a multilingual, intelligent question-answering system that transforms static vaccination guidelines into an interactive and user-friendly knowledge base. Built on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework and enhanced with agent-based reasoning (Agentic RAG), the system provides accurate, context-sensitive answers to complex medical queries. Evaluation shows that Agentic RAG outperforms traditional methods, particularly in addressing multi-step or ambiguous questions. To support clinical use, the system is integrated into a mobile application designed for real-time, point-of-care access to essential vaccine information.

| **[Efficient Knowledge Graph Construction and Retrieval from Unstructured Text for Large-Scale RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03226v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a scalable and cost-efficient framework for deploying Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) in enterprise environments. While GraphRAG has shown promise for multi-hop reasoning and structured retrieval, its adoption has been limited by the high computational cost of constructing knowledge graphs using large language models (LLMs) and the latency of graph-based retrieval. To address these challenges, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a dependency-based knowledge graph construction pipeline that leverages industrial-grade NLP libraries to extract entities and relations from unstructured text completely eliminating reliance on LLMs; and (2) a lightweight graph retrieval strategy that combines hybrid query node identification with efficient one-hop traversal for high-recall, low-latency subgraph extraction. We evaluate our framework on two SAP datasets focused on legacy code migration and demonstrate strong empirical performance. Our system achieves up to 15% and 4.35% improvements over traditional RAG baselines based on LLM-as-Judge and RAGAS metrics, respectively. Moreover, our dependency-based construction approach attains 94% of the performance of LLM-generated knowledge graphs (61.87% vs. 65.83%) while significantly reducing cost and improving scalability. These results validate the feasibility of deploying GraphRAG systems in real-world, large-scale enterprise applications without incurring prohibitive resource requirements paving the way for practical, explainable, and domain-adaptable retrieval-augmented reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[CyberRAG: An agentic RAG cyber attack classification and reporting tool](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02424v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) in large enterprises can generate hundreds of thousands of alerts per hour, overwhelming security analysts with logs that demand deep, rapidly evolving domain expertise. Conventional machine-learning detectors trim the alert volume but still yield high false-positive rates, while standard single-pass Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines often retrieve irrelevant context and fail to justify their predictions. To overcome these shortcomings, we present CyberRAG, a modular, agent-based RAG framework that delivers real-time classification, explanation, and structured reporting for cyber-attacks. A central LLM agent orchestrates (i) a pool of fine-tuned specialized classifiers, each tailored to a distinct attack family; (ii) tool adapters for enrichment and alerting; and (iii) an iterative retrieval-and-reason loop that continuously queries a domain-specific knowledge base until the evidence is both relevant and self-consistent. Unlike traditional RAG systems, CyberRAG embraces an agentic design that enables dynamic control flow and adaptive reasoning. This agent-centric architecture refines its threat labels and natural-language justifications autonomously, reducing false positives and enhancing interpretability. The framework is fully extensible: new attack types can be supported by simply adding a classifier without retraining the core agent. CyberRAG has been evaluated achieving over 94% accuracy per class and pushing final classification accuracy to 94.92% through semantic orchestration. Generated explanations score up to 0.94 in BERTScore and 4.9/5 in GPT-4-based expert evaluation. These results show that agentic, specialist-oriented RAG can pair high detection accuracy with trustworthy, SOC-ready prose, offering a practical and scalable path toward semi-autonomous cyber-defence workflows.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a generative AI-powered GATE question-answering framework (GATE stands for Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering) that leverages LLMs to explain GATE solutions and support students in their exam preparation. We conducted extensive benchmarking to select the optimal embedding model and LLM, evaluating our framework based on criteria such as latency, faithfulness, and relevance, with additional validation through human evaluation. Our chatbot integrates state-of-the-art embedding models and LLMs to deliver accurate, context-aware responses. Through rigorous experimentation, we identified configurations that balance performance and computational efficiency, ensuring a reliable chatbot to serve students' needs. Additionally, we discuss the challenges faced in data processing and modeling and implemented solutions. Our work explores the application of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for GATE Q/A explanation tasks, and our findings demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and response quality. This research offers practical insights for developing effective AI-driven educational tools while highlighting areas for future enhancement in usability and scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>One o...</summary><p>One of the co-authors is having conflict in the submission to arXiv due to many edits (we have to make changes in evaluation strategies, i.e. section 5); in the paper there are still formatting issues</p></details> |

Existing vector search and RAG solutions largely assume abundant computation resources, making them impractical for on-device scenarios. In this paper, we propose MobileRAG, a fully on-device pipeline that overcomes these limitations by combining a mobile-friendly vector search algorithm, \textit{EcoVector}, with a lightweight \textit{Selective Content Reduction} (SCR) method. By partitioning and partially loading index data, EcoVector drastically reduces both memory footprint and CPU usage, while the SCR method filters out irrelevant text to diminish Language Model (LM) input size without degrading accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrated that MobileRAG significantly outperforms conventional vector search and RAG methods in terms of latency, memory usage, and power consumption, while maintaining accuracy and enabling offline operation to safeguard privacy in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | 14 pages |

However, complex tasks requiring multi-round retrieval remain challenging, and early attempts tend to be overly optimistic without a good sense of self-skepticism. Current multi-round RAG systems may continue searching even when enough information has already been retrieved, or they may provide incorrect answers without having sufficient information or knowledge. Existing solutions either require large amounts of expensive human-labeled process supervision data or lead to subpar performance. This paper aims to address these limitations by introducing a new framework, SIM-RAG, to explicitly enhance RAG systems' self-awareness and multi-round retrieval capabilities. To train SIM-RAG, we first let a RAG system self-practice multi-round retrieval, augmenting existing question-answer pairs with intermediate inner monologue reasoning steps to generate synthetic training data. For each pair, the system may explore multiple retrieval paths, which are labeled as successful if they reach the correct answer and unsuccessful otherwise. Using this data, we train a lightweight information sufficiency Critic. At inference time, the Critic evaluates whether the RAG system has retrieved sufficient information at each round, guiding retrieval decisions and improving system-level self-awareness through in-context reinforcement learning. Experiments across multiple prominent RAG benchmarks show that SIM-RAG is an effective multi-round RAG solution. Furthermore, this framework is system-efficient, adding a lightweight component to RAG without requiring modifications to existing LLMs or search engines, and data-efficient, eliminating the need for costly human-annotated mid-step retrieval process supervision data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 48th International ACM SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

While traditional flight control relies on hardcoded equations, recent Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential for more flexible problem-solving but struggle with reliably selecting and applying correct mathematical formulations and executing precise multi-step arithmetic. We propose RAG-UAV, a retrieval-augmented generation framework designed to improve the mathematical reasoning of several LLMs (including GPT o1/Turbo, Llama-3.2/3.3, Mistral, and DeepSeek R1) in UAV-specific contexts by providing access to relevant domain literature. To conduct an initial assessment, we introduce the UAV-Math-Bench, a 20-question problem set of UAV-centric mathematical problems across four difficulty levels. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating retrieval substantially increases exact answer accuracy (achieving up to 75% with o1), reduces instances of incorrect formulation selection (from 25% without RAG to 5\% with RAG), and decreases numerical errors, reducing Mean Squared Error (MSE) by orders of magnitude for the best-performing models. This pilot study indicates that RAG can enable general-purpose LLMs to function as more reliable tools for engineering analysis, although direct real-time flight control requires further investigation and validation on a larger scale. All benchmark data, questions, and answers are publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures, 4 appendix subsections</p></details> |

Recent advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods have explored enhancing models' search and reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL). Although these methods demonstrate promising results, they face challenges in training stability and encounter issues such as substantial inference time and restricted capabilities due to the single-query mode. In this paper, we propose RAG-R1, a novel training framework designed to enable LLMs to adaptively leverage internal and external knowledge during the reasoning process. We further expand the generation and retrieval processes within the framework from single-query mode to multi-query parallelism, aimed at reducing inference time and enhancing the model's capabilities. Extensive experiments on seven question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the strongest baseline by up to 13.2% and decreases inference time by 11.1%.</p></details> |  |

The context for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems in most benchmarks comes from Wikipedia-like texts written in a neutral and factual tone. However, real-world RAG applications often retrieve internet-based text with diverse tones and linguistic styles, posing challenges for downstream tasks. This paper introduces (a) a dataset that transforms RAG-retrieved passages into emotionally inflected and sarcastic text, (b) an emotion translation model for adapting text to different tones, and (c) a prompt-based method to improve LLMs' pragmatic interpretation of retrieved text.</p></details> |  |

To mitigate these, recent methodologies have integrated information retrieved from external resources with LLMs, substantially enhancing their performance across NLP tasks. This survey paper addresses the absence of a comprehensive overview on Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RALMs), both Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Retrieval-Augmented Understanding (RAU), providing an in-depth examination of their paradigm, evolution, taxonomy, and applications. The paper discusses the essential components of RALMs, including Retrievers, Language Models, and Augmentations, and how their interactions lead to diverse model structures and applications. RALMs demonstrate utility in a spectrum of tasks, from translation and dialogue systems to knowledge-intensive applications. The survey includes several evaluation methods of RALMs, emphasizing the importance of robustness, accuracy, and relevance in their assessment. It also acknowledges the limitations of RALMs, particularly in retrieval quality and computational efficiency, offering directions for future research. In conclusion, this survey aims to offer a structured insight into RALMs, their potential, and the avenues for their future development in NLP.

The system is built on a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework, which integrates a curated knowledge base to ensure factual consistency. To enhance retrieval effectiveness across diverse question types, we implement a hybrid search strategy that combines dense vector similarity with sparse keyword-based retrieval. This dual-retrieval mechanism improves robustness for both general and domain-specific queries. The system includes a feedback loop in which students can rate responses and instructors can review and revise them. Instructor corrections are incorporated into the retrieval corpus, enabling adaptive refinement over time. The system was deployed in a classroom setting as a substitute for traditional office hours, where it successfully addressed a broad range of student queries. It was also used to provide technical support by integrating with a customer-specific knowledge base, demonstrating its ability to handle routine, context-sensitive tasks in applied domains.

However, LLMs often fail to faithfully integrate retrieved evidence into their generated responses, leading to factual inconsistencies. To quantify this gap, we introduce Entity-Context Divergence (ECD), a metric that measures the extent to which retrieved information is accurately reflected in model outputs. We systematically evaluate contemporary LLMs on their ability to preserve factual consistency in retrieval-augmented settings, a capability we define as RAG-ability. Our empirical analysis reveals that RAG-ability remains low across most LLMs, highlighting significant challenges in entity retention and context fidelity. This paper introduces Radiant (Retrieval AugmenteD entIty-context AligNmenT), a novel framework that merges RAG with alignment designed to optimize the interplay between retrieved evidence and generated content. Radiant extends Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to teach LLMs how to integrate provided additional information into subsequent generations. As a behavior correction mechanism, Radiant boosts RAG performance across varied retrieval scenarios, such as noisy web contexts, knowledge conflicts, and hallucination reduction. This enables more reliable, contextually grounded, and factually coherent content generation.</p></details> |  |

This research presents a complex framework that leverages Data Science methodologies, notably Large Language Models (LLM) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, to improve the efficiency of analyzing Calcutta High Court verdicts. Our framework focuses on two key aspects: first, the creation of a robust summarization mechanism that distills complex legal texts into concise and coherent summaries; and second, the development of an intelligent system for retrieving similar cases, which will assist legal professionals in research and decision making. By fine-tuning the Pegasus model using case head note summaries, we achieve significant improvements in the summarization of legal cases. Our two-step summarizing technique preserves crucial legal contexts, allowing for the production of a comprehensive vector database for RAG. The RAG-powered framework efficiently retrieves similar cases in response to user queries, offering thorough overviews and summaries. This technique not only improves legal research efficiency, but it also helps legal professionals and students easily acquire and grasp key legal information, benefiting the overall legal scenario.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Knowledge Augmented Finetuning Matters in both RAG and Agent Based Dialog Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22852v1)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to dialog systems. Despite making progress, LLMs are prone to errors in knowledge-intensive scenarios. Recently, approaches based on retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and agent have emerged to improve the factual accuracy by enhancing the LLMs with knowledge retrieved from external knowledge bases (KBs). This is mostly implemented by prompting the LLMs with instructions, examples and the retrieved knowledge. However, LLMs may have difficulty using the retrieved knowledge effectively for response generation, because they are not well trained to do such generation for specific domains. To mitigate this problem, we propose to finetune the LLMs in the RAG-based and agent-based systems with domain-specific data, together with domain-specific external knowledge, which is called knowledge augmented finetuning (KAFT). We base our study on the MobileCS2 dataset, a real-life customer service dialog dataset that features intensive knowledge interactions, to systematically compare the prompting and KAFT techniques in the RAG-based and agent-based systems. Experiment results show that KAFT substantially surpasses prompting in both RAG and agent systems, particularly in terms of factual accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this paper represents the first solid empirical work to investigate the KAFT idea.</p></details> |  |

Answering questions over such content often requires joint reasoning across modalities, which strains traditional large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines due to token limitations, layout loss, and fragmented cross-modal context. We introduce MultiFinRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework purpose-built for financial QA. MultiFinRAG first performs multimodal extraction by grouping table and figure images into batches and sending them to a lightweight, quantized open-source multimodal LLM, which produces both structured JSON outputs and concise textual summaries. These outputs, along with narrative text, are embedded and indexed with modality-aware similarity thresholds for precise retrieval.

However, evaluating the multifaceted quality of RAG outputs, spanning aspects such as contextual coherence, query relevance, factual correctness, and informational completeness, poses significant challenges. Existing evaluation methods often rely on simple lexical overlap metrics, which are inadequate for capturing these nuances, or involve complex multi-stage pipelines with intermediate steps like claim extraction or require finetuning specialized judge models, hindering practical efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose CCRS (Contextual Coherence and Relevance Score), a novel suite of five metrics that utilizes a single, powerful, pretrained LLM as a zero-shot, end-to-end judge. CCRS evaluates: Contextual Coherence (CC), Question Relevance (QR), Information Density (ID), Answer Correctness (AC), and Information Recall (IR). We apply CCRS to evaluate six diverse RAG system configurations on the challenging BioASQ dataset. Our analysis demonstrates that CCRS effectively discriminates between system performances, confirming, for instance, that the Mistral-7B reader outperforms Llama variants. We provide a detailed analysis of CCRS metric properties, including score distributions, convergent/discriminant validity, tie rates, population statistics, and discriminative power. Compared to the complex RAGChecker framework, CCRS offers comparable or superior discriminative power for key aspects like recall and faithfulness, while being significantly more computationally efficient. CCRS thus provides a practical, comprehensive, and efficient framework for evaluating and iteratively improving RAG systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at LLM4Eval @ SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

While the effectiveness of the retrieval module is typically evaluated with relevance-based ranking metrics, such metrics may be insufficient to reflect the retrieval's impact on the final RAG result, especially in long-form generation scenarios. We argue that providing a comprehensive retrieval-augmented context is important for long-form RAG tasks like report generation and propose metrics for assessing the context independent of generation. We introduce CRUX, a \textbf{C}ontrolled \textbf{R}etrieval-a\textbf{U}gmented conte\textbf{X}t evaluation framework designed to directly assess retrieval-augmented contexts. This framework uses human-written summaries to control the information scope of knowledge, enabling us to measure how well the context covers information essential for long-form generation. CRUX uses question-based evaluation to assess RAG's retrieval in a fine-grained manner. Empirical results show that CRUX offers more reflective and diagnostic evaluation. Our findings also reveal substantial room for improvement in current retrieval methods, pointing to promising directions for advancing RAG's retrieval. Our data and code are publicly available to support and advance future research on retrieval.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, we propose Temporal Causal Probabilistic Description Logic (T-CPDL), an integrated framework that extends traditional Description Logic with temporal interval operators, explicit causal relationships, and probabilistic annotations. We present two distinct variants of T-CPDL: one capturing qualitative temporal relationships through Allen's interval algebra, and another variant enriched with explicit timestamped causal assertions. Both variants share a unified logical structure, enabling complex reasoning tasks ranging from simple temporal ordering to nuanced probabilistic causation. Empirical evaluations on temporal reasoning and causal inference benchmarks confirm that T-CPDL substantially improves inference accuracy, interpretability, and confidence calibration of language model outputs. By delivering transparent reasoning paths and fine-grained temporal and causal semantics, T-CPDL significantly enhances the capability of language models to support robust, explainable, and trustworthy decision-making. This work also lays the groundwork for developing advanced Logic-Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Logic-RAG) frameworks, potentially boosting the reasoning capabilities and efficiency of knowledge graph-enhanced RAG systems.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we introduce a modular AI system that leverages a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to automate standard applicability determination. Given a free-text device description, our system retrieves candidate standards from a curated corpus and uses large language models to infer jurisdiction-specific applicability, classified as Mandatory, Recommended, or Not Applicable, with traceable justifications. We construct an international benchmark dataset of medical device descriptions with expert-annotated standard mappings, and evaluate our system against retrieval-only, zero-shot, and rule-based baselines. The proposed approach attains a classification accuracy of 73% and a Top-5 retrieval recall of 87%, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying relevant regulatory standards. We introduce the first end-to-end system for standard applicability reasoning, enabling scalable and interpretable AI-supported regulatory science. Notably, our region-aware RAG agent performs cross-jurisdictional reasoning between Chinese and U.S. standards, supporting conflict resolution and applicability justification across regulatory frameworks.</p></details> |  |

We introduce PreQRAG, a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture designed to improve retrieval and generation quality through targeted question preprocessing. PreQRAG incorporates a pipeline that first classifies each input question as either single-document or multi-document type. For single-document questions, we employ question rewriting techniques to improve retrieval precision and generation relevance. For multi-document questions, we decompose complex queries into focused sub-questions that can be processed more effectively by downstream components. This classification and rewriting strategy improves the RAG performance.

While RAG systems aim to leverage such communications as a knowledge base, their effectiveness is limited by raw data challenges: support tickets are typically noisy, inconsistent, and incomplete, making direct retrieval suboptimal. Unlike existing RAG approaches that focus on runtime optimization, we introduce a novel offline-first methodology that transforms these communications into a structured knowledge base. Our key innovation is a LLMs-based multi-agent system orchestrating three specialized agents: Category Discovery for taxonomy creation, Categorization for ticket grouping, and Knowledge Synthesis for article generation. Applying our methodology to real-world support tickets with resolution notes and comments, our system creates a compact knowledge base - reducing total volume to just 3.4% of original ticket data while improving quality. Experiments demonstrate that our prebuilt knowledge base in RAG systems significantly outperforms traditional RAG implementations (48.74% vs. 38.60% helpful answers) and achieves a 77.4% reduction in unhelpful responses. By automating institutional knowledge capture that typically remains siloed in experts' heads, our solution translates to substantial operational efficiency: reducing support workload, accelerating resolution times, and creating self-improving systems that automatically resolve approximately 50% of future supply chain tickets. Our approach addresses a key gap in knowledge management by transforming transient communications into structured, reusable knowledge through intelligent offline processing rather than latency-inducing runtime architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted In Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on AI for Supply Chain: Today and Future @ 31st ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining V.2 (KDD 25), August 3, 2025, Toronto, ON, Canada.

However, they also exhibit inherent limitations, such as outdated knowledge and susceptibility to hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm to address these issues, but it also introduces new vulnerabilities. Recent efforts have focused on the security of RAG-based LLMs, yet existing attack methods face three critical challenges: (1) their effectiveness declines sharply when only a limited number of poisoned texts can be injected into the knowledge database, (2) they lack sufficient stealth, as the attacks are often detectable by anomaly detection systems, which compromises their effectiveness, and (3) they rely on heuristic approaches to generate poisoned texts, lacking formal optimization frameworks and theoretic guarantees, which limits their effectiveness and applicability. To address these issues, we propose coordinated Prompt-RAG attack (PR-attack), a novel optimization-driven attack that introduces a small number of poisoned texts into the knowledge database while embedding a backdoor trigger within the prompt. When activated, the trigger causes the LLM to generate pre-designed responses to targeted queries, while maintaining normal behavior in other contexts. This ensures both high effectiveness and stealth. We formulate the attack generation process as a bilevel optimization problem leveraging a principled optimization framework to develop optimal poisoned texts and triggers. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PR-Attack, achieving a high attack success rate even with a limited number of poisoned texts and significantly improved stealth compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

Given the challenges in continual learning with large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become the dominant way to introduce new information. However, its reliance on vector retrieval hinders its ability to mimic the dynamic and interconnected nature of human long-term memory. Recent RAG approaches augment vector embeddings with various structures like knowledge graphs to address some of these gaps, namely sense-making and associativity. However, their performance on more basic factual memory tasks drops considerably below standard RAG. We address this unintended deterioration and propose HippoRAG 2, a framework that outperforms standard RAG comprehensively on factual, sense-making, and associative memory tasks. HippoRAG 2 builds upon the Personalized PageRank algorithm used in HippoRAG and enhances it with deeper passage integration and more effective online use of an LLM. This combination pushes this RAG system closer to the effectiveness of human long-term memory, achieving a 7% improvement in associative memory tasks over the state-of-the-art embedding model while also exhibiting superior factual knowledge and sense-making memory capabilities. This work paves the way for non-parametric continual learning for LLMs. Code and data are available at https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/HippoRAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025.

However, numerous methodologies frequently neglect the calibration capabilities of large language models (LLMs), which capitalize on their robust in-context reasoning prowess. This work illustrates that providing LLMs with specific cues substantially improves their calibration efficacy, especially in multi-round calibrations. We present a new SGIC: Self-Guided Iterative Calibration Framework that employs uncertainty scores as a tool. Initially, this framework calculates uncertainty scores to determine both the relevance of each document to the query and the confidence level in the responses produced by the LLMs. Subsequently, it reevaluates these scores iteratively, amalgamating them with prior responses to refine calibration. Furthermore, we introduce an innovative approach for constructing an iterative self-calibration training set, which optimizes LLMs to efficiently harness uncertainty scores for capturing critical information and enhancing response accuracy. Our proposed framework significantly improves performance on both closed-source and open-weight LLMs.</p></details> |  |

We present a novel multimodal document chunking approach that leverages Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to process PDF documents in batches while maintaining semantic coherence and structural integrity. Our method processes documents in configurable page batches with cross-batch context preservation, enabling accurate handling of tables spanning multiple pages, embedded visual elements, and procedural content. We evaluate our approach on a curated dataset of PDF documents with manually crafted queries, demonstrating improvements in chunk quality and downstream RAG performance. Our vision-guided approach achieves better accuracy compared to traditional vanilla RAG systems, with qualitative analysis showing superior preservation of document structure and semantic coherence.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 1 Figure, 1 Table</p></details> |

Legal texts are characterized by a predefined hierarchical structure, an extensive network of references and a continuous evolution through multiple temporal versions. This temporal dynamism poses a significant challenge for standard AI systems, demanding a deterministic representation of the law at any given point in time. To address this, our approach grounds the knowledge graph construction in a formal, FRBRoo-inspired model that distinguishes abstract legal works from their concrete textual expressions. We introduce a multi-layered representation of Temporal Versions (capturing date-specific changes) and Language Versions (capturing linguistic variations). By modeling normative evolution as a precise sequence of these versioned entities, we enable the construction of a knowledge graph that serves as a verifiable "ground truth". This allows Large Language Models to generate responses based on accurate, context-aware, and point-in-time correct legal information, overcoming the risk of temporal inaccuracies. Through a detailed analysis of this formal Graph RAG approach and its application to legal norm datasets, this article aims to advance the field of Artificial Intelligence applied to Law, creating opportunities for more effective and reliable systems in legal research, legislative analysis, and decision support.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version enhances the theoretical underpinnings of the proposed Graph RAG methodology, including the introduction of a formal, FRBRoo-based model for versioning, and enabling multi-language support for both content and metadata</p></details> |

It shows that LLMs struggle to capture the root causes of vulnerabilities during vulnerability detection. To address this challenge, we propose enhancing LLMs with multi-dimensional vulnerability knowledge distilled from historical vulnerabilities and fixes. We design a novel knowledge-level Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework Vul-RAG, which improves LLMs with an accuracy increase of 16% - 24% in identifying vulnerable and patched code. Additionally, vulnerability knowledge generated by Vul-RAG can further (1) serve as high-quality explanations to improve manual detection accuracy (from 60% to 77%), and (2) detect 10 previously-unknown bugs in the recent Linux kernel release with 6 assigned CVEs.</p></details> |  |

When a user submits a query, RAG executes a vector search to find relevant documents, which are then used to generate a response. However, ensuring the relevance of retrieved documents with a query would be a big challenge. To address this, a secondary model, known as a relevant grader, can be served to verify its relevance. To reduce computational requirements of a relevant grader, a lightweight small language model is preferred. In this work, we finetuned llama-3.2-1b as a relevant grader and achieved a significant increase in precision from 0.1301 to 0.7750. Its precision is comparable to that of llama-3.1-70b.

While RDF/OWL reasoners enable graph-based reasoning, they are limited to fragments of first-order logic, preventing deeper temporal and semantic analysis. This paper addresses both challenges by developing automatic historical event extraction models using multiple LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Llama 3.2) with three enhancement strategies: pure base generation, knowledge graph enhancement, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). We conducted comprehensive evaluations using historical texts from Thucydides. Our findings reveal that enhancement strategies optimize different performance dimensions rather than providing universal improvements. For coverage and historical breadth, base generation achieves optimal performance with Claude and GPT-4 extracting comprehensive events. However, for precision, RAG enhancement improves coordinate accuracy and metadata completeness. Model architecture fundamentally determines enhancement sensitivity: larger models demonstrate robust baseline performance with incremental RAG improvements, while Llama 3.2 shows extreme variance from competitive performance to complete failure. We then developed an automated translation pipeline converting extracted RDF representations into Coq proof assistant specifications, enabling higher-order reasoning beyond RDF capabilities including multi-step causal verification, temporal arithmetic with BC dates, and formal proofs about historical causation. The Coq formalization validates that RAG-discovered event types represent legitimate domain-specific semantic structures rather than ontological violations.</p></details> |  |

Traditional RAG pipelines often suffer from high latency and limited accuracy over massive, diverse datasets. DoTA-RAG addresses these challenges with a three-stage pipeline: query rewriting, dynamic routing to specialized sub-indexes, and multi-stage retrieval and ranking. We further enhance retrieval by evaluating and selecting a superior embedding model, re-embedding the large FineWeb-10BT corpus. Moreover, we create a diverse Q&A dataset of 500 questions generated via the DataMorgana setup across a broad range of WebOrganizer topics and formats. DoTA-RAG improves the answer correctness score from 0.752 (baseline, using LiveRAG pre-built vector store) to 1.478 while maintaining low latency, and it achieves a 0.929 correctness score on the Live Challenge Day.

Current approaches to supporting research idea generation often rely on generic large language models (LLMs). While LLMs are effective at aiding comprehension and summarization, they often fall short in guiding users toward practical research ideas due to their limitations. In this study, we present a novel structural framework for research ideation. Our framework, The Budget AI Researcher, uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) chains, vector databases, and topic-guided pairing to recombine concepts from hundreds of machine learning papers. The system ingests papers from nine major AI conferences, which collectively span the vast subfields of machine learning, and organizes them into a hierarchical topic tree. It uses the tree to identify distant topic pairs, generate novel research abstracts, and refine them through iterative self-evaluation against relevant literature and peer reviews, generating and refining abstracts that are both grounded in real-world research and demonstrably interesting. Experiments using LLM-based metrics indicate that our method significantly improves the concreteness of generated research ideas relative to standard prompting approaches. Human evaluations further demonstrate a substantial enhancement in the perceived interestingness of the outputs. By bridging the gap between academic data and creative generation, the Budget AI Researcher offers a practical, free tool for accelerating scientific discovery and lowering the barrier for aspiring researchers. Beyond research ideation, this approach inspires solutions to the broader challenge of generating personalized, context-aware outputs grounded in evolving real-world knowledge.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inten...</summary><p>Intended for AAAI's AI4Research Workshop</p></details> |

Data augmentation can potentially alleviate the data shortage, but augmenting vulnerable code is challenging and requires a generative solution that maintains vulnerability. Previous works have only focused on generating samples that contain single statements or specific types of vulnerabilities. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to solve various code generation and comprehension tasks with inspiring results, especially when fused with retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Therefore, we propose VulScribeR, a novel LLM-based solution that leverages carefully curated prompt templates to augment vulnerable datasets. More specifically, we explore three strategies to augment both single and multi-statement vulnerabilities, with LLMs, namely Mutation, Injection, and Extension. Our extensive evaluation across four vulnerability datasets and DLVD models, using three LLMs, show that our approach beats two SOTA methods Vulgen and VGX, and Random Oversampling (ROS) by 27.48%, 27.93%, and 15.41% in f1-score with 5K generated vulnerable samples on average, and 53.84%, 54.10%, 69.90%, and 40.93% with 15K generated vulnerable samples.

However, RAG also introduces new security risks. Existing research focuses mainly on how poisoning attacks in RAG systems affect model output quality, overlooking their potential to amplify model biases. For example, when querying about domestic violence victims, a compromised RAG system might preferentially retrieve documents depicting women as victims, causing the model to generate outputs that perpetuate gender stereotypes even when the original query is gender neutral. To show the impact of the bias, this paper proposes a Bias Retrieval and Reward Attack (BRRA) framework, which systematically investigates attack pathways that amplify language model biases through a RAG system manipulation. We design an adversarial document generation method based on multi-objective reward functions, employ subspace projection techniques to manipulate retrieval results, and construct a cyclic feedback mechanism for continuous bias amplification. Experiments on multiple mainstream large language models demonstrate that BRRA attacks can significantly enhance model biases in dimensions. In addition, we explore a dual stage defense mechanism to effectively mitigate the impacts of the attack. This study reveals that poisoning attacks in RAG systems directly amplify model output biases and clarifies the relationship between RAG system security and model fairness. This novel potential attack indicates that we need to keep an eye on the fairness issues of the RAG system.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities to automate this translation. However, existing models still struggle with understanding domain-specific syntax and semantics. To enhance LLM performance in NL2SVA, we propose a customized retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework and a synthetic fine-tuning dataset that together improve LLM's performance. To further improve lightweight models over NL2SVA, our fine-tuning dataset provides prompt-guided explanations that teach LLMs the layer-by-layer construction process of concurrent SVAs, enabling supervised fine-tuning that greatly improves syntax and functionality accuracy. To evaluate the performance of LLMs over NL2SVA, we construct the largest evaluation dataset for NL2SVA, comprising 40 Verilog designs and 229 formally verified SVAs with detailed annotations. Experimental results show that our customized RAG framework increases the number of functionality matched SVAs by 58.42% over GPT-4o-mini, while Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct fine-tuned on our fine-tuning dataset and integrated with HybridRetrieval achieves a 59.05% over the base Qwen model.</p></details> |  |

This study evaluates the efficacy of two augmentation strategies--Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE)--on compact Gemma LLMs of 1 billion and 4 billion parameters, within the context of a privacy-first personal assistant. We implement short-term memory via MongoDB and long-term semantic storage via Qdrant, orchestrated through FastAPI and LangChain, and expose the system through a React.js frontend. Across both model scales, RAG consistently reduces latency by up to 17\% and eliminates factual hallucinations when responding to user-specific and domain-specific queries. HyDE, by contrast, enhances semantic relevance--particularly for complex physics prompts--but incurs a 25--40\% increase in response time and a non-negligible hallucination rate in personal-data retrieval. Comparing 1 B to 4 B models, we observe that scaling yields marginal throughput gains for baseline and RAG pipelines, but magnifies HyDE's computational overhead and variability. Our findings position RAG as the pragmatic choice for on-device personal assistants powered by small-scale LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report as part of research project</p></details> |

While early RAG systems based on static pipelines have shown effectiveness in well-structured tasks, they struggle in real-world scenarios requiring complex reasoning, dynamic retrieval, and multi-modal integration. To address these challenges, the field has shifted toward Reasoning Agentic RAG, a paradigm that embeds decision-making and adaptive tool use directly into the retrieval process. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of Reasoning Agentic RAG methods, categorizing them into two primary systems: predefined reasoning, which follows fixed modular pipelines to boost reasoning, and agentic reasoning, where the model autonomously orchestrates tool interaction during inference. We analyze representative techniques under both paradigms, covering architectural design, reasoning strategies, and tool coordination. Finally, we discuss key research challenges and propose future directions to advance the flexibility, robustness, and applicability of reasoning agentic RAG systems. Our collection of the relevant research has been organized into a https://github.com/ByebyeMonica/Reasoning-Agentic-RAG.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods typically rely on a single source, either unstructured text or structured knowledge. Moreover, they lack cognitively inspired mechanisms for activating relevant knowledge. To address these issues, we propose KG-Infused RAG, a framework that integrates KGs into RAG systems to implement spreading activation, a cognitive process that enables concept association and inference. KG-Infused RAG retrieves KG facts, expands the query accordingly, and enhances generation by combining corpus passages with structured facts, enabling interpretable, multi-source retrieval grounded in semantic structure. We further improve KG-Infused RAG via preference learning on sampled key stages in the pipeline. Experiments on five QA benchmarks show that KG-Infused RAG consistently outperforms vanilla RAG (by 3.8% to 13.8%). Additionally, when integrated into Self-RAG, KG-Infused RAG brings further performance gains, demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility as a plug-and-play enhancement module for corpus-based RAG methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[CiteFix: Enhancing RAG Accuracy Through Post-Processing Citation Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15629v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful application of Large Language Models (LLMs), revolutionizing information search and consumption. RAG systems combine traditional search capabilities with LLMs to generate comprehensive answers to user queries, ideally with accurate citations. However, in our experience of developing a RAG product, LLMs often struggle with source attribution, aligning with other industry studies reporting citation accuracy rates of only about 74% for popular generative search engines. To address this, we present efficient post-processing algorithms to improve citation accuracy in LLM-generated responses, with minimal impact on latency and cost. Our approaches cross-check generated citations against retrieved articles using methods including keyword + semantic matching, fine tuned model with BERTScore, and a lightweight LLM-based technique. Our experimental results demonstrate a relative improvement of 15.46% in the overall accuracy metrics of our RAG system. This significant enhancement potentially enables a shift from our current larger language model to a relatively smaller model that is approximately 12x more cost-effective and 3x faster in inference time, while maintaining comparable performance. This research contributes to enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of AI-generated content in information retrieval and summarization tasks which is critical to gain customer trust especially in commercial products.</p></details> |  |

Existing watermarking methods in RAG focus solely on textual knowledge, leaving image knowledge unprotected. In this work, we propose AQUA, the first watermark framework for image knowledge protection in Multimodal RAG systems. AQUA embeds semantic signals into synthetic images using two complementary methods: acronym-based triggers and spatial relationship cues. These techniques ensure watermark signals survive indirect watermark propagation from image retriever to textual generator, being efficient, effective and imperceptible. Experiments across diverse models and datasets show that AQUA enables robust, stealthy, and reliable copyright tracing, filling a key gap in multimodal RAG protection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why Uncertainty Estimation Methods Fall Short in RAG: An Axiomatic Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07459v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are valued for their strong performance across various tasks, but they also produce inaccurate or misleading outputs. Uncertainty Estimation (UE) quantifies the model's confidence and helps users assess response reliability. However, existing UE methods have not been thoroughly examined in scenarios like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), where the input prompt includes non-parametric knowledge. This paper shows that current UE methods cannot reliably assess correctness in the RAG setting. We further propose an axiomatic framework to identify deficiencies in existing methods and guide the development of improved approaches. Our framework introduces five constraints that an effective UE method should meet after incorporating retrieved documents into the LLM's prompt. Experimental results reveal that no existing UE method fully satisfies all the axioms, explaining their suboptimal performance in RAG. We further introduce a simple yet effective calibration function based on our framework, which not only satisfies more axioms than baseline methods but also improves the correlation between uncertainty estimates and correctness.</p></details> |  |

The information needs regarding datasets are implicitly embedded in particular research tasks, rather than explicitly expressed in search queries. However, existing scientific retrieval and question-answering (QA) datasets typically address straightforward questions, which do not align with the distribution of real-world research inquiries. To bridge this gap, we developed ScIRGen, a dataset generation framework for scientific QA \& retrieval that more accurately reflects the information needs of professional science researchers, and uses it to create a large-scale scientific retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) dataset with realistic queries, datasets and papers. Technically, we designed a dataset-oriented information extraction method that leverages academic papers to augment the dataset representation. We then proposed a question generation framework by employing cognitive taxonomy to ensure the quality of synthesized questions. We also design a method to automatically filter synthetic answers based on the perplexity shift of LLMs, which is highly aligned with human judgment of answers' validity. Collectively, these methodologies culminated in the creation of the 61k QA dataset, ScIRGen-Geo. We benchmarked representative methods on the ScIRGen-Geo dataset for their question-answering and retrieval capabilities, finding out that current methods still suffer from reasoning from complex questions. This work advances the development of more sophisticated tools to support the intricate information needs of the scientific community.</p></details> | KDD 2025 Accepted |

Our benchmark contains 2366 questions of diverse complexity, dynamism, and topics, and includes over 35K annotated passages retrieved from both private document sets and the Web, to reflect real-world RAG use cases. This makes it an ideal test bed to evaluate an LLM's ability to identify only the relevant information necessary to compose a response, or provide a deflective response when there is insufficient information. Evaluations of multiple state-of-the-art LLMs on GaRAGe show that the models tend to over-summarise rather than (a) ground their answers strictly on the annotated relevant passages (reaching at most a Relevance-Aware Factuality Score of 60%), or (b) deflect when no relevant grounding is available (reaching at most 31% true positive rate in deflections). The F1 in attribution to relevant sources is at most 58.9%, and we show that performance is particularly reduced when answering time-sensitive questions and when having to draw knowledge from sparser private grounding sources.</p></details> | ACL 2025 (Findings) |

However, existing RAG approaches predominantly rely on flat, similarity-based retrieval that fails to leverage the rich relational structure inherent in user-item interactions. We introduce LlamaRec-LKG-RAG, a novel single-pass, end-to-end trainable framework that integrates personalized knowledge graph context into LLM-based recommendation ranking. Our approach extends the LlamaRec architecture by incorporating a lightweight user preference module that dynamically identifies salient relation paths within a heterogeneous knowledge graph constructed from user behavior and item metadata. These personalized subgraphs are seamlessly integrated into prompts for a fine-tuned Llama-2 model, enabling efficient and interpretable recommendations through a unified inference step. Comprehensive experiments on ML-100K and Amazon Beauty datasets demonstrate consistent and significant improvements over LlamaRec across key ranking metrics (MRR, NDCG, Recall). LlamaRec-LKG-RAG demonstrates the critical value of structured reasoning in LLM-based recommendations and establishes a foundation for scalable, knowledge-aware personalization in next-generation recommender systems.

| **[MrM: Black-Box Membership Inference Attacks against Multimodal RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07399v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems enhance large vision-language models by integrating cross-modal knowledge, enabling their increasing adoption across real-world multimodal tasks. These knowledge databases may contain sensitive information that requires privacy protection. However, multimodal RAG systems inherently grant external users indirect access to such data, making them potentially vulnerable to privacy attacks, particularly membership inference attacks (MIAs). % Existing MIA methods targeting RAG systems predominantly focus on the textual modality, while the visual modality remains relatively underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose MrM, the first black-box MIA framework targeted at multimodal RAG systems. It utilizes a multi-object data perturbation framework constrained by counterfactual attacks, which can concurrently induce the RAG systems to retrieve the target data and generate information that leaks the membership information. Our method first employs an object-aware data perturbation method to constrain the perturbation to key semantics and ensure successful retrieval. Building on this, we design a counterfact-informed mask selection strategy to prioritize the most informative masked regions, aiming to eliminate the interference of model self-knowledge and amplify attack efficacy. Finally, we perform statistical membership inference by modeling query trials to extract features that reflect the reconstruction of masked semantics from response patterns. Experiments on two visual datasets and eight mainstream commercial visual-language models (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2) demonstrate that MrM achieves consistently strong performance across both sample-level and set-level evaluations, and remains robust under adaptive defenses.</p></details> |  |
| **[BRIGHT+: Upgrading the BRIGHT Benchmark with MARCUS, a Multi-Agent RAG Clean-Up Suite](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07116v1)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems require corpora that are both structurally clean and semantically coherent. BRIGHT is a recent and influential benchmark designed to evaluate complex multi-hop retrieval across diverse, high-reasoning domains. However, its practical effectiveness is limited by common web-crawled artifacts - such as content redundancy and semantic discontinuity - that impair retrieval accuracy and downstream reasoning. Notably, we find that such issues are concentrated in seven StackExchange-derived subdomains, while other domains (e.g., Coding and Theorem-based content) remain relatively clean. In this study, we present MARCUS, a multi-agent pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to systematically clean and re-chunk BRIGHT into a higher-quality corpus: BRIGHT-Plus. MARCUS applies dedicated agents for structural noise removal and semantic segmentation, preserving answer-bearing spans while improving contextual integrity. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that BRIGHT-Plus yields consistent and significant improvements in both retrieval accuracy and multi-hop reasoning across a diverse set of retrievers. We release both the BRIGHT-Plus corpus and the MARCUS pipeline to support future research on robust, reasoning-centric retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables.

| **[Graph-based RAG Enhancement via Global Query Disambiguation and Dependency-Aware Reranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11106v1)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contemporary graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods typically begin by extracting entities from user queries and then leverage pre-constructed knowledge graphs to retrieve related relationships and metadata. However, this pipeline's exclusive reliance on entity-level extraction can lead to the misinterpretation or omission of latent yet critical information and relations. As a result, retrieved content may be irrelevant or contradictory, and essential knowledge may be excluded, exacerbating hallucination risks and degrading the fidelity of generated responses. To address these limitations, we introduce PankRAG, a framework that combines a globally aware, hierarchical query-resolution strategy with a novel dependency-aware reranking mechanism. PankRAG first constructs a multi-level resolution path that captures both parallel and sequential interdependencies within a query, guiding large language models (LLMs) through structured reasoning. It then applies its dependency-aware reranker to exploit the dependency structure among resolved sub-questions, enriching and validating retrieval results for subsequent sub-questions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that PankRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across multiple benchmarks, underscoring its robustness and generalizability.</p></details> |  |

However, they often suffer from inefficiency and rely on manually pre-defined query modes, limiting practical use. In this paper, we propose E^2GraphRAG, a streamlined graph-based RAG framework that improves both Efficiency and Effectiveness. During the indexing stage, E^2GraphRAG constructs a summary tree with large language models and an entity graph with SpaCy based on document chunks. We then construct bidirectional indexes between entities and chunks to capture their many-to-many relationships, enabling fast lookup during both local and global retrieval. For the retrieval stage, we design an adaptive retrieval strategy that leverages the graph structure to retrieve and select between local and global modes. Experiments show that E^2GraphRAG achieves up to 10 times faster indexing than GraphRAG and 100 times speedup over LightRAG in retrieval while maintaining competitive QA performance.</p></details> | 16 pages |

Many existing educational solutions rely on cloud-based infrastructure or proprietary tools, which are costly and may raise privacy concerns. Regulated industries with limited budgets require affordable, self-hosted solutions. We introduce an end-to-end, open-source framework leveraging small (3B-7B parameters), locally deployed LLMs for customized teaching material generation and assessment. Our system uniquely incorporates an interactive loop crucial for effective small-model refinement, and an auxiliary LLM verifier to mitigate jailbreaking risks, enhancing output reliability and safety. Utilizing Retrieval and Context Augmented Generation (RAG/CAG), it produces factually accurate, customized pedagogically-styled content. Deployed on-premises for data privacy and validated through an evaluation pipeline and a college physics pilot, our findings show that carefully engineered small LLM systems can offer robust, affordable, practical, and safe educator support, achieving utility comparable to larger models for targeted tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[ECoRAG: Evidentiality-guided Compression for Long Context RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05167v2)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in Open-Domain Question Answering (ODQA) by leveraging external documents through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To reduce RAG overhead, from longer context, context compression is necessary. However, prior compression methods do not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, which limit the performance in LLM-based RAG. We thus propose Evidentiality-guided RAG, or ECoRAG framework. ECoRAG improves LLM performance by compressing retrieved documents based on evidentiality, ensuring whether answer generation is supported by the correct evidence. As an additional step, ECoRAG reflects whether the compressed content provides sufficient evidence, and if not, retrieves more until sufficient. Experiments show that ECoRAG improves LLM performance on ODQA tasks, outperforming existing compression methods. Furthermore, ECoRAG is highly cost-efficient, as it not only reduces latency but also minimizes token usage by retaining only the necessary information to generate the correct answer. Code is available at https://github.com/ldilab/ECoRAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAGE: A Framework of Precise Retrieval for RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01713v3)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated significant proficiency in conducting question-answering (QA) tasks within a specified corpus. Nonetheless, numerous failure instances of RAG in QA still exist. These failures are not solely attributable to the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs); instead, they predominantly arise from the retrieval of inaccurate information for LLMs due to two limitations: (1) Current RAG methods segment the corpus without considering semantics, making it difficult to find relevant context due to impaired correlation between questions and the segments. (2) There is a trade-off between missing essential context with fewer context retrieved and getting irrelevant context with more context retrieved. In this paper, we introduce a RAG framework (SAGE), to overcome these limitations. First, to address the segmentation issue without considering semantics, we propose to train a semantic segmentation model. This model is trained to segment the corpus into semantically complete chunks. Second, to ensure that only the most relevant chunks are retrieved while the irrelevant ones are ignored, we design a chunk selection algorithm to dynamically select chunks based on the decreasing speed of the relevance score, leading to a more relevant selection. Third, to further ensure the precision of the retrieved chunks, we propose letting LLMs assess whether retrieved chunks are excessive or lacking and then adjust the amount of context accordingly. Experiments show that SAGE outperforms baselines by 61.25% in the quality of QA on average. Moreover, by avoiding retrieving noisy context, SAGE lowers the cost of the tokens consumed in LLM inference and achieves a 49.41% enhancement in cost efficiency on average. Additionally, our work offers valuable insights for boosting RAG.</p></details> |  |

Within financial sectors, modern enterprises increasingly rely on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to address complex compliance requirements in financial document workflows. However, existing solutions struggle to account for the inherent heterogeneity of data (e.g., text, tables, diagrams) and evolving nature of regulatory standards used in financial filings, leading to compromised accuracy in critical information extraction. We propose the FinSage framework as a solution, utilizing a multi-aspect RAG framework tailored for regulatory compliance analysis in multi-modal financial documents. FinSage introduces three innovative components: (1) a multi-modal pre-processing pipeline that unifies diverse data formats and generates chunk-level metadata summaries, (2) a multi-path sparse-dense retrieval system augmented with query expansion (HyDE) and metadata-aware semantic search, and (3) a domain-specialized re-ranking module fine-tuned via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to prioritize compliance-critical content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FinSage achieves an impressive recall of 92.51% on 75 expert-curated questions derived from surpasses the best baseline method on the FinanceBench question answering datasets by 24.06% in accuracy. Moreover, FinSage has been successfully deployed as financial question-answering agent in online meetings, where it has already served more than 1,200 people.</p></details> |  |

It leverages graphs to model the hierarchical structure between specific concepts, enabling more coherent and effective knowledge retrieval for accurate reasoning.Despite its conceptual promise, recent studies report that GraphRAG frequently underperforms vanilla RAG on many real-world tasks. This raises a critical question: Is GraphRAG really effective, and in which scenarios do graph structures provide measurable benefits for RAG systems? To address this, we propose GraphRAG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate GraphRAG models onboth hierarchical knowledge retrieval and deep contextual reasoning. GraphRAG-Bench features a comprehensive dataset with tasks of increasing difficulty, coveringfact retrieval, complex reasoning, contextual summarization, and creative generation, and a systematic evaluation across the entire pipeline, from graph constructionand knowledge retrieval to final generation. Leveraging this novel benchmark, we systematically investigate the conditions when GraphRAG surpasses traditional RAG and the underlying reasons for its success, offering guidelines for its practical application.

| **[Multi-Head RAG: Solving Multi-Aspect Problems with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05085v3)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling the retrieval of documents into the LLM context to provide more accurate and relevant responses. Existing RAG solutions do not focus on queries that may require fetching multiple documents with substantially different contents. Such queries occur frequently, but are challenging because the embeddings of these documents may be distant in the embedding space, making it hard to retrieve them all. This paper introduces Multi-Head RAG (MRAG), a novel scheme designed to address this gap with a simple yet powerful idea: leveraging activations of Transformer's multi-head attention layer, instead of the decoder layer, as keys for fetching multi-aspect documents. The driving observation is that different attention heads learn to capture different data aspects. Harnessing the corresponding activations results in embeddings that represent various facets of data items and queries, improving the retrieval accuracy for complex queries. We provide an evaluation methodology and metrics, multi-aspect datasets, and real-world use cases to demonstrate MRAG's effectiveness. We show MRAG's design advantages over 18 RAG baselines, empirical improvements of up to 20% in retrieval success ratios, and benefits for downstream LLM generation. MRAG can be seamlessly integrated with existing RAG frameworks and benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, RAG systems are highly sensitive to retrieval noise prevalent in real-world scenarios. Existing benchmarks fail to emulate the complex and heterogeneous noise distributions encountered in real-world retrieval environments, undermining reliable robustness assessment. In this paper, we define four categories of retrieval noise based on linguistic properties and noise characteristics, aiming to reflect the heterogeneity of noise in real-world scenarios. Building on this, we introduce Magic Mushroom, a benchmark for replicating "magic mushroom" noise: contexts that appear relevant on the surface but covertly mislead RAG systems. Magic Mushroom comprises 7,468 single-hop and 3,925 multi-hop question-answer pairs. More importantly, Magic Mushroom enables researchers to flexibly configure combinations of retrieval noise according to specific research objectives or application scenarios, allowing for highly controlled evaluation setups. We evaluate LLM generators of varying parameter scales and classic RAG denoising strategies under diverse noise distributions to investigate their performance dynamics during progressive noise encroachment. Our analysis reveals that both generators and denoising strategies have significant room for improvement and exhibit extreme sensitivity to noise distributions. Magic Mushroom emerges as a promising tool for evaluating and advancing noise-robust RAG systems, accelerating their widespread deployment in real-world applications.

Semantic variability across domains like medicine, networking, or law hampers RAG's context precision, while fine-tuning solutions are costly, slow, and lack generalization as new data emerges. Achieving zero-shot precision with retrievers without fine-tuning still remains a key challenge. We introduce 'MetaGen Blended RAG', a novel enterprise search approach that enhances semantic retrievers through a metadata generation pipeline and hybrid query indexes using dense and sparse vectors. By leveraging key concepts, topics, and acronyms, our method creates metadata-enriched semantic indexes and boosted hybrid queries, delivering robust, scalable performance without fine-tuning. On the biomedical PubMedQA dataset, MetaGen Blended RAG achieves 82% retrieval accuracy and 77% RAG accuracy, surpassing all prior zero-shot RAG benchmarks and even rivaling fine-tuned models on that dataset, while also excelling on datasets like SQuAD and NQ. This approach redefines enterprise search using a new approach to building semantic retrievers with unmatched generalization across specialized domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

We show that existing attacks are not designed to be stealthy, allowing reliable detection and mitigation. We formalize stealth using a distinguishability-based security game. If a few poisoned passages are designed to control the response, they must differentiate themselves from benign ones, inherently compromising stealth. This motivates the need for attackers to rigorously analyze intermediate signals involved in generation$\unicode{x2014}$such as attention patterns or next-token probability distributions$\unicode{x2014}$to avoid easily detectable traces of manipulation. Leveraging attention patterns, we propose a passage-level score$\unicode{x2014}$the Normalized Passage Attention Score$\unicode{x2014}$used by our Attention-Variance Filter algorithm to identify and filter potentially poisoned passages. This method mitigates existing attacks, improving accuracy by up to $\sim 20 \%$ over baseline defenses. To probe the limits of attention-based defenses, we craft stealthier adaptive attacks that obscure such traces, achieving up to $35 \%$ attack success rate, and highlight the challenges in improving stealth.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we propose Cross-source knowledge \textbf{Re}conciliation for Multimodal RAG (CoRe-MMRAG), a novel end-to-end framework that effectively reconciles inconsistencies across knowledge sources. CoRe-MMRAG follows a four-stage pipeline: it first generates an internal response from parametric knowledge, then selects the most relevant multimodal evidence via joint similarity assessment, generates an external response, and finally integrates both to produce a reliable answer. Additionally, a specialized training paradigm enhances knowledge source discrimination, multimodal integration, and unified answer generation. Experiments on KB-VQA benchmarks show that CoRe-MMRAG achieves substantial improvements over baseline methods, achieving 5.6% and 9.3% performance gains on InfoSeek and Encyclopedic-VQA, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 Main</p></details> |

| **[IndicRAGSuite: Large-Scale Datasets and a Benchmark for Indian Language RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01615v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enable language models to access relevant information and generate accurate, well-grounded, and contextually informed responses. However, for Indian languages, the development of high-quality RAG systems is hindered by the lack of two critical resources: (1) evaluation benchmarks for retrieval and generation tasks, and (2) large-scale training datasets for multilingual retrieval. Most existing benchmarks and datasets are centered around English or high-resource languages, making it difficult to extend RAG capabilities to the diverse linguistic landscape of India. To address the lack of evaluation benchmarks, we create IndicMSMarco, a multilingual benchmark for evaluating retrieval quality and response generation in 13 Indian languages, created via manual translation of 1000 diverse queries from MS MARCO-dev set. To address the need for training data, we build a large-scale dataset of (question, answer, relevant passage) tuples derived from the Wikipedias of 19 Indian languages using state-of-the-art LLMs. Additionally, we include translated versions of the original MS MARCO dataset to further enrich the training data and ensure alignment with real-world information-seeking tasks.

| **[KET-RAG: A Cost-Efficient Multi-Granular Indexing Framework for Graph-RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09304v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-RAG constructs a knowledge graph from text chunks to improve retrieval in Large Language Model (LLM)-based question answering. It is particularly useful in domains such as biomedicine, law, and political science, where retrieval often requires multi-hop reasoning over proprietary documents. Some existing Graph-RAG systems construct KNN graphs based on text chunk relevance, but this coarse-grained approach fails to capture entity relationships within texts, leading to sub-par retrieval and generation quality. To address this, recent solutions leverage LLMs to extract entities and relationships from text chunks, constructing triplet-based knowledge graphs. However, this approach incurs significant indexing costs, especially for large document collections. To ensure a good result accuracy while reducing the indexing cost, we propose KET-RAG, a multi-granular indexing framework. KET-RAG first identifies a small set of key text chunks and leverages an LLM to construct a knowledge graph skeleton. It then builds a text-keyword bipartite graph from all text chunks, serving as a lightweight alternative to a full knowledge graph. During retrieval, KET-RAG searches both structures: it follows the local search strategy of existing Graph-RAG systems on the skeleton while mimicking this search on the bipartite graph to improve retrieval quality. We evaluate 13 solutions on three real-world datasets, demonstrating that KET-RAG outperforms all competitors in indexing cost, retrieval effectiveness, and generation quality. Notably, it achieves comparable or superior retrieval quality to Microsoft's Graph-RAG while reducing indexing costs by over an order of magnitude. Additionally, it improves the generation quality by up to 32.4% while lowering indexing costs by around 20%.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAG4ITOps: A Supervised Fine-Tunable and Comprehensive RAG Framework for IT Operations and Maintenance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15805v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the ever-increasing demands on Question Answering (QA) systems for IT operations and maintenance, an efficient and supervised fine-tunable framework is necessary to ensure the data security, private deployment and continuous upgrading. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have notably improved the open-domain QA's performance, how to efficiently handle enterprise-exclusive corpora and build domain-specific QA systems are still less-studied for industrial applications. In this paper, we propose a general and comprehensive framework based on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and facilitate the whole business process of establishing QA systems for IT operations and maintenance. In accordance with the prevailing RAG method, our proposed framework, named with RAG4ITOps, composes of two major stages: (1) Models Fine-tuning \& Data Vectorization, and (2) Online QA System Process. At the Stage 1, we leverage a contrastive learning method with two negative sampling strategies to fine-tune the embedding model, and design the instruction templates to fine-tune the LLM with a Retrieval Augmented Fine-Tuning method. At the Stage 2, an efficient process of QA system is built for serving. We collect enterprise-exclusive corpora from the domain of cloud computing, and the extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior results than counterparts on two kinds of QA tasks. Our experiment also provide a case for applying the RAG4ITOps to real-world enterprise-level applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2024 Industry Track</p></details> |

We demonstrate that enhancing generative models' capacity to process noisy content is equally critical for robust performance. In this paper, we present KARE-RAG (Knowledge-Aware Refinement and Enhancement for RAG), which improves knowledge utilization through three key innovations: (1) structured knowledge representations that facilitate error detection during training, (2) Dense Direct Preference Optimization (DDPO)-a refined training objective that prioritizes correction of critical errors, and (3) a contrastive data generation pipeline that maintains semantic consistency while rectifying factual inaccuracies. Experiments show our method significantly enhances standard RAG pipelines across model scales, improving both in-domain and out-of-domain task performance without compromising general capabilities. Notably, these gains are achieved with modest training data, suggesting data-efficient optimization is possible through targeted learning strategies. Our findings establish a new direction for RAG improvement: by improving how models learn to process retrieved content, we can enhance performance across diverse inference paradigms. All data and code will be publicly available on Github.</p></details> |  |
| **[VRAG-RL: Empower Vision-Perception-Based RAG for Visually Rich Information Understanding via Iterative Reasoning with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22019v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effectively retrieving, reasoning and understanding visually rich information remains a challenge for RAG methods. Traditional text-based methods cannot handle visual-related information. On the other hand, current vision-based RAG approaches are often limited by fixed pipelines and frequently struggle to reason effectively due to the insufficient activation of the fundamental capabilities of models. As RL has been proven to be beneficial for model reasoning, we introduce VRAG-RL, a novel RL framework tailored for complex reasoning across visually rich information. With this framework, VLMs interact with search engines, autonomously sampling single-turn or multi-turn reasoning trajectories with the help of visual perception tokens and undergoing continual optimization based on these samples. Our approach highlights key limitations of RL in RAG domains: (i) Prior Multi-modal RAG approaches tend to merely incorporate images into the context, leading to insufficient reasoning token allocation and neglecting visual-specific perception; and (ii) When models interact with search engines, their queries often fail to retrieve relevant information due to the inability to articulate requirements, thereby leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we define an action space tailored for visually rich inputs, with actions including cropping and scaling, allowing the model to gather information from a coarse-to-fine perspective. Furthermore, to bridge the gap between users' original inquiries and the retriever, we employ a simple yet effective reward that integrates query rewriting and retrieval performance with a model-based reward. Our VRAG-RL optimizes VLMs for RAG tasks using specially designed RL strategies, aligning the model with real-world applications. The code is available at https://github.com/Alibaba-NLP/VRAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ranking Free RAG: Replacing Re-ranking with Selection in RAG for Sensitive Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16014v3)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines rely on similarity-based retrieval and re-ranking, which depend on heuristics such as top-k, and lack explainability, interpretability, and robustness against adversarial content. To address this gap, we propose a novel method METEORA that replaces re-ranking in RAG with a rationale-driven selection approach. METEORA operates in two stages. First, a general-purpose LLM is preference-tuned to generate rationales conditioned on the input query using direct preference optimization. These rationales guide the evidence chunk selection engine, which selects relevant chunks in three stages: pairing individual rationales with corresponding retrieved chunks for local relevance, global selection with elbow detection for adaptive cutoff, and context expansion via neighboring chunks. This process eliminates the need for top-k heuristics. The rationales are also used for consistency check using a Verifier LLM to detect and filter poisoned or misleading content for safe generation. The framework provides explainable and interpretable evidence flow by using rationales consistently across both selection and verification. Our evaluation across six datasets spanning legal, financial, and academic research domains shows that METEORA improves generation accuracy by 33.34% while using approximately 50% fewer chunks than state-of-the-art re-ranking methods. In adversarial settings, METEORA significantly improves the F1 score from 0.10 to 0.44 over the state-of-the-art perplexity-based defense baseline, demonstrating strong resilience to poisoning attacks.

However, large-scale RAG systems consume significant computational resources and are prone to generating hallucinated content from Humans. In this work, we introduce $\texttt{DRAG}$, a novel framework for distilling RAG knowledge from large-scale Language Models (LLMs) into small LMs (SLMs). Our approach leverages evidence- and knowledge graph-based distillation, ensuring that the distilled model retains critical factual knowledge while significantly reducing model size and computational cost. By aligning the smaller model's predictions with a structured knowledge graph and ranked evidence, $\texttt{DRAG}$ effectively mitigates hallucinations and improves factual accuracy. We further present a case demonstrating how our framework mitigates user privacy risks and introduce a corresponding benchmark. Experimental evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the prior competitive RAG methods like MiniRAG for SLMs by up to 27.7% using the same models, preserving high-level efficiency and reliability. With $\texttt{DRAG}$, we provide a practical and resource-efficient roadmap to deploying enhanced retrieval and generation capabilities in small-sized LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 Main.

However, discrepancies between these textbooks and the parametric knowledge inherent in Large Language Models (LLMs) can undermine the effectiveness of RAG systems. To systematically investigate RAG system robustness against such knowledge discrepancies, we introduce KnowShiftQA. This novel question answering dataset simulates these discrepancies by applying deliberate hypothetical knowledge updates to both answers and source documents, reflecting how textbook knowledge can shift. KnowShiftQA comprises 3,005 questions across five subjects, designed with a comprehensive question typology focusing on context utilization and knowledge integration. Our extensive experiments on retrieval and question answering performance reveal that most RAG systems suffer a substantial performance drop when faced with these knowledge discrepancies. Furthermore, questions requiring the integration of contextual (textbook) knowledge with parametric (LLM) knowledge pose a significant challenge to current LLMs.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Main |

A key challenge is designing AI methods that can incrementally extract, structure, and validate information while preserving hierarchical and contextual relationships. We introduce CDMizer, a template-driven, LLM, and RAG-based framework for structured text transformation. By leveraging depth-based retrieval and hierarchical generation, CDMizer ensures a controlled, modular process that aligns generated outputs with predefined schema. Its template-driven approach guarantees syntactic correctness, schema adherence, and improved scalability, addressing key limitations of direct generation methods. Additionally, we propose an LLM-powered evaluation framework to assess the completeness and accuracy of structured representations. Demonstrated in the transformation of Over-the-Counter (OTC) financial derivative contracts into the Common Domain Model (CDM), CDMizer establishes a scalable foundation for AI-driven document understanding, structured synthesis, and automated validation in broader contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

This paper presents an automated platform designed to streamline key aspects of LEED certification. The platform integrates a PySide6-based user interface, a review Manager for process orchestration, and multiple analysis engines for credit compliance, energy modeling via EnergyPlus, and location-based evaluation.

| **[Investigating Language Preference of Multilingual RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11175v4)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) systems enhance language models by integrating external multilingual information to produce context-aware responses. However, mRAG systems struggle with retrieving relevant information due to linguistic variations between queries and documents, generating inconsistent responses when multilingual sources conflict. In this work, we systematically investigate language preferences in both retrieval and generation of mRAG through a series of experiments. Our analysis indicates that retrievers tend to prefer high-resource and query languages, yet this preference does not consistently improve generation performance. Moreover, we observe that generators prefer the query language or Latin scripts, leading to inconsistent outputs. To overcome these issues, we propose Dual Knowledge Multilingual RAG (DKM-RAG), a simple yet effective framework that fuses translated multilingual passages with complementary model knowledge. Empirical results demonstrate that DKM-RAG mitigates language preference in generation and enhances performance across diverse linguistic settings.

While several studies have investigated RAG pipelines for high-resource languages, the optimization of RAG components for Arabic remains underexplored. This study presents a comprehensive empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art RAG components-including chunking strategies, embedding models, rerankers, and language models-across a diverse set of Arabic datasets. Using the RAGAS framework, we systematically compare performance across four core metrics: context precision, context recall, answer faithfulness, and answer relevancy. Our experiments demonstrate that sentence-aware chunking outperforms all other segmentation methods, while BGE-M3 and Multilingual-E5-large emerge as the most effective embedding models. The inclusion of a reranker (bge-reranker-v2-m3) significantly boosts faithfulness in complex datasets, and Aya-8B surpasses StableLM in generation quality. These findings provide critical insights for building high-quality Arabic RAG pipelines and offer practical guidelines for selecting optimal components across different document types.</p></details> |  |
| **[ORAN-GUIDE: RAG-Driven Prompt Learning for LLM-Augmented Reinforcement Learning in O-RAN Network Slicing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00576v1)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced wireless networks must support highly dynamic and heterogeneous service demands. Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture enables this flexibility by adopting modular, disaggregated components, such as the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC), Centralized Unit (CU), and Distributed Unit (DU), that can support intelligent control via machine learning (ML). While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a powerful tool for managing dynamic resource allocation and slicing, it often struggles to process raw, unstructured input like RF features, QoS metrics, and traffic trends. These limitations hinder policy generalization and decision efficiency in partially observable and evolving environments. To address this, we propose \textit{ORAN-GUIDE}, a dual-LLM framework that enhances multi-agent RL (MARL) with task-relevant, semantically enriched state representations. The architecture employs a domain-specific language model, ORANSight, pretrained on O-RAN control and configuration data, to generate structured, context-aware prompts. These prompts are fused with learnable tokens and passed to a frozen GPT-based encoder that outputs high-level semantic representations for DRL agents. This design adopts a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) style pipeline tailored for technical decision-making in wireless systems. Experimental results show that ORAN-GUIDE improves sample efficiency, policy convergence, and performance generalization over standard MARL and single-LLM baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pandora's Box or Aladdin's Lamp: A Comprehensive Analysis Revealing the Role of RAG Noise in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13533v4)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a crucial method for addressing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). While recent research has extended RAG models to complex noisy scenarios, these explorations often confine themselves to limited noise types and presuppose that noise is inherently detrimental to LLMs, potentially deviating from real-world retrieval environments and restricting practical applicability. In this paper, we define seven distinct noise types from a linguistic perspective and establish a Noise RAG Benchmark (NoiserBench), a comprehensive evaluation framework encompassing multiple datasets and reasoning tasks. Through empirical evaluation of eight representative LLMs with diverse architectures and scales, we reveal that these noises can be further categorized into two practical groups: noise that is beneficial to LLMs (aka beneficial noise) and noise that is harmful to LLMs (aka harmful noise). While harmful noise generally impairs performance, beneficial noise may enhance several aspects of model capabilities and overall performance. Our analysis offers insights for developing more robust, adaptable RAG solutions and mitigating hallucinations across diverse retrieval scenarios.

| **[Astute RAG: Overcoming Imperfect Retrieval Augmentation and Knowledge Conflicts for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07176v2)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval augmented generation (RAG), while effectively integrating external knowledge to address the inherent limitations of large language models (LLMs), can be hindered by imperfect retrieval that contain irrelevant, misleading, or even malicious information. Previous studies have rarely connected the behavior of RAG through joint analysis, particularly regarding error propagation coming from imperfect retrieval and potential conflicts between LLMs' internal knowledge and external sources. Through comprehensive and controlled analyses under realistic conditions, we find that imperfect retrieval augmentation is inevitable, common, and harmful. We identify the knowledge conflicts between LLM-internal and external knowledge from retrieval as a bottleneck to overcome imperfect retrieval in the post-retrieval stage of RAG. To address this, we propose Astute RAG, a novel RAG approach designed to be resilient to imperfect retrieval augmentation. It adaptively elicits essential information from LLMs' internal knowledge, iteratively consolidates internal and external knowledge with source-awareness, and finalizes the answer according to information reliability. Our experiments with Gemini and Claude demonstrate the superior performance of Astute RAG compared to previous robustness-enhanced RAG approaches. Specifically, Astute RAG is the only RAG method that achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing conventional use of LLMs under the worst-case scenario. Further analysis reveals the effectiveness of Astute RAG in resolving knowledge conflicts, thereby improving the trustworthiness of RAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 main conference</p></details> |
| **[ComposeRAG: A Modular and Composable RAG for Corpus-Grounded Multi-Hop Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00232v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are increasingly diverse, yet many suffer from monolithic designs that tightly couple core functions like query reformulation, retrieval, reasoning, and verification. This limits their interpretability, systematic evaluation, and targeted improvement, especially for complex multi-hop question answering. We introduce ComposeRAG, a novel modular abstraction that decomposes RAG pipelines into atomic, composable modules. Each module, such as Question Decomposition, Query Rewriting, Retrieval Decision, and Answer Verification, acts as a parameterized transformation on structured inputs/outputs, allowing independent implementation, upgrade, and analysis. To enhance robustness against errors in multi-step reasoning, ComposeRAG incorporates a self-reflection mechanism that iteratively revisits and refines earlier steps upon verification failure. Evaluated on four challenging multi-hop QA benchmarks, ComposeRAG consistently outperforms strong baselines in both accuracy and grounding fidelity. Specifically, it achieves up to a 15% accuracy improvement over fine-tuning-based methods and up to a 5% gain over reasoning-specialized pipelines under identical retrieval conditions. Crucially, ComposeRAG significantly enhances grounding: its verification-first design reduces ungrounded answers by over 10% in low-quality retrieval settings, and by approximately 3% even with strong corpora. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the modular architecture, demonstrating distinct and additive contributions from each component. These findings underscore ComposeRAG's capacity to deliver flexible, transparent, scalable, and high-performing multi-hop reasoning with improved grounding and interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[REIC: RAG-Enhanced Intent Classification at Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00210v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate intent classification is critical for efficient routing in customer service, ensuring customers are connected with the most suitable agents while reducing handling times and operational costs. However, as companies expand their product lines, intent classification faces scalability challenges due to the increasing number of intents and variations in taxonomy across different verticals. In this paper, we introduce REIC, a Retrieval-augmented generation Enhanced Intent Classification approach, which addresses these challenges effectively. REIC leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to dynamically incorporate relevant knowledge, enabling precise classification without the need for frequent retraining. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that REIC outperforms traditional fine-tuning, zero-shot, and few-shot methods in large-scale customer service settings. Our results highlight its effectiveness in both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, demonstrating its potential for real-world deployment in adaptive and large-scale intent classification systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[The RAG Paradox: A Black-Box Attack Exploiting Unintentional Vulnerabilities in Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20995v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing adoption of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, various attack methods have been proposed to degrade their performance. However, most existing approaches rely on unrealistic assumptions in which external attackers have access to internal components such as the retriever. To address this issue, we introduce a realistic black-box attack based on the RAG paradox, a structural vulnerability arising from the system's effort to enhance trust by revealing both the retrieved documents and their sources to users. This transparency enables attackers to observe which sources are used and how information is phrased, allowing them to craft poisoned documents that are more likely to be retrieved and upload them to the identified sources. Moreover, as RAG systems directly provide retrieved content to users, these documents must not only be retrievable but also appear natural and credible to maintain user confidence in the search results. Unlike prior work that focuses solely on improving document retrievability, our attack method explicitly considers both retrievability and user trust in the retrieved content. Both offline and online experiments demonstrate that our method significantly degrades system performance without internal access, while generating natural-looking poisoned documents.</p></details> |  |

A robust benchmark dataset must satisfy three key criteria: quality, diversity, and difficulty, which capturing the complexity of reasoning based on hops and the distribution of supporting evidence. In this paper, we propose MHTS (Multi-Hop Tree Structure), a novel dataset synthesis framework that systematically controls multi-hop reasoning complexity by leveraging a multi-hop tree structure to generate logically connected, multi-chunk queries. Our fine-grained difficulty estimation formula exhibits a strong correlation with the overall performance metrics of a RAG system, validating its effectiveness in assessing both retrieval and answer generation capabilities. By ensuring high-quality, diverse, and difficulty-controlled queries, our approach enhances RAG evaluation and benchmarking capabilities.</p></details> |  |

However, despite their widespread use, popular datasets such as WebQSP and CWQ suffer from critical quality issues, including inaccurate or incomplete ground-truth annotations, poorly constructed questions that are ambiguous, trivial, or unanswerable, and outdated or inconsistent knowledge. Through a manual audit of 16 popular KGQA datasets, including WebQSP and CWQ, we find that the average factual correctness rate is only 57 %. To address these issues, we introduce KGQAGen, an LLM-in-the-loop framework that systematically resolves these pitfalls. KGQAGen combines structured knowledge grounding, LLM-guided generation, and symbolic verification to produce challenging and verifiable QA instances. Using KGQAGen, we construct KGQAGen-10k, a ten-thousand scale benchmark grounded in Wikidata, and evaluate a diverse set of KG-RAG models. Experimental results demonstrate that even state-of-the-art systems struggle on this benchmark, highlighting its ability to expose limitations of existing models. Our findings advocate for more rigorous benchmark construction and position KGQAGen as a scalable framework for advancing KGQA evaluation.</p></details> | 9 pages |

Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods attempt to address this by retrieving globally relevant images, but they fail when no single image contains all desired elements from a complex user query. We propose Cross-modal RAG, a novel framework that decomposes both queries and images into sub-dimensional components, enabling subquery-aware retrieval and generation. Our method introduces a hybrid retrieval strategy - combining a sub-dimensional sparse retriever with a dense retriever - to identify a Pareto-optimal set of images, each contributing complementary aspects of the query. During generation, a multimodal large language model is guided to selectively condition on relevant visual features aligned to specific subqueries, ensuring subquery-aware image synthesis. Extensive experiments on MS-COCO, Flickr30K, WikiArt, CUB, and ImageNet-LT demonstrate that Cross-modal RAG significantly outperforms existing baselines in both retrieval and generation quality, while maintaining high efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[DocReRank: Single-Page Hard Negative Query Generation for Training Multi-Modal RAG Rerankers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22584v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rerankers play a critical role in multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by refining ranking of an initial set of retrieved documents. Rerankers are typically trained using hard negative mining, whose goal is to select pages for each query which rank high, but are actually irrelevant. However, this selection process is typically passive and restricted to what the retriever can find in the available corpus, leading to several inherent limitations. These include: limited diversity, negative examples which are often not hard enough, low controllability, and frequent false negatives which harm training. Our paper proposes an alternative approach: Single-Page Hard Negative Query Generation, which goes the other way around. Instead of retrieving negative pages per query, we generate hard negative queries per page. Using an automated LLM-VLM pipeline, and given a page and its positive query, we create hard negatives by rephrasing the query to be as similar as possible in form and context, yet not answerable from the page. This paradigm enables fine-grained control over the generated queries, resulting in diverse, hard, and targeted negatives. It also supports efficient false negative verification. Our experiments show that rerankers trained with data generated using our approach outperform existing models and significantly improve retrieval performance.</p></details> |  |

However, current LLM-based evaluation frameworks predominantly rely on directly prompting resource-intensive models with complex multi-stage prompts, underutilizing models' reasoning capabilities and introducing significant computational cost. In this paper, we present RAG-Zeval (RAG-Zero Evaluator), a novel end-to-end framework that formulates faithfulness and correctness evaluation as a rule-guided reasoning task. Our approach trains evaluators with reinforcement learning, facilitating compact models to generate comprehensive and sound assessments with detailed explanation in one-pass. We introduce a ranking-based outcome reward mechanism, using preference judgments rather than absolute scores, to address the challenge of obtaining precise pointwise reward signals. To this end, we synthesize the ranking references by generating quality-controlled responses with zero human annotation. Experiments demonstrate RAG-Zeval's superior performance, achieving the strongest correlation with human judgments and outperforming baselines that rely on LLMs with 10-100 times more parameters. Our approach also exhibits superior interpretability in response evaluation.</p></details> |  |

However, existing VLM often generate inaccurate answers due to a lack of up-to-date knowledge. To address this issue, recent research has introduced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, commonly used in Large Language Models (LLM), into VLM, incorporating external multi-modal knowledge to enhance the accuracy and practicality of VLM systems. Nevertheless, the RAG in LLM may be susceptible to data poisoning attacks. RAG-based VLM may also face the threat of this attack. This paper first reveals the vulnerabilities of the RAG-based large model under poisoning attack, showing that existing single-modal RAG poisoning attacks have a 100\% failure rate in multi-modal RAG scenarios. To address this gap, we propose Spa-VLM (Stealthy Poisoning Attack on RAG-based VLM), a new paradigm for poisoning attacks on large models. We carefully craft malicious multi-modal knowledge entries, including adversarial images and misleading text, which are then injected into the RAG's knowledge base. When users access the VLM service, the system may generate misleading outputs. We evaluate Spa-VLM on two Wikipedia datasets and across two different RAGs. Results demonstrate that our method achieves highly stealthy poisoning, with the attack success rate exceeding 0.8 after injecting just 5 malicious entries into knowledge bases with 100K and 2M entries, outperforming state-of-the-art poisoning attacks designed for RAG-based LLMs. Additionally, we evaluated several defense mechanisms, all of which ultimately proved ineffective against Spa-VLM, underscoring the effectiveness and robustness of our attack.</p></details> |  |

Given the vast number of proteins involved, this process remains time-consuming and challenging. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks have supported Target ID; however, no benchmark currently exists for identifying the biological impacts of PPIs. To bridge this gap, we introduce the RAG Benchmark for PPIs (RAGPPI), a factual question-answer benchmark of 4,420 question-answer pairs that focus on the potential biological impacts of PPIs. Through interviews with experts, we identified criteria for a benchmark dataset, such as a type of QA and source. We built a gold-standard dataset (500 QA pairs) through expert-driven data annotation. We developed an ensemble auto-evaluation LLM that reflected expert labeling characteristics, which facilitates the construction of a silver-standard dataset (3,720 QA pairs). We are committed to maintaining RAGPPI as a resource to support the research community in advancing RAG systems for drug discovery QA solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 4 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

Our hypothesis is that by combining the pattern matching capabilities of modern AI tools with a natural multi-modal RAG LLM interface, problem identification and resolution can be simplified. ARCA is a new multi-modal RAG LLM system that targets this domain. Step-wise evaluations show that ARCA outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in EuroMLSys2025</p></details> |
| **[Divide-Then-Align: Honest Alignment based on the Knowledge Boundary of RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20871v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) augmented with retrieval systems have significantly advanced natural language processing tasks by integrating external knowledge sources, enabling more accurate and contextually rich responses. To improve the robustness of such systems against noisy retrievals, Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning (RAFT) has emerged as a widely adopted method. However, RAFT conditions models to generate answers even in the absence of reliable knowledge. This behavior undermines their reliability in high-stakes domains, where acknowledging uncertainty is critical. To address this issue, we propose Divide-Then-Align (DTA), a post-training approach designed to endow RAG systems with the ability to respond with "I don't know" when the query is out of the knowledge boundary of both the retrieved passages and the model's internal knowledge. DTA divides data samples into four knowledge quadrants and constructs tailored preference data for each quadrant, resulting in a curated dataset for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that DTA effectively balances accuracy with appropriate abstention, enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of retrieval-augmented systems.</p></details> | ACL 2025 main |
| **[GTR: Graph-Table-RAG for Cross-Table Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01346v3)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Beyond pure text, a substantial amount of knowledge is stored in tables. In real-world scenarios, user questions often require retrieving answers that are distributed across multiple tables. GraphRAG has recently attracted much attention for enhancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities by organizing external knowledge to address ad-hoc and complex questions, exemplifying a promising direction for cross-table question answering. In this paper, to address the current gap in available data, we first introduce a multi-table benchmark, MutliTableQA, comprising 60k tables and 25k user queries collected from real-world sources. Then, we propose the first Graph-Table-RAG framework, namely GTR, which reorganizes table corpora into a heterogeneous graph, employs a hierarchical coarse-to-fine retrieval process to extract the most relevant tables, and integrates graph-aware prompting for downstream LLMs' tabular reasoning. Extensive experiments show that GTR exhibits superior cross-table question-answering performance while maintaining high deployment efficiency, demonstrating its real-world practical applicability.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |
| **[DoctorRAG: Medical RAG Fusing Knowledge with Patient Analogy through Textual Gradients](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19538v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing medical RAG systems mainly leverage knowledge from medical knowledge bases, neglecting the crucial role of experiential knowledge derived from similar patient cases -- a key component of human clinical reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose DoctorRAG, a RAG framework that emulates doctor-like reasoning by integrating both explicit clinical knowledge and implicit case-based experience. DoctorRAG enhances retrieval precision by first allocating conceptual tags for queries and knowledge sources, together with a hybrid retrieval mechanism from both relevant knowledge and patient. In addition, a Med-TextGrad module using multi-agent textual gradients is integrated to ensure that the final output adheres to the retrieved knowledge and patient query. Comprehensive experiments on multilingual, multitask datasets demonstrate that DoctorRAG significantly outperforms strong baseline RAG models and gains improvements from iterative refinements. Our approach generates more accurate, relevant, and comprehensive responses, taking a step towards more doctor-like medical reasoning systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

A plethora of things in human life, such as lifestyle, health, and food are dependent on the environment and agriculture. It comes under our responsibility to support the environment as well as agriculture. However, traditional farming practices often result in inefficient resource use and environmental challenges. To address these issues, precision agriculture has emerged as a promising approach that leverages advanced technologies to optimise agricultural processes. In this work, a hybrid approach is proposed that combines the three different potential fields of model AI: object detection, large language model (LLM), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). In this novel framework, we have tried to combine the vision and language models to work together to identify potential diseases in the tree leaf. This study introduces a novel AI-based precision agriculture system that uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide context-aware diagnoses and natural language processing (NLP) and YOLOv8 for crop disease detection. The system aims to tackle major issues with large language models (LLMs), especially hallucinations and allows for adaptive treatment plans and real-time disease detection. The system provides an easy-to-use interface to the farmers, which they can use to detect the different diseases related to coffee leaves by just submitting the image of the affected leaf the model will detect the diseases as well as suggest potential remediation methodologies which aim to lower the use of pesticides, preserving livelihoods, and encouraging environmentally friendly methods. With an emphasis on scalability, dependability, and user-friendliness, the project intends to improve RAG-integrated object detection systems for wider agricultural applications in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>There...</summary><p>There are 14 pages, 8 figures</p></details> |
| **[Removal of Hallucination on Hallucination: Debate-Augmented RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18581v1)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances factual accuracy by integrating external knowledge, yet it introduces a critical issue: erroneous or biased retrieval can mislead generation, compounding hallucinations, a phenomenon we term Hallucination on Hallucination. To address this, we propose Debate-Augmented RAG (DRAG), a training-free framework that integrates Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) mechanisms into both retrieval and generation stages. In retrieval, DRAG employs structured debates among proponents, opponents, and judges to refine retrieval quality and ensure factual reliability. In generation, DRAG introduces asymmetric information roles and adversarial debates, enhancing reasoning robustness and mitigating factual inconsistencies. Evaluations across multiple tasks demonstrate that DRAG improves retrieval reliability, reduces RAG-induced hallucinations, and significantly enhances overall factual accuracy.
