| **[Benchmark Designers Should "Train on the Test Set" to Expose Exploitable Non-Visual Shortcuts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04655v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust benchmarks are crucial for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Yet we find that models can ace many multimodal benchmarks without strong visual understanding, instead exploiting biases, linguistic priors, and superficial patterns. This is especially problematic for vision-centric benchmarks that are meant to require visual inputs. We adopt a diagnostic principle for benchmark design: if a benchmark can be gamed, it will be. Designers should therefore try to ``game'' their own benchmarks first, using diagnostic and debiasing procedures to systematically identify and mitigate non-visual biases. Effective diagnosis requires directly ``training on the test set'' -- probing the released test set for its intrinsic, exploitable patterns. We operationalize this standard with two components. First, we diagnose benchmark susceptibility using a ``Test-set Stress-Test'' (TsT) methodology. Our primary diagnostic tool involves fine-tuning a powerful Large Language Model via $k$-fold cross-validation on exclusively the non-visual, textual inputs of the test set to reveal shortcut performance and assign each sample a bias score $s(x)$. We complement this with a lightweight Random Forest-based diagnostic operating on hand-crafted features for fast, interpretable auditing. Second, we debias benchmarks by filtering high-bias samples using an ``Iterative Bias Pruning'' (IBP) procedure. Applying this framework to four benchmarks -- VSI-Bench, CV-Bench, MMMU, and VideoMME -- we uncover pervasive non-visual biases. As a case study, we apply our full framework to create VSI-Bench-Debiased, demonstrating reduced non-visual solvability and a wider vision-blind performance gap than the original.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://cambrian-mllm.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Logit-Entropy Adaptive Stopping Heuristic for Efficient Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04654v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is a key technique for enabling complex reasoning in large language models. However, generating full, fixed-length rationales is computationally wasteful, inflating both token usage and latency. We introduce LEASH: Logit-Entropy Adaptive Stopping Heuristic, a training-free decoding algorithm that adaptively halts rationale generation. LEASH monitors two intrinsic signals: the slope of token-level entropy and the improvement in the top-logit margin. It terminates the generation once both signals plateau, indicating the model has reached a stable reasoning state. Across four instruction-tuned models on the GSM8K and AQuA-RAT benchmarks, LEASH reduces average token generation by 30--35% and latency by 27%, while incurring a 10 p.p. accuracy drop relative to CoT. LEASH is model-agnostic and requires no additional training or supervision, offering a simple and efficient alternative to CoT decoding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 1st Workshop on Efficient Reasoning (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[CancerGUIDE: Cancer Guideline Understanding via Internal Disagreement Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07325v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) provides evidence-based guidelines for cancer treatment. Translating complex patient presentations into guideline-compliant treatment recommendations is time-intensive, requires specialized expertise, and is prone to error. Advances in large language model (LLM) capabilities promise to reduce the time required to generate treatment recommendations and improve accuracy. We present an LLM agent-based approach to automatically generate guideline-concordant treatment trajectories for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our contributions are threefold. First, we construct a novel longitudinal dataset of 121 cases of NSCLC patients that includes clinical encounters, diagnostic results, and medical histories, each expertly annotated with the corresponding NCCN guideline trajectories by board-certified oncologists. Second, we demonstrate that existing LLMs possess domain-specific knowledge that enables high-quality proxy benchmark generation for both model development and evaluation, achieving strong correlation (Spearman coefficient r=0.88, RMSE = 0.08) with expert-annotated benchmarks. Third, we develop a hybrid approach combining expensive human annotations with model consistency information to create both the agent framework that predicts the relevant guidelines for a patient, as well as a meta-classifier that verifies prediction accuracy with calibrated confidence scores for treatment recommendations (AUROC=0.800), a critical capability for communicating the accuracy of outputs, custom-tailoring tradeoffs in performance, and supporting regulatory compliance. This work establishes a framework for clinically viable LLM-based guideline adherence systems that balance accuracy, interpretability, and regulatory requirements while reducing annotation costs, providing a scalable pathway toward automated clinical decision support.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Inference Schedules for Masked Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04647v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A major bottleneck of standard auto-regressive large language models is that their inference process is inherently sequential, resulting in very long and costly inference times. To circumvent this, practitioners proposed a class of language models called diffusion language models, of which the masked diffusion model (MDM) is the most successful. The MDM is able to sample tokens out-of-order and, ostensibly, many tokens at once and in parallel. However, there is very limited rigorous understanding of how much parallel sampling these models can perform without noticeable degradation in their sampling performance. Prior work of Li and Cai obtained some preliminary bounds, but these are not tight for many natural classes of distributions. In this work, we give a new, exact characterization of the expected divergence between the true distribution and the sampled distribution, for any distribution and any unmasking schedule for the sampler, showing an elegant connection to the theory of univariate function approximation. By leveraging this connection, we then attain a number of novel lower and upper bounds for this problem. While the connection to function approximation in principle gives the optimal unmasking schedule for any distribution, we show that it is in general impossible to compete with it without strong a priori knowledge of the distribution, even in seemingly benign settings. However, we also demonstrate new upper bounds and new sampling schedules in terms of well-studied information-theoretic properties of the base distribution, namely, its total correlation and dual total correlation, which show that in some natural settings, one can sample in $O(log n)$ steps without any visible loss in performance, where $n$ is the total sequence length.</p></details> | 33 pages, 1 figure |
| **[When retrieval outperforms generation: Dense evidence retrieval for scalable fake news detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04643v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of misinformation necessitates robust yet computationally efficient fact verification systems. While current state-of-the-art approaches leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating explanatory rationales, these methods face significant computational barriers and hallucination risks in real-world deployments. We present DeReC (Dense Retrieval Classification), a lightweight framework that demonstrates how general-purpose text embeddings can effectively replace autoregressive LLM-based approaches in fact verification tasks. By combining dense retrieval with specialized classification, our system achieves better accuracy while being significantly more efficient. DeReC outperforms explanation-generating LLMs in efficiency, reducing runtime by 95% on RAWFC (23 minutes 36 seconds compared to 454 minutes 12 seconds) and by 92% on LIAR-RAW (134 minutes 14 seconds compared to 1692 minutes 23 seconds), showcasing its effectiveness across varying dataset sizes. On the RAWFC dataset, DeReC achieves an F1 score of 65.58%, surpassing the state-of-the-art method L-Defense (61.20%). Our results demonstrate that carefully engineered retrieval-based systems can match or exceed LLM performance in specialized tasks while being significantly more practical for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[SnapStream: Efficient Long Sequence Decoding on Dataflow Accelerators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03092v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of 100B+ parameter Large Language Models (LLMs) with 100k+ context length support have resulted in increasing demands for on-chip memory to support large KV caches. Techniques such as StreamingLLM and SnapKV demonstrate how to control KV cache size while maintaining model accuracy. Yet, these techniques are not commonly used within industrial deployments using frameworks like vLLM or SGLang. The reason is twofold: on one hand, the static graphs and continuous batching methodology employed by these frameworks make it difficult to admit modifications to the standard multi-head attention algorithm, while on the other hand, the accuracy implications of such techniques on modern instruction-following and reasoning models are not well understood, obfuscating the need for implementing these techniques. In this paper, we explore these accuracy implications on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1, and develop SnapStream, a KV cache compression method that can be deployed at scale. We demonstrate the efficacy of SnapStream in a 16-way tensor-parallel deployment of DeepSeek-671B on SambaNova SN40L accelerators running at 128k context length and up to 1832 tokens per second in a real production setting. SnapStream enables $4\times$ improved on-chip memory usage and introduces minimal accuracy degradation on LongBench-v2, AIME24 and LiveCodeBench. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of sparse KV attention techniques deployed in a production inference system with static graphs and continuous batching.</p></details> |  |
| **[Memorization in Large Language Models in Medicine: Prevalence, Characteristics, and Implications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08604v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in medicine. To date, LLMs have been widely applied to tasks such as diagnostic assistance, medical question answering, and clinical information synthesis. However, a key open question remains: to what extent do LLMs memorize medical training data. In this study, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of memorization of LLMs in medicine, assessing its prevalence (how frequently it occurs), characteristics (what is memorized), volume (how much content is memorized), and potential downstream impacts (how memorization may affect medical applications). We systematically analyze common adaptation scenarios: (1) continued pretraining on medical corpora, (2) fine-tuning on standard medical benchmarks, and (3) fine-tuning on real-world clinical data, including over 13,000 unique inpatient records from Yale New Haven Health System. The results demonstrate that memorization is prevalent across all adaptation scenarios and significantly higher than reported in the general domain. Memorization affects both the development and adoption of LLMs in medicine and can be categorized into three types: beneficial (e.g., accurate recall of clinical guidelines and biomedical references), uninformative (e.g., repeated disclaimers or templated medical document language), and harmful (e.g., regeneration of dataset-specific or sensitive clinical content). Based on these findings, we offer practical recommendations to facilitate beneficial memorization that enhances domain-specific reasoning and factual accuracy, minimize uninformative memorization to promote deeper learning beyond surface-level patterns, and mitigate harmful memorization to prevent the leakage of sensitive or identifiable patient information.</p></details> |  |
| **[PixCLIP: Achieving Fine-grained Visual Language Understanding via Any-granularity Pixel-Text Alignment Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04601v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining(CLIP) model has achieved remarkable success in a variety of downstream vison language understanding tasks, enhancing its capability for fine-grained image-text alignment remains an active research focus. To this end, most existing works adopt the strategy of explicitly increasing the granularity of visual information processing, e.g., incorporating visual prompts to guide the model focus on specific local regions within the image. Meanwhile, researches on Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) have demonstrated that training with long and detailed textual descriptions can effectively improve the model's fine-grained vision-language alignment. However, the inherent token length limitation of CLIP's text encoder fundamentally limits CLIP to process more granular textual information embedded in long text sequences. To synergistically leverage the advantages of enhancing both visual and textual content processing granularity, we propose PixCLIP, a novel framework designed to concurrently accommodate visual prompt inputs and process lengthy textual descriptions. Specifically, we first establish an automated annotation pipeline capable of generating pixel-level localized, long-form textual descriptions for images. Utilizing this pipeline, we construct LongGRIT, a high-quality dataset comprising nearly 1.5 million samples. Secondly, we replace CLIP's original text encoder with the LLM and propose a three-branch pixel-text alignment learning framework, facilitating fine-grained alignment between image regions and corresponding textual descriptions at arbitrary granularity. Experiments demonstrate that PixCLIP showcases breakthroughs in pixel-level interaction and handling long-form texts, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Question the Questions: Auditing Representation in Online Deliberative Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04588v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A central feature of many deliberative processes, such as citizens' assemblies and deliberative polls, is the opportunity for participants to engage directly with experts. While participants are typically invited to propose questions for expert panels, only a limited number can be selected due to time constraints. This raises the challenge of how to choose a small set of questions that best represent the interests of all participants. We introduce an auditing framework for measuring the level of representation provided by a slate of questions, based on the social choice concept known as justified representation (JR). We present the first algorithms for auditing JR in the general utility setting, with our most efficient algorithm achieving a runtime of $O(mn\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of participants and $m$ is the number of proposed questions. We apply our auditing methods to historical deliberations, comparing the representativeness of (a) the actual questions posed to the expert panel (chosen by a moderator), (b) participants' questions chosen via integer linear programming, (c) summary questions generated by large language models (LLMs). Our results highlight both the promise and current limitations of LLMs in supporting deliberative processes. By integrating our methods into an online deliberation platform that has been used for over hundreds of deliberations across more than 50 countries, we make it easy for practitioners to audit and improve representation in future deliberations.</p></details> |  |
| **[VISTA Score: Verification In Sequential Turn-based Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27052v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucination--defined here as generating statements unsupported or contradicted by available evidence or conversational context--remains a major obstacle to deploying conversational AI systems in settings that demand factual reliability. Existing metrics either evaluate isolated responses or treat unverifiable content as errors, limiting their use for multi-turn dialogue. We introduce VISTA (Verification In Sequential Turn-based Assessment), a framework for evaluating conversational factuality through claim-level verification and sequential consistency tracking. VISTA decomposes each assistant turn into atomic factual claims, verifies them against trusted sources and dialogue history, and categorizes unverifiable statements (subjective, contradicted, lacking evidence, or abstaining). Across eight large language models and four dialogue factuality benchmarks (AIS, BEGIN, FAITHDIAL, and FADE), VISTA substantially improves hallucination detection over FACTSCORE and LLM-as-Judge baselines. Human evaluation confirms that VISTA's decomposition improves annotator agreement and reveals inconsistencies in existing benchmarks. By modeling factuality as a dynamic property of conversation, VISTA offers a more transparent, human-aligned measure of truthfulness in dialogue systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[SurgViVQA: Temporally-Grounded Video Question Answering for Surgical Scene Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03325v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Question Answering (VideoQA) in the surgical domain aims to enhance intraoperative understanding by enabling AI models to reason over temporally coherent events rather than isolated frames. Current approaches are limited to static image features, and available datasets often lack temporal annotations, ignoring the dynamics critical for accurate procedural interpretation. We propose SurgViVQA, a surgical VideoQA model that extends visual reasoning from static images to dynamic surgical scenes. It uses a Masked Video--Text Encoder to fuse video and question features, capturing temporal cues such as motion and tool--tissue interactions, which a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) then decodes into coherent answers. To evaluate its performance, we curated REAL-Colon-VQA, a colonoscopic video dataset that includes motion-related questions and diagnostic attributes, as well as out-of-template questions with rephrased or semantically altered formulations to assess model robustness. Experimental validation on REAL-Colon-VQA and the public EndoVis18-VQA dataset shows that SurgViVQA outperforms existing image-based VQA benchmark models, particularly in keyword accuracy, improving over PitVQA by +11\% on REAL-Colon-VQA and +9\% on EndoVis18-VQA. A perturbation study on the questions further confirms improved generalizability and robustness to variations in question phrasing. SurgViVQA and the REAL-Colon-VQA dataset provide a framework for temporally-aware understanding in surgical VideoQA, enabling AI models to interpret dynamic procedural contexts more effectively.

| **[ARETE: an R package for Automated REtrieval from TExt with large language models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04573v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>1. A hard stop for the implementation of rigorous conservation initiatives is our lack of key species data, especially occurrence data. Furthermore, researchers have to contend with an accelerated speed at which new information must be collected and processed due to anthropogenic activity. Publications ranging from scientific papers to gray literature contain this crucial information but their data are often not machine-readable, requiring extensive human work to be retrieved. 2. We present the ARETE R package, an open-source software aiming to automate data extraction of species occurrences powered by large language models, namely using the chatGPT Application Programming Interface. This R package integrates all steps of the data extraction and validation process, from Optical Character Recognition to detection of outliers and output in tabular format. Furthermore, we validate ARETE through systematic comparison between what is modelled and the work of human annotators. 3. We demonstrate the usefulness of the approach by comparing range maps produced using GBIF data and with those automatically extracted for 100 species of spiders. Newly extracted data allowed to expand the known Extent of Occurrence by a mean three orders of magnitude, revealing new areas where the species were found in the past, which mayhave important implications for spatial conservation planning and extinction risk assessments. 4. ARETE allows faster access to hitherto untapped occurrence data, a potential game changer in projects requiring such data. Researchers will be able to better prioritize resources, manually verifying selected species while maintaining automated extraction for the majority. This workflow also allows predicting available bibliographic data during project planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Thinking with Video: Video Generation as a Promising Multimodal Reasoning Paradigm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04570v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>"Thinking with Text" and "Thinking with Images" paradigm significantly improve the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs). However, these paradigms have inherent limitations. (1) Images capture only single moments and fail to represent dynamic processes or continuous changes, and (2) The separation of text and vision as distinct modalities, hindering unified multimodal understanding and generation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce "Thinking with Video", a new paradigm that leverages video generation models, such as Sora-2, to bridge visual and textual reasoning in a unified temporal framework. To support this exploration, we developed the Video Thinking Benchmark (VideoThinkBench). VideoThinkBench encompasses two task categories: (1) vision-centric tasks (e.g., Eyeballing Puzzles), and (2) text-centric tasks (e.g., subsets of GSM8K, MMMU). Our evaluation establishes Sora-2 as a capable reasoner. On vision-centric tasks, Sora-2 is generally comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLMs, and even surpasses VLMs on several tasks, such as Eyeballing Games. On text-centric tasks, Sora-2 achieves 92% accuracy on MATH, and 75.53% accuracy on MMMU. Furthermore, we systematically analyse the source of these abilities. We also find that self-consistency and in-context learning can improve Sora-2's performance. In summary, our findings demonstrate that the video generation model is the potential unified multimodal understanding and generation model, positions "thinking with video" as a unified multimodal reasoning paradigm.</p></details> | 36 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Homogeneous Keys, Heterogeneous Values: Exploiting Local KV Cache Asymmetry for Long-Context LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05410v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have highlighted the critical importance of extending context length, yet the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms poses significant challenges for efficient long-context modeling. KV cache compression has emerged as a key approach to address this challenge. Through extensive empirical analysis, we reveal a fundamental yet previously overlooked asymmetry in KV caches: while adjacent keys receive similar attention weights ({\it local homogeneity}), adjacent values demonstrate distinct {\it heterogeneous} distributions. This key-value asymmetry reveals a critical limitation in existing compression methods that treat keys and values uniformly. To address the limitation, we propose a training-free compression framework (AsymKV) that combines homogeneity-based key merging with a mathematically proven lossless value compression. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AsymKV consistently outperforms existing long-context methods across various tasks and base models. For example, on LLaMA3.1-8B, AsymKV achieves an average score of 43.95 on LongBench, surpassing SOTA methods like H$_2$O (38.89) by a large margin.Our code can be found in this link:https://github.com/the-scale-lab/Asymkv.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages,7 figures;Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

We investigate how Large Language Models (LLM) can effectively act as world models of user preferences through pairwise reasoning over slates. We conduct an empirical study involving several LLMs on three tasks spanning different datasets. Our results reveal relationships between task performance and properties of the preference function captured by LLMs, hinting towards areas for improvement and highlighting the potential of LLMs as world models in recommender systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Autonomous Engineering Design: A Knowledge-Guided Multi-Agent Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03179v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The engineering design process often demands expertise from multiple domains, leading to complex collaborations and iterative refinements. Traditional methods can be resource-intensive and prone to inefficiencies. To address this, we formalize the engineering design process through a multi-agent AI framework that integrates structured design and review loops. The framework introduces specialized knowledge-driven agents that collaborate to generate and refine design candidates. As an exemplar, we demonstrate its application to the aerodynamic optimization of 4-digit NACA airfoils. The framework consists of three key AI agents: a Graph Ontologist, a Design Engineer, and a Systems Engineer. The Graph Ontologist employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to construct two domain-specific knowledge graphs from airfoil design literature. The Systems Engineer, informed by a human manager, formulates technical requirements that guide design generation and evaluation. The Design Engineer leverages the design knowledge graph and computational tools to propose candidate airfoils meeting these requirements. The Systems Engineer reviews and provides feedback both qualitative and quantitative using its own knowledge graph, forming an iterative feedback loop until a design is validated by the manager. The final design is then optimized to maximize performance metrics such as the lift-to-drag ratio. Overall, this work demonstrates how collaborative AI agents equipped with structured knowledge representations can enhance efficiency, consistency, and quality in the engineering design process.</p></details> | Revised to fix typos |

We present OceanAI, a conversational platform that integrates the natural-language fluency of open-source large language models (LLMs) with real-time, parameterized access to authoritative oceanographic data streams hosted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Each query such as "What was Boston Harbor's highest water level in 2024?" triggers real-time API calls that identify, parse, and synthesize relevant datasets into reproducible natural-language responses and data visualizations. In a blind comparison with three widely used AI chat-interface products, only OceanAI produced NOAA-sourced values with original data references; others either declined to answer or provided unsupported results. Designed for extensibility, OceanAI connects to multiple NOAA data products and variables, supporting applications in marine hazard forecasting, ecosystem assessment, and water-quality monitoring. By grounding outputs and verifiable observations, OceanAI advances transparency, reproducibility, and trust, offering a scalable framework for AI-enabled decision support within the oceans.

While a number of LLM code security benchmarks have been proposed alongside approaches to improve the security of generated code, it remains unclear to what extent they have impacted widely used coding LLMs. Here, we show that even the latest open-weight models are vulnerable in the earliest reported vulnerability scenarios in a realistic use setting, suggesting that the safety-functionality trade-off has until now prevented effective patching of vulnerabilities. To help address this issue, we introduce a new severity metric that reflects the risk posed by an LLM-generated vulnerability, accounting for vulnerability severity, generation chance, and the formulation of the prompt that induces vulnerable code generation - Prompt Exposure (PE). To encourage the mitigation of the most serious and prevalent vulnerabilities, we use PE to define the Model Exposure (ME) score, which indicates the severity and prevalence of vulnerabilities a model generates.</p></details> |  |

The main issue discussed in this paper is how traditional rule-based and signature based security systems are not enough to deal with modern AI powered cyber threats. Cybersecurity industry is changing as threats are becoming more dangerous and adaptive in nature by levering the features provided by AI tools. By integrating LLMs into these tools and protocols, make the systems scalable, context-aware and intelligent. Thus helping it to mitigate these evolving cyber threats. The paper studies the architecture and functioning of LLMs, its integration into Encrypted prompts to prevent prompt injection attacks. It also studies the integration of LLMs into cybersecurity tools using a four layered architecture. At last, the paper has tried to explain various ways of integration LLMs into traditional Intrusion Detection System and enhancing its original abilities in various dimensions. The key findings of this paper has been (i)Encrypted Prompt with LLM is an effective way to mitigate prompt injection attacks, (ii) LLM enhanced cyber security tools are more accurate, scalable and adaptable to new threats as compared to traditional models, (iii) The decoupled model approach for LLM integration into IDS is the best way as it is the most accurate way.</p></details> |  |

Existing evaluation frameworks often rely on heuristic-based metrics that fail to capture domain-specific nuances and other works utilize LLM-as-a-Judge approaches that lack validated alignment with human judgment. This paper introduces RAGalyst, an automated, human-aligned agentic framework designed for the rigorous evaluation of domain-specific RAG systems. RAGalyst features an agentic pipeline that generates high-quality, synthetic question-answering (QA) datasets from source documents, incorporating an agentic filtering step to ensure data fidelity. The framework refines two key LLM-as-a-Judge metrics-Answer Correctness and Answerability-using prompt optimization to achieve a strong correlation with human annotations. Applying this framework to evaluate various RAG components across three distinct domains (military operations, cybersecurity, and bridge engineering), we find that performance is highly context-dependent. No single embedding model, LLM, or hyperparameter configuration proves universally optimal. Additionally, we provide an analysis on the most common low Answer Correctness reasons in RAG. These findings highlight the necessity of a systematic evaluation framework like RAGalyst, which empowers practitioners to uncover domain-specific trade-offs and make informed design choices for building reliable and effective RAG systems. RAGalyst is available on our Github.</p></details> |  |

Yet how closely LLMs mirror actual human decision-making remains poorly understood. This gap is critical: misalignment could produce harmful outcomes in practical applications, while failure to replicate human behavior renders LLMs ineffective for social simulations. Here, we address this gap by developing a digital twin of game-theoretic experiments and introducing a systematic prompting and probing framework for machine-behavioral evaluation. Testing three open-source models (Llama, Mistral and Qwen), we find that Llama reproduces human cooperation patterns with high fidelity, capturing human deviations from rational choice theory, while Qwen aligns closely with Nash equilibrium predictions. Notably, we achieved population-level behavioral replication without persona-based prompting, simplifying the simulation process. Extending beyond the original human-tested games, we generate and preregister testable hypotheses for novel game configurations outside the original parameter grid. Our findings demonstrate that appropriately calibrated LLMs can replicate aggregate human behavioral patterns and enable systematic exploration of unexplored experimental spaces, offering a complementary approach to traditional research in the social and behavioral sciences that generates new empirical predictions about human social decision-making.</p></details> |  |

This paper systematically evaluates six LLMs, applying the Big Five Inventory-2 (BFI-2) framework, to assess trait expressions under varying sampling temperatures. We find significant differences across four of the five personality dimensions, with Neuroticism and Extraversion susceptible to temperature adjustments. Further, hierarchical clustering reveals distinct model clusters, suggesting that architectural features may predispose certain models toward stable trait profiles.

In this work, we investigate how the quality of LLM responses changes in terms of information accuracy, truthfulness, and refusals depending on three user traits: English proficiency, education level, and country of origin. We present extensive experimentation on three state-of-the-art LLMs and two different datasets targeting truthfulness and factuality. Our findings suggest that undesirable behaviors in state-of-the-art LLMs occur disproportionately more for users with lower English proficiency, of lower education status, and originating from outside the US, rendering these models unreliable sources of information towards their most vulnerable users.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[RUST-BENCH: Benchmarking LLM Reasoning on Unstructured Text within Structured Tables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04491v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing tabular reasoning benchmarks mostly test models on small, uniform tables, underrepresenting the complexity of real-world data and giving an incomplete view of Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning abilities. Real tables are long, heterogeneous, and domain-specific, mixing structured fields with free text and requiring multi-hop reasoning across thousands of tokens. To address this gap, we introduce RUST-BENCH, a benchmark of 7966 questions from 2031 real-world tables spanning two domains: i) RB-Science (NSF grant records) and ii) RB-Sports (NBA statistics). Unlike prior work, RUST-BENCH evaluates LLMs jointly across scale, heterogeneity, domain specificity, and reasoning complexity. Experiments with open-source and proprietary models show that LLMs struggle with heterogeneous schemas and complex multi-hop inference, revealing persistent weaknesses in current architectures and prompting strategies. RUST-BENCH establishes a challenging new testbed for advancing tabular reasoning research.</p></details> |  |

This study starts to bridge that gap through inductive analysis of interviews with non-experts (N = 28) focusing on large-language models in general and their bad behavior, specifically. Results suggest bad behaviors are not especially salient when people discuss AI generally but the notion of AI behaving badly is easily engaged when prompted, and bad behavior becomes even more salient when evaluating specific AI behaviors. Types of observed behaviors considered bad mostly align with their inspiring moral foundations; across all observed behaviors, some variations on non-performance and social discordance were present. By scaffolding findings at the intersections of moral foundations theory, construal level theory, and moral dyadism, a tentative framework for considering AI bad behavior is proposed.</p></details> |  |

They can autonomously interact with the internet at the user's behest, such as navigating websites, filling search masks, and comparing price lists. Though web agent research is thriving, induced sustainability issues remain largely unexplored. To highlight the urgency of this issue, we provide an initial exploration of the energy and $CO_2$ cost associated with web agents from both a theoretical -via estimation- and an empirical perspective -by benchmarking. Our results show how different philosophies in web agent creation can severely impact the associated expended energy, and that more energy consumed does not necessarily equate to better results. We highlight a lack of transparency regarding disclosing model parameters and processes used for some web agents as a limiting factor when estimating energy consumption. Our work contributes towards a change in thinking of how we evaluate web agents, advocating for dedicated metrics measuring energy consumption in benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026 AISI</p></details> |

We present LiveSearchBench, an automated pipeline for constructing retrieval-dependent benchmarks from recent knowledge updates. Our method computes deltas between successive Wikidata snapshots, filters candidate triples for quality, and synthesizes natural-language questions at three levels of reasoning difficulty, each guaranteed to admit a unique, verifiable answer through SPARQL validation. The pipeline is fully automated, scalable across time, and minimizes human intervention, enabling continual regeneration of temporally grounded benchmarks. Experiments show a pronounced performance drop when models confront facts that post-date pretraining, with the gap most salient on multi-hop queries. Retrieval augmented methods and larger, instruction-tuned models provide partial gains but fail to close this recency gap. By design, LiveSearchBench shifts evaluation from static memorization toward tasks that require up-to-date retrieval and reasoning, offering a foundation for systematic, long-term assessment of LLMs under evolving knowledge.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enabling Dynamic Sparsity in Quantized LLM Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04477v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying large language models (LLMs) on end-user devices is gaining importance due to benefits in responsiveness, privacy, and operational cost. Yet the limited memory and compute capability of mobile and desktop GPUs make efficient execution difficult. Recent observations suggest that the internal activations of LLMs are often dynamically sparse, meaning that for each input, only part of the network contributes significantly to the output. Such sparsity could reduce computation, but it interacts poorly with group-wise quantization, which remains the dominant approach for fitting LLMs onto resource-constrained hardware. To reconcile these two properties, this study proposes a set of techniques that realize dynamic sparse inference under low-bit quantization. The method features: (1) a zigzag-patterned quantization layout that organizes weights in a way consistent with activation sparsity and improves GPU memory locality; (2) a specialized GEMV kernel designed for this layout to fully utilize parallel compute units; and (3) a compact runtime mechanism that gathers sparse indices with minimal overhead. Across several model scales and hardware configurations, the approach achieves up to 1.55x faster decoding throughput while maintaining accuracy comparable to dense quantized inference, showing that structured sparsity and quantization can effectively coexist on commodity GPUs.</p></details> |  |

A Benchmark of Knowledge-Grounded Discussion Summarization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12474v3)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional dialogue summarization primarily focuses on dialogue content, assuming it comprises adequate information for a clear summary. However, this assumption often fails for discussions grounded in shared background, where participants frequently omit context and use implicit references. This results in summaries that are confusing to readers unfamiliar with the background. To address this, we introduce Knowledge-Grounded Discussion Summarization (KGDS), a novel task that produces a supplementary background summary for context and a clear opinion summary with clarified references. To facilitate research, we construct the first KGDS benchmark, featuring news-discussion pairs and expert-created multi-granularity gold annotations for evaluating sub-summaries. We also propose a novel hierarchical evaluation framework with fine-grained and interpretable metrics. Our extensive evaluation of 12 advanced large language models (LLMs) reveals that KGDS remains a significant challenge. The models frequently miss key facts and retain irrelevant ones in background summarization, and often fail to resolve implicit references in opinion summary integration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AACL-IJCNLP 2025 Main</p></details> |
| **[Benchmarking LLM Faithfulness in RAG with Evolving Leaderboards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04847v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) aims to reduce hallucinations by grounding responses in external context, yet large language models (LLMs) still frequently introduce unsupported information or contradictions even when provided with relevant context. This paper presents two complementary efforts at Vectara to measure and benchmark LLM faithfulness in RAG. First, we describe our original hallucination leaderboard, which has tracked hallucination rates for LLMs since 2023 using our HHEM hallucination detection model. Motivated by limitations observed in current hallucination detection methods, we introduce FaithJudge, an LLM-as-a-judge framework that leverages a pool of diverse human-annotated hallucination examples to substantially improve the automated hallucination evaluation of LLMs. We introduce an enhanced hallucination leaderboard centered on FaithJudge that benchmarks LLMs on RAG faithfulness in summarization, question-answering, and data-to-text generation tasks. FaithJudge enables a more reliable benchmarking of LLM hallucinations in RAG and supports the development of more trustworthy generative AI systems: https://github.com/vectara/FaithJudge.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP Industry Track 2025</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Shortest Path: Agentic Vehicular Routing with Semantic Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04464v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional vehicle routing systems efficiently optimize singular metrics like time or distance, and when considering multiple metrics, they need more processes to optimize . However, they lack the capability to interpret and integrate the complex, semantic, and dynamic contexts of human drivers, such as multi-step tasks, situational constraints, or urgent needs. This paper introduces and evaluates PAVe (Personalized Agentic Vehicular Routing), a hybrid agentic assistant designed to augment classical pathfinding algorithms with contextual reasoning. Our approach employs a Large Language Model (LLM) agent that operates on a candidate set of routes generated by a multi-objective (time, CO2) Dijkstra algorithm. The agent evaluates these options against user-provided tasks, preferences, and avoidance rules by leveraging a pre-processed geospatial cache of urban Points of Interest (POIs). In a benchmark of realistic urban scenarios, PAVe successfully used complex user intent into appropriate route modifications, achieving over 88% accuracy in its initial route selections with a local model. We conclude that combining classical routing algorithms with an LLM-based semantic reasoning layer is a robust and effective approach for creating personalized, adaptive, and scalable solutions for urban mobility optimization.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, this paper presents a semantics-guided fuzzy control framework that couples Large Language Models (LLMs) with interpretable control and lightweight coordination. Raw multimodal observations are compressed by the LLM into compact, human-interpretable semantic tokens that summarize obstacles, unexplored regions, and Objects Of Interest (OOIs) under uncertain perception. A fuzzy inference system with pre-defined membership functions then maps these tokens into smooth and stable steering and gait commands, enabling reliable navigation without relying on global positioning. Then, we further coordinate multiple robots by introducing semantic communication that shares intent and local context in linguistic form, enabling agreement on who explores where while avoiding redundant revisits. Extensive simulations in unknown reef-like environments show that, under limited sensing and communication, the proposed framework achieves robust OOI-oriented navigation and cooperative coverage with improved efficiency and adaptability, narrowing the gap between semantic cognition and distributed underwater control in GPS-denied, map-free conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing.

However, the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) by crowdsourcing workers poses a significant challenge: datasets intended to reflect human input may be compromised by LLM-generated responses. Existing LLM detection approaches often rely on high-dimensional training data such as text, making them unsuitable for annotation tasks like multiple-choice labeling. In this work, we investigate the potential of peer prediction -- a mechanism that evaluates the information within workers' responses without using ground truth -- to mitigate LLM-assisted cheating in crowdsourcing with a focus on annotation tasks. Our approach quantifies the correlations between worker answers while conditioning on (a subset of) LLM-generated labels available to the requester. Building on prior research, we propose a training-free scoring mechanism with theoretical guarantees under a crowdsourcing model that accounts for LLM collusion. We establish conditions under which our method is effective and empirically demonstrate its robustness in detecting low-effort cheating on real-world crowdsourcing datasets.</p></details> | 32 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Speed at the Cost of Quality? The Impact of LLM Agent Assistance on Software Development](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04427v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the promise to revolutionize the field of software engineering. Among other things, LLM agents are rapidly gaining momentum in their application to software development, with practitioners claiming a multifold productivity increase after adoption. Yet, empirical evidence is lacking around these claims. In this paper, we estimate the causal effect of adopting a widely popular LLM agent assistant, namely Cursor, on development velocity and software quality. The estimation is enabled by a state-of-the-art difference-in-differences design comparing Cursor-adopting GitHub projects with a matched control group of similar GitHub projects that do not use Cursor. We find that the adoption of Cursor leads to a significant, large, but transient increase in project-level development velocity, along with a significant and persistent increase in static analysis warnings and code complexity. Further panel generalized method of moments estimation reveals that the increase in static analysis warnings and code complexity acts as a major factor causing long-term velocity slowdown. Our study carries implications for software engineering practitioners, LLM agent assistant designers, and researchers.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Illusion of Certainty: Uncertainty quantification for LLMs fails under ambiguity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04418v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate uncertainty quantification (UQ) in Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for trustworthy deployment. While real-world language is inherently ambiguous, reflecting aleatoric uncertainty, existing UQ methods are typically benchmarked against tasks with no ambiguity. In this work, we demonstrate that while current uncertainty estimators perform well under the restrictive assumption of no ambiguity, they degrade to close-to-random performance on ambiguous data. To this end, we introduce MAQA* and AmbigQA*, the first ambiguous question-answering (QA) datasets equipped with ground-truth answer distributions estimated from factual co-occurrence. We find this performance deterioration to be consistent across different estimation paradigms: using the predictive distribution itself, internal representations throughout the model, and an ensemble of models. We show that this phenomenon can be theoretically explained, revealing that predictive-distribution and ensemble-based estimators are fundamentally limited under ambiguity. Overall, our study reveals a key shortcoming of current UQ methods for LLMs and motivates a rethinking of current modeling paradigms.</p></details> |  |
| **[QCircuitBench: A Large-Scale Dataset for Benchmarking Quantum Algorithm Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07961v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computing is an emerging field recognized for the significant speedup it offers over classical computing through quantum algorithms. However, designing and implementing quantum algorithms pose challenges due to the complex nature of quantum mechanics and the necessity for precise control over quantum states. Despite the significant advancements in AI, there has been a lack of datasets specifically tailored for this purpose. In this work, we introduce QCircuitBench, the first benchmark dataset designed to evaluate AI's capability in designing and implementing quantum algorithms using quantum programming languages. Unlike using AI for writing traditional codes, this task is fundamentally more complicated due to highly flexible design space. Our key contributions include: 1. A general framework which formulates the key features of quantum algorithm design for Large Language Models. 2. Implementations for quantum algorithms from basic primitives to advanced applications, spanning 3 task suites, 25 algorithms, and 120,290 data points. 3. Automatic validation and verification functions, allowing for iterative evaluation and interactive reasoning without human inspection. 4. Promising potential as a training dataset through preliminary fine-tuning results. We observed several interesting experimental phenomena: LLMs tend to exhibit consistent error patterns, and fine-tuning does not always outperform few-shot learning. In all, QCircuitBench is a comprehensive benchmark for LLM-driven quantum algorithm design, and it reveals limitations of LLMs in this domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 17 figures, 15 tables, GitHub repository: https://github.com/EstelYang/QCircuitBench</p></details> |
| **[Post-Training LLMs as Better Decision-Making Agents: A Regret-Minimization Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04393v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as "agents" for decision-making (DM) in interactive and dynamic environments. Yet, since they were not originally designed for DM, recent studies show that LLMs can struggle even in basic online DM problems, failing to achieve low regret or an effective exploration-exploitation tradeoff. To address this, we introduce Iterative Regret-Minimization Fine-Tuning (Iterative RMFT), a post-training procedure that repeatedly distills low-regret decision trajectories back into the base model. At each iteration, the model rolls out multiple decision trajectories, selects the k-lowest regret ones, and fine-tunes itself on them. Unlike prior methods that (a) distill action sequences from known DM algorithms or (b) rely on manually crafted chain-of-thought templates, our approach leverages the regret metric to elicit the model's own DM ability and reasoning rationales. This reliance on model-generated reasoning avoids rigid output engineering and provides more flexible, natural-language training signals. Empirical results show that Iterative RMFT improves LLMs' DM performance across diverse models - from Transformers with numerical input/output, to open-weight LLMs, and advanced closed-weight models like GPT-4o mini. Its flexibility in output and reasoning formats enables generalization across tasks with varying horizons, action spaces, reward processes, and natural-language contexts. Finally, we provide theoretical insight showing that a single-layer Transformer under this paradigm can act as a no-regret learner in a simplified setting. Overall, Iterative RMFT offers a principled and general post-training framework for enhancing LLMs' decision-making capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[APRMCTS: Improving LLM-based Automated Program Repair with Iterative Tree Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01827v3)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Program Repair (APR) attempts to fix software bugs without human intervention, which plays a crucial role in software development and maintenance. Recently, with the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), a rapidly increasing number of APR techniques have been proposed with remarkable performance. However, existing LLM-based APR techniques typically adopt trial-and-error strategies, which suffer from two major drawbacks: (1) inherently limited patch effectiveness due to local exploration, and (2) low search efficiency due to redundant exploration. In this paper, we propose APRMCTS, which uses iterative tree search to improve LLM-based APR. APRMCTS incorporates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into patch searching by performing a global evaluation of the explored patches and selecting the most promising one for subsequent refinement and generation. APRMCTS effectively resolves the problems of falling into local optima and thus helps improve the efficiency of patch searching. Our experiments on 835 bugs from Defects4J demonstrate that, when integrated with GPT-3.5, APRMCTS can fix a total of 201 bugs, which outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines. Besides, APRMCTS helps GPT-4o-mini, GPT-3.5, Yi-Coder-9B, and Qwen2.5-Coder-7B to fix 30, 27, 37, and 28 more bugs, respectively. More importantly, APRMCTS boasts a significant performance advantage while employing small patch size (16 and 32), notably fewer than the 500 and 10,000 patches adopted in previous studies. In terms of cost, compared to existing state-of-the-art LLM-based APR methods, APRMCTS has time and monetary costs of less than 20% and 50%, respectively. Our extensive study demonstrates that APRMCTS exhibits good effectiveness and efficiency, with particular advantages in addressing complex bugs.</p></details> |  |
| **[HPC-Vis: A Visual Analytic System for Interactive Exploration of Historical Painter Cohorts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04383v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>More than ten thousand Chinese historical painters are recorded in the literature; their cohort analysis has always been a key area of research on Chinese painting history for both professional historians and amateur enthusiasts. However, these painters have very diverse artistic styles and an extremely complex network of inheritance relationships (e.g., master-apprentice or style imitation relationships); traditional cohort analysis methods not only heavily rely on field experience, but also cost a lot of time and effort with numerous but scattered historical documents. In this paper, we propose HPC-Vis, a visual analytical system for interactive exploration of historical painter cohorts. Firstly, a three-stage reconstruction algorithm for inheritance relationships of painters is proposed, which automatically converts the complex relationship graph of historical painters into a forest structure that contains multiple trees with clear inheriting chains, and we visually encoded this forest as a mountain map to intuitively show potential cohorts of historical painters. Secondly, a unified artistic style label system with three levels (i.e., subjects, techniques, and emotions) is established by using large language models, and it is further visually encoded as a new foldable nested doughnut chart. Finally, a visually guided human-computer collaborative interactive exploration mechanism is constructed, in which a painter cohort recommendation model is designed by integrating style, identity, time, space, and relationships. Two case studies and a user study demonstrate the advantage of HPC-Vis on assisting historians in discovering, defining, and validating cohorts of historical painters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Aligning Multimodal LLMs with Human Experts: A Focus on Parent-Child Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04366v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in human-centred AI systems, their ability to understand complex social interactions remains uncertain. We present an exploratory study on aligning MLLMs with speech-language pathologists (SLPs) in analysing joint attention in parent-child interactions, a key construct in early social-communicative development. Drawing on interviews and video annotations with three SLPs, we characterise how observational cues of gaze, action, and vocalisation inform their reasoning processes. We then test whether an MLLM can approximate this workflow through a two-stage prompting, separating observation from judgment. Our findings reveal that alignment is more robust at the observation layer, where experts share common descriptors, than at the judgement layer, where interpretive criteria diverge. We position this work as a case-based probe into expert-AI alignment in complex social behaviour, highlighting both the feasibility and the challenges of applying MLLMs to socially situated interaction analysis.</p></details> | work in progress |

This commentary evaluates the potential of LLMs to improve clinical prediction models (CPMs) for diagnostic and prognostic tasks, with a focus on their ability to process longitudinal electronic health record (EHR) data. Findings: LLMs show promise in handling multimodal and longitudinal EHR data and can support multi-outcome predictions for diverse health conditions. However, methodological, validation, infrastructural, and regulatory chal- lenges remain. These include inadequate methods for time-to-event modelling, poor calibration of predictions, limited external validation, and bias affecting underrepresented groups. High infrastructure costs and the absence of clear regulatory frameworks further prevent adoption. Implications: Further work and interdisciplinary collaboration are needed to support equitable and effective integra- tion into the clinical prediction. Developing temporally aware, fair, and explainable models should be a priority focus for transforming clinical prediction workflow.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published: BMC Diagnostic and Prognostic Research</p></details> |

Benchmarks and leaderboards are increasingly popular, offering quantitative rankings of LLMs. However, they provide limited insight into the tasks that LLMs consistently fail to solve - information that is crucial for understanding current limitations and guiding the development of more capable models. To address this gap, we examined code generation tasks across four popular benchmarks, identifying those that major LLMs are most likely to fail. To understand the causes of these failures, we investigated whether the static complexity of solution code contributes to them, followed by a systematic inspection of 114 tasks that LLMs consistently struggled with. Our analysis revealed four recurring patterns of weaknesses in LLMs, as well as common complications within benchmark tasks that most often lead to failure.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in Proceedings of 2025 2nd IEEE/ACM International Conference on AI-powered Software (AIware), Data & Benchmark Track</p></details> |

However, a critical question remains: do these models possess genuine reasoning skills particularly complex strategic reasoning or are they primarily excelling at sophisticated pattern recognition within their training data? To address this question, this paper presents a chess testbed, ChessArena, to evaluate the strategic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Chess requires complex strategic reasoning capabilities including long-term planning, strict rule comprehension, and multi-turn conversation memorization. Specifically, ChessArena is a competitive framework where LLMs play against each other, under four different play modes. The testbed is equipped with a ranking algorithm and a leaderboard. The testbed can also evaluate fine-grained capabilities including basic understanding, move selection, and puzzle solving. Over 13 LLMs with different modes are evaluated in ChessArena, playing over 800 games. The results reveal significant shortcomings in current LLMs: no model can beat Maia-1100 (a chess engine at human amateur level), while some even failed to defeat a random player that selects moves arbitrarily. We also present a strong baseline to the testbed: our fine-tuned Qwen3-8B substantially improved performance, approaching much larger state-of-the-art reasoning models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Small Singular Values Matter: A Random Matrix Analysis of Transformer Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17770v3)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work analyzes singular-value spectra of weight matrices in pretrained transformer models to understand how information is stored at both ends of the spectrum. Using Random Matrix Theory (RMT) as a zero information hypothesis, we associate agreement with RMT as evidence of randomness and deviations as evidence for learning. Surprisingly, we observe pronounced departures from RMT not only among the largest singular values -- the usual outliers -- but also among the smallest ones. A comparison of the associated singular vectors with the eigenvectors of the activation covariance matrices shows that there is considerable overlap wherever RMT is violated. Thus, significant directions in the data are captured by small singular values and their vectors as well as by the large ones. We confirm this empirically: zeroing out the singular values that deviate from RMT raises language-model perplexity far more than removing values from the bulk, and after fine-tuning the smallest decile can be the third most influential part of the spectrum. To explain how vectors linked to small singular values can carry more information than those linked to larger values, we propose a linear random-matrix model. Our findings highlight the overlooked importance of the low end of the spectrum and provide theoretical and practical guidance for SVD-based pruning and compression of large language models.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

Early EEG decoding methods rely on supervised learning, limited by specific tasks and datasets, hindering model performance and generalizability. With the success of large language models, there is a growing body of studies focusing on EEG foundation models. However, these studies still leave challenges: Firstly, most of existing EEG foundation models employ full EEG modeling strategy. It models the spatial and temporal dependencies between all EEG patches together, but ignores that the spatial and temporal dependencies are heterogeneous due to the unique structural characteristics of EEG signals. Secondly, existing EEG foundation models have limited generalizability on a wide range of downstream BCI tasks due to varying formats of EEG data, making it challenging to adapt to. To address these challenges, we propose a novel foundation model called CBraMod. Specifically, we devise a criss-cross transformer as the backbone to thoroughly leverage the structural characteristics of EEG signals, which can model spatial and temporal dependencies separately through two parallel attention mechanisms. And we utilize an asymmetric conditional positional encoding scheme which can encode positional information of EEG patches and be easily adapted to the EEG with diverse formats. CBraMod is pre-trained on a very large corpus of EEG through patch-based masked EEG reconstruction. We evaluate CBraMod on up to 10 downstream BCI tasks (12 public datasets). CBraMod achieves the state-of-the-art performance across the wide range of tasks, proving its strong capability and generalizability.

| **[How do Transformers Learn Implicit Reasoning?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23653v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work suggests that large language models (LLMs) can perform multi-hop reasoning implicitly -- producing correct answers without explicitly verbalizing intermediate steps -- but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this paper, we study how such implicit reasoning emerges by training transformers from scratch in a controlled symbolic environment. Our analysis reveals a three-stage developmental trajectory: early memorization, followed by in-distribution generalization, and eventually cross-distribution generalization. We find that training with atomic triples is not necessary but accelerates learning, and that second-hop generalization relies on query-level exposure to specific compositional structures. To interpret these behaviors, we introduce two diagnostic tools: cross-query semantic patching, which identifies semantically reusable intermediate representations, and a cosine-based representational lens, which reveals that successful reasoning correlates with the cosine-base clustering in hidden space. This clustering phenomenon in turn provides a coherent explanation for the behavioral dynamics observed across training, linking representational structure to reasoning capability. These findings provide new insights into the interpretability of implicit multi-hop reasoning in LLMs, helping to clarify how complex reasoning processes unfold internally and offering pathways to enhance the transparency of such models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as Spotlight at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Differentially Private In-Context Learning with Nearest Neighbor Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04332v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentially private in-context learning (DP-ICL) has recently become an active research topic due to the inherent privacy risks of in-context learning. However, existing approaches overlook a critical component of modern large language model (LLM) pipelines: the similarity search used to retrieve relevant context data. In this work, we introduce a DP framework for in-context learning that integrates nearest neighbor search of relevant examples in a privacy-aware manner. Our method outperforms existing baselines by a substantial margin across all evaluated benchmarks, achieving more favorable privacy-utility trade-offs. To achieve this, we employ nearest neighbor retrieval from a database of context data, combined with a privacy filter that tracks the cumulative privacy cost of selected samples to ensure adherence to a central differential privacy budget. Experimental results on text classification and document question answering show a clear advantage of the proposed method over existing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS Lock-LLM Workshop 2025</p></details> |

However, research on their medication safety remains limited due to the lack of real world datasets, constrained by privacy and accessibility issues. Moreover, evaluation of LLMs in realistic clinical consultation settings, particularly regarding medication safety, is still underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose a framework that simulates and evaluates clinical consultations to systematically assess the medication safety capabilities of LLMs. Within this framework, we generate inquiry diagnosis dialogues with embedded medication risks and construct a dedicated medication safety database, RxRisk DB, containing 6,725 contraindications, 28,781 drug interactions, and 14,906 indication-drug pairs. A two-stage filtering strategy ensures clinical realism and professional quality, resulting in the benchmark RxSafeBench with 2,443 high-quality consultation scenarios. We evaluate leading open-source and proprietary LLMs using structured multiple choice questions that test their ability to recommend safe medications under simulated patient contexts. Results show that current LLMs struggle to integrate contraindication and interaction knowledge, especially when risks are implied rather than explicit. Our findings highlight key challenges in ensuring medication safety in LLM-based systems and provide insights into improving reliability through better prompting and task-specific tuning. RxSafeBench offers the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating medication safety in LLMs, advancing safer and more trustworthy AI-driven clinical decision support.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in BIBM2025</p></details> |
| **[Cross-modal Causal Intervention for Alzheimer's Disease Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13956v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) serves as a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), where early identification and intervention can effectively slow the progression to dementia. However, diagnosing AD remains a significant challenge in neurology due to the confounders caused mainly by the selection bias of multi-modal data and the complex relationships between variables. To address these issues, we propose a novel visual-language causality-inspired framework named Cross-modal Causal Intervention with Mediator for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis (MediAD) for diagnostic assistance. Our MediAD employs Large Language Models (LLMs) to summarize clinical data under strict templates, therefore enriching textual inputs. The MediAD model utilizes Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), clinical data, and textual data enriched by LLMs to classify participants into Cognitively Normal (CN), MCI, and AD categories. Because of the presence of confounders, such as cerebral vascular lesions and age-related biomarkers, non-causal models are likely to capture spurious input-output correlations, generating less reliable results. Our framework implicitly mitigates the effect of both observable and unobservable confounders through a unified causal intervention method. Experimental results demonstrate the outstanding performance of our method in distinguishing CN/MCI/AD cases, outperforming other methods in most evaluation metrics. The study showcases the potential of integrating causal reasoning with multi-modal learning for neurological disease diagnosis.</p></details> |  |

This fragmentation makes reproducibility and comparability across studies challenging, hindering meaningful progress. To address these issues, we introduce AdversariaLLM, a toolbox for conducting LLM jailbreak robustness research. Its design centers on reproducibility, correctness, and extensibility. The framework implements twelve adversarial attack algorithms, integrates seven benchmark datasets spanning harmfulness, over-refusal, and utility evaluation, and provides access to a wide range of open-weight LLMs via Hugging Face. The implementation includes advanced features for comparability and reproducibility such as compute-resource tracking, deterministic results, and distributional evaluation techniques. \name also integrates judging through the companion package JudgeZoo, which can also be used independently. Together, these components aim to establish a robust foundation for transparent, comparable, and reproducible research in LLM safety.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test-Time Warmup for Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10641v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold great promise for advanced reasoning at the intersection of text and images, yet they have not fully realized this potential. MLLMs typically integrate an LLM, a vision encoder, and a connector that maps the vision encoder's embeddings into the LLM's text embedding space. Although each component is pretrained on massive datasets with billions of samples, the entire multimodal model is typically trained on only thousands (or a few million) samples, which can result in weak performance on complex reasoning tasks. To address these shortcomings, instead of relying on extensive labeled datasets for fine-tuning, we propose a Test-Time Warmup method that adapts the MLLM per test instance by leveraging data from weakly supervised auxiliary tasks. With our approach, we observe a relative performance improvement of 4.03% on MMMU, 5.28% on VQA-Rad, and 1.63% on GQA on the Llama-Vision-Instruct model. Our method demonstrates that 'warming up' before inference can enhance MLLMs' robustness across diverse reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces TathyaNyaya, the largest annotated dataset for FJPE tailored to the Indian legal context, encompassing judgments from the Supreme Court of India and various High Courts. Derived from the Hindi terms "Tathya" (fact) and "Nyaya" (justice), the TathyaNyaya dataset is uniquely designed to focus on factual statements rather than complete legal texts, reflecting real-world judicial processes where factual data drives outcomes. Complementing this dataset, we present FactLegalLlama, an instruction-tuned variant of the LLaMa-3-8B Large Language Model (LLM), optimized for generating high-quality explanations in FJPE tasks. Finetuned on the factual data in TathyaNyaya, FactLegalLlama integrates predictive accuracy with coherent, contextually relevant explanations, addressing the critical need for transparency and interpretability in AI-assisted legal systems. Our methodology combines transformers for binary judgment prediction with FactLegalLlama for explanation generation, creating a robust framework for advancing FJPE in the Indian legal domain. TathyaNyaya not only surpasses existing datasets in scale and diversity but also establishes a benchmark for building explainable AI systems in legal analysis. The findings underscore the importance of factual precision and domain-specific tuning in enhancing predictive performance and interpretability, positioning TathyaNyaya and FactLegalLlama as foundational resources for AI-assisted legal decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted in the AACL-IJCNLP 2025 conference</p></details> |
| **[Pragmatic Reasoning improves LLM Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15835v3)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive potential in translating natural language (NL) instructions into program code. However, user instructions often contain inherent ambiguities, making it challenging for LLMs to generate code that accurately reflects the user's true intent. To address this challenge, researchers have proposed approaches that produce multiple candidates of the program code and then rerank them to identify the best solution. In this paper, we propose CodeRSA, a novel code candidate reranking mechanism built upon the Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework, designed to guide LLMs toward more comprehensive pragmatic reasoning about user intent. We evaluate CodeRSA using Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct on two widely used code generation benchmarks, HumanEval and MBPP. Our experiment results show that CodeRSA consistently outperforms common baselines, surpasses the state-of-the-art approach in most cases, and demonstrates robust overall performance. These findings underscore the effectiveness of integrating pragmatic reasoning into code candidate reranking, offering a promising direction for enhancing code generation quality in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[ThunderServe: High-performance and Cost-efficient LLM Serving in Cloud Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09334v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their remarkable proficiency in a range of tasks. Compared to in-house homogeneous GPU clusters, deploying LLMs in cloud environments with diverse types of GPUs is crucial for addressing the GPU shortage problem and being more cost-effective. However, the diversity of network environments and various GPU types on the cloud bring difficulties to achieving high-performance serving. In this work, we propose ThunderServe, a high-performance and cost-efficient LLM serving system for heterogeneous cloud environments. We introduce a novel scheduling algorithm, which optimizes the deployment plan of LLM serving to accommodate the heterogeneous resource and network bandwidth conditions in cloud environments. Furthermore, we propose a lightweight re-scheduling mechanism, designed to adapt to fluctuating online conditions (e.g., node failures, workload shifts) without the need for costly restarts of ongoing services. Empirical results in both heterogeneous cloud and homogeneous in-house environments reveal that ThunderServe delivers up to a 2.1$\times$ and on average a $1.7\times$ increase in throughput and achieves up to a 2.5$\times$ and on average a $1.5\times$ reduction in latency deadlines compared with state-of-the-art systems given the same price budget, suggesting opting for cloud services provides a more cost-efficient solution.</p></details> | MLSys 2025 |

Most existing CTG studies relied on domain-specific models and lack systematic comparisons with modern foundation or language models, limiting our understanding of whether these models can outperform specialized systems in fetal health assessment. In this study, we present the first comprehensive benchmark of state-of-the-art architectures for automated antepartum CTG classification. Over 2,500 20-minutes recordings were used to evaluate over 15 models spanning domain-specific, time-series, foundation, and language-model categories under a unified framework. Fine-tuned LLMs consistently outperformed both foundation and domain-specific models across data-availability scenarios, except when uterine-activity signals were absent, where domain-specific models showed greater robustness. These performance gains, however, required substantially higher computational resources. Our results highlight that while fine-tuned LLMs achieved state-of-the-art performance for CTG classification, practical deployment must balance performance with computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepa...</summary><p>Preparing for journal</p></details> |
| **[But what is your honest answer? Aiding LLM-judges with honest alternatives using steering vectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17760v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting subtle forms of dishonesty like sycophancy and manipulation in Large Language Models (LLMs) remains challenging for both humans and automated evaluators, as these behaviors often appear through small biases rather than clear false statements. We introduce Judge Using Safety-Steered Alternatives (JUSSA), a novel framework that employs steering vectors not to improve model behavior directly, but to enhance LLM judges' evaluation capabilities. JUSSA applies steering vectors during inference to generate more honest alternatives, providing judges with contrastive examples that make subtle dishonest patterns easier to detect. While existing evaluation methods rely on black-box evaluation, JUSSA leverages model internals to create targeted comparisons from single examples. We evaluate our method on sycophancy detection and introduce a new manipulation dataset covering multiple types of manipulation. Our results demonstrate that JUSSA effectively improves detection accuracy over single-response evaluation in various cases. Analysis across judge models reveals that JUSSA helps weaker judges on easier dishonesty detection tasks, and stronger judges on harder tasks. Layer-wise experiments show how dishonest prompts cause representations to diverge from honest ones in middle layers, revealing where steering interventions are most effective for generating contrastive examples. By demonstrating that steering vectors can enhance safety evaluation rather than just modify behavior, our work opens new directions for scalable model auditing as systems become increasingly sophisticated.</p></details> |  |

While large language models (LLMs) can offer promising support in this task, their reliability remains limited, particularly for critical reasoning in specialized domains. We introduce CareMedEval, an original dataset designed to evaluate LLMs on biomedical critical appraisal and reasoning tasks. Derived from authentic exams taken by French medical students, the dataset contains 534 questions based on 37 scientific articles. Unlike existing benchmarks, CareMedEval explicitly evaluates critical reading and reasoning grounded in scientific papers. Benchmarking state-of-the-art generalist and biomedical-specialized LLMs under various context conditions reveals the difficulty of the task: open and commercial models fail to exceed an Exact Match Rate of 0.5 even though generating intermediate reasoning tokens considerably improves the results. Yet, models remain challenged especially on questions about study limitations and statistical analysis. CareMedEval provides a challenging benchmark for grounded reasoning, exposing current LLM limitations and paving the way for future development of automated support for critical appraisal.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to LREC 2026 (under review) To access the dataset, see https://github.com/bonzid/CareMedEval</p></details> |
| **[A Tool for Benchmarking Large Language Models' Robustness in Assessing the Realism of Driving Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04267v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, autonomous driving systems have made significant progress, yet ensuring their safety remains a key challenge. To this end, scenario-based testing offers a practical solution, and simulation-based methods have gained traction due to the high cost and risk of real-world testing. However, evaluating the realism of simulated scenarios remains difficult, creating demand for effective assessment methods. Recent advances show that Large Language Models (LLMs) possess strong reasoning and generalization capabilities, suggesting their potential in assessing scenario realism through scenario-related textual prompts. Motivated by this, we propose DriveRLR, a benchmark tool to assess the robustness of LLMs in evaluating the realism of driving scenarios. DriveRLR generates mutated scenario variants, constructs prompts, which are then used to assess a given LLM's ability and robustness in determining the realism of driving scenarios. We validate DriveRLR on the DeepScenario dataset using three state-of-the-art LLMs: GPT-5, Llama 4 Maverick, and Mistral Small 3.2. Results show that DriveRLR effectively reveals differences in the robustness of various LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness and practical value in scenario realism assessment. Beyond LLM robustness evaluation, DriveRLR can serve as a practical component in applications such as an objective function to guide scenario generation, supporting simulation-based ADS testing workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Graph Neural Networks for Healthcare](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02531v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Healthcare artificial intelligence systems routinely fail when deployed across institutions, with documented performance drops and perpetuation of discriminatory patterns embedded in historical data. This brittleness stems, in part, from learning statistical associations rather than causal mechanisms. Causal graph neural networks address this triple crisis of distribution shift, discrimination, and inscrutability by combining graph-based representations of biomedical data with causal inference principles to learn invariant mechanisms rather than spurious correlations. This Review examines methodological foundations spanning structural causal models, disentangled causal representation learning, and techniques for interventional prediction and counterfactual reasoning on graphs. We analyse applications demonstrating clinical value across psychiatric diagnosis through brain network analysis, cancer subtyping via multi-omics causal integration, continuous physiological monitoring with mechanistic interpretation, and drug recommendation correcting prescription bias. These advances establish foundations for patient-specific Causal Digital Twins, enabling in silico clinical experimentation, with integration of large language models for hypothesis generation and causal graph neural networks for mechanistic validation. Substantial barriers remain, including computational requirements precluding real-time deployment, validation challenges demanding multi-modal evidence triangulation beyond cross-validation, and risks of causal-washing where methods employ causal terminology without rigorous evidentiary support. We propose tiered frameworks distinguishing causally-inspired architectures from causally-validated discoveries and identify critical research priorities making causal rather than purely associational claims.</p></details> |  |
| **[SSPO: Subsentence-level Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04256v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a significant part of post-training of the Large Language Models (LLMs), Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has greatly improved LLMs' reasoning skills. However, some RLVR algorithms, such as GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) and GSPO (Group Sequence Policy Optimization), are observed to suffer from unstable policy updates and low usage of sampling data, respectively. The importance ratio of GRPO is calculated at the token level, which focuses more on optimizing a single token. This will be easily affected by outliers, leading to model training collapse. GSPO proposed the calculation of the response level importance ratio, which solves the problem of high variance and training noise accumulation in the calculation of the GRPO importance ratio. However, since all the response tokens share a common importance ratio, extreme values can easily raise or lower the overall mean, leading to the entire response being mistakenly discarded, resulting in a decrease in the utilization of sampled data. This paper introduces SSPO, which applies sentence-level importance ratio, taking the balance between GRPO and GSPO. SSPO not only avoids training collapse and high variance, but also prevents the whole response tokens from being abandoned by the clipping mechanism. Furthermore, we apply sentence entropy to PPO-CLIP to steadily adjust the clipping bounds, encouraging high-entropy tokens to explore and narrow the clipping range of low-entropy tokens. In particular, SSPO achieves an average score of 46.57 across five datasets, surpassing GRPO (43.01) and GSPO (44.42), and wins state-of-the-art performance on three datasets. These results highlight SSPO's effectiveness in leveraging generated data by taking the essence of GSPO but rejecting its shortcomings.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we use retrieval augmented generation along with test-time compute as a way to quantify how much dataset value was left behind by the process of pre-training, and how this changes across scale. We demonstrate that pre-training then retrieving from standard and largely open-sourced datasets results in significant accuracy gains in MMLU, Math-500, and SimpleQA, which persist through decontamination. For MMLU we observe that retrieval acts as a ~5x compute multiplier versus pre-training alone. We show that these results can be further improved by leveraging additional compute at test time to parse the retrieved context, demonstrating a 10 percentage point improvement on MMLU for the public LLaMA 3.1 8B model. Overall, our results suggest that today's pre-training methods do not make full use of the information in existing pre-training datasets, leaving significant room for progress.</p></details> |  |

However, as large language model compute budgets continue to grow, the limited data volume provided by heavily filtered and deduplicated datasets will become a practical constraint. In efforts to better understand how to proceed, we study model performance at various compute budgets and across multiple pre-training datasets created through data filtering and deduplication. We find that, given appropriate modifications to the training recipe, repeating existing aggressively filtered datasets for up to ten epochs can outperform training on the ten times larger superset for a single epoch across multiple compute budget orders of magnitude. While this finding relies on repeating the dataset for many epochs, we also investigate repeats within these datasets at the document level. We find that not all documents within a dataset are equal, and we can create better datasets relative to a token budget by explicitly manipulating the counts of individual documents. We conclude by arguing that even as large language models scale, data filtering remains an important direction of research.</p></details> |  |

We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can act as in-context meta-learners for this task. By converting each dataset into interpretable metadata, we prompt an LLM to recommend both model families and hyperparameters. We study two prompting strategies: (1) a zero-shot mode relying solely on pretrained knowledge, and (2) a meta-informed mode augmented with examples of models and their performance on past tasks. Across synthetic and real-world benchmarks, we show that LLMs can exploit dataset metadata to recommend competitive models and hyperparameters without search, and that improvements from meta-informed prompting demonstrate their capacity for in-context meta-learning. These results highlight a promising new role for LLMs as lightweight, general-purpose assistants for model selection and hyperparameter optimization.</p></details> | 27 pages, 6 figures |

However, in real-world LLM serving scenarios, significant fluctuations in request input/output lengths lead to imbalanced computational loads between prefill and decode nodes under traditional static node allocation strategies, consequently preventing efficient utilization of computing resources to improve the system's goodput. To address this challenge, we design and implement Arrow, an adaptive scheduler that leverages stateless instances and latency characteristics of prefill and decode tasks to achieve efficient adaptive request and instance scheduling. Arrow dynamically adjusts the number of instances handling prefill and decode tasks based on real-time cluster performance metrics, substantially enhancing the system's capability to handle traffic spikes and load variations. Our evaluation under diverse real-world workloads shows that Arrow achieves up to $2.55 \times$ higher request serving rates compared to state-of-the-art Prefill-Decode disaggregated serving systems.</p></details> |  |

Uniform task sampling is inefficient, wasting computation on tasks that are either trivial or unsolvable, while existing task selection methods often suffer from high rollout costs, poor adaptivity, or incomplete evidence. We introduce BOTS, a unified framework for Bayesian Online Task Selection in LLM reinforcement finetuning. Grounded in Bayesian inference, BOTS adaptively maintains posterior estimates of task difficulty as the model evolves. It jointly incorporates explicit evidence from direct evaluations of selected tasks and implicit evidence inferred from these evaluations for unselected tasks, with Thompson sampling ensuring a principled balance between exploration and exploitation. To make implicit evidence practical, we instantiate it with an ultra-light interpolation-based plug-in that estimates difficulties of unevaluated tasks without extra rollouts, adding negligible overhead. Empirically, across diverse domains and LLM scales, BOTS consistently improves data efficiency and performance over baselines and ablations, providing a practical and extensible solution for dynamic task selection in RFT.</p></details> |  |

While effective at mitigating harmful responses, these guardrails introduce a new class of vulnerabilities by exposing observable decision patterns. In this work, we present the first study of black-box LLM guardrail reverse-engineering attacks. We propose Guardrail Reverse-engineering Attack (GRA), a reinforcement learning-based framework that leverages genetic algorithm-driven data augmentation to approximate the decision-making policy of victim guardrails. By iteratively collecting input-output pairs, prioritizing divergence cases, and applying targeted mutations and crossovers, our method incrementally converges toward a high-fidelity surrogate of the victim guardrail. We evaluate GRA on three widely deployed commercial systems, namely ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Qwen3, and demonstrate that it achieves an rule matching rate exceeding 0.92 while requiring less than $85 in API costs. These findings underscore the practical feasibility of guardrail extraction and highlight significant security risks for current LLM safety mechanisms. Our findings expose critical vulnerabilities in current guardrail designs and highlight the urgent need for more robust defense mechanisms in LLM deployment.</p></details> |  |

In this paper we report a theorem proving feat achieved by ChatGPT by using a protocol involving different prover and verifier instances of the gpt-5 model working collaboratively. To make sure that the produced proofs do not suffer from hallucinations, the final proof is formally verified by the lean proof assistant, and the conformance of premises and conclusion of the lean code is verified by a human. Our methodology is by no means complete or exact. It was nonetheless able to solve five out of six 2025 IMO problems, and close about a third of the sixty-six number theory conjectures in [Cohen, Journal of Integer Sequences, 2025].</p></details> |  |

Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution for efficient deployment, yet achieving accurate W4A4 quantization remains an open challenge. While most existing methods are designed for INT4 formats, the emergence of MXFP4 -- a new FP4 format with various hardware support (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel)-- raises questions about the applicability of current techniques. In this work, we establish a comprehensive benchmark of PTQ methods under the MXFP4 format. Through systematic evaluation, we find that methods like GPTQ consistently deliver strong performance, whereas rotation-based approaches, which are almost used by all state-of-the-art approaches, suffer from severe incompatibility with MXFP4. We further provide the first in-depth analysis of this conflict, tracing its root to a fundamental mismatch between MXFP4's PoT (power-of-two) block scaling and the redistribution of outlier energy via global rotation. Building on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective block rotation strategy that adapts rotation-based methods to MXFP4, leading to substantial accuracy improvements across diverse LLMs. Our findings not only offer clear guidance for practitioners but also set a foundation for advancing PTQ research under emerging low-precision formats.</p></details> | 9 pages, 10 figures |

However, existing approaches struggle to effectively utilize complex radiology reports for learning and offer limited interpretability through attention probability visualizations. To address these challenges, we introduce $\textbf{RadZero}$, a novel framework for VL alignment in chest X-ray with zero-shot multi-task capability. A key component of our approach is $\textbf{VL-CABS}$ ($\textbf{V}$ision-$\textbf{L}$anguage $\textbf{C}$ross-$\textbf{A}$ttention $\textbf{B}$ased on $\textbf{S}$imilarity), which aligns text embeddings with local image features for interpretable, fine-grained VL reasoning. RadZero leverages large language models to extract concise semantic sentences from radiology reports and employs multi-positive contrastive training to effectively capture relationships between images and multiple relevant textual descriptions. It uses a pre-trained vision encoder with additional trainable Transformer layers, allowing efficient high-resolution image processing. By computing similarity between text embeddings and local image patch features, VL-CABS enables zero-shot inference with similarity probability for classification, and pixel-level VL similarity maps for grounding and segmentation. Experimental results on public chest radiograph benchmarks show that RadZero outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot classification, grounding, and segmentation. Furthermore, VL similarity map analysis highlights the potential of VL-CABS for improving explainability in VL alignment. Additionally, qualitative evaluation demonstrates RadZero's capability for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, further validating its effectiveness in medical imaging.

To overcome this limitation, one potential technical solution is to utilize large language models (LLMs). For an exploratory study using a new platform connected with LLMs, we conducted a LLM-corrected mock exam during the "Introduction to Statistics" lecture at the University of Munich (Germany). The online platform allows instructors to upload exercises along with the correct solutions. Students complete these exercises and receive overall feedback on their results, as well as individualized feedback generated by GPT-4 based on the correct answers provided by the lecturers. The resulting dataset comprised task-level information for all participating students, including individual responses and the corresponding LLM-generated feedback. Our systematic analysis revealed that approximately 7 \% of the 2,389 feedback instances contained errors, ranging from minor technical inaccuracies to conceptually misleading explanations. Further, using a combined feedback framework approach, we found that the feedback predominantly focused on explaining why an answer was correct or incorrect, with fewer instances providing deeper conceptual insights, learning strategies or self-regulatory advice. These findings highlight both the potential and the limitations of deploying LLMs as scalable feedback tools in higher education, emphasizing the need for careful quality monitoring and prompt design to maximize their pedagogical value.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, current RL methods face a fundamental scalability bottleneck due to their heavy reliance on human-curated preference data or labeled datasets for reward modeling. To overcome this limitation, we explore RL on unlabeled data where models learn autonomously from continuous experience streams. The core challenge in this setting lies in reliable reward estimation without ground-truth supervision. Existing approaches like Test-Time RL address this through self-consistent consensus, but risk reinforcing incorrect pseudo-labels derived from majority voting. We introduce COMPASS (Composite Path and Answer Self-Scoring), a novel test-time reward mechanism that operates without external supervision. COMPASS integrates two complementary components: the Dual-Calibration Answer Reward (DCAR), which stabilizes training by establishing trustworthy pseudo-labels through confidence and credibility calibration, and the Decisive Path Reward (DPR), which directly optimizes the reasoning process quality beyond mere outcome supervision. By jointly reinforcing trustworthy consensus answers and highly decisive reasoning chains, the COMPASS systematically enhances the model's analytical capabilities. Extensive experiments show that COMPASS achieves significant and consistent performance gains across diverse reasoning tasks and model architectures, advancing a more scalable direction for LLMs to learn from continuous experience.</p></details> |  |

The authors examine two related ideas: using LLM as actual exam candidates and applying the 'LLM-as-a-judge' approach, in which model-generated answers are automatically evaluated by other models. The paper describes the structure of the exam, which includes a multiple-choice knowledge test on public procurement law and a written judgment, and presents the hybrid information recovery and extraction pipeline built to support the models. Several LLMs (including GPT-4.1, Claude 4 Sonnet and Bielik-11B-v2.6) were tested in closed-book and various Retrieval-Augmented Generation settings. The results show that although the models achieved satisfactory scores in the knowledge test, none met the passing threshold in the practical written part, and the evaluations of the 'LLM-as-a-judge' often diverged from the judgments of the official examining committee. The authors highlight key limitations: susceptibility to hallucinations, incorrect citation of legal provisions, weaknesses in logical argumentation, and the need for close collaboration between legal experts and technical teams. The findings indicate that, despite rapid technological progress, current LLMs cannot yet replace human judges or independent examiners in Polish public procurement adjudication.</p></details> |  |

However, our empirical analysis reveals a critical drawback: reasoning-oriented RL fine-tuning significantly increases the prevalence of hallucinations. We theoretically analyze the RL training dynamics, identifying high-variance gradient, entropy-induced randomness, and susceptibility to spurious local optima as key factors leading to hallucinations. To address this drawback, we propose Factuality-aware Step-wise Policy Optimization (FSPO), an innovative RL fine-tuning algorithm incorporating explicit factuality verification at each reasoning step. FSPO leverages automated verification against given evidence to dynamically adjust token-level advantage values, incentivizing factual correctness throughout the reasoning process. Experiments across mathematical reasoning and hallucination benchmarks using Qwen2.5 and Llama models demonstrate that FSPO effectively reduces hallucinations while enhancing reasoning accuracy, substantially improving both reliability and performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Computational Turing Test Reveals Systematic Differences Between Human and AI Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04195v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in the social sciences to simulate human behavior, based on the assumption that they can generate realistic, human-like text. Yet this assumption remains largely untested. Existing validation efforts rely heavily on human-judgment-based evaluations -- testing whether humans can distinguish AI from human output -- despite evidence that such judgments are blunt and unreliable. As a result, the field lacks robust tools for assessing the realism of LLM-generated text or for calibrating models to real-world data. This paper makes two contributions. First, we introduce a computational Turing test: a validation framework that integrates aggregate metrics (BERT-based detectability and semantic similarity) with interpretable linguistic features (stylistic markers and topical patterns) to assess how closely LLMs approximate human language within a given dataset. Second, we systematically compare nine open-weight LLMs across five calibration strategies -- including fine-tuning, stylistic prompting, and context retrieval -- benchmarking their ability to reproduce user interactions on X (formerly Twitter), Bluesky, and Reddit. Our findings challenge core assumptions in the literature. Even after calibration, LLM outputs remain clearly distinguishable from human text, particularly in affective tone and emotional expression. Instruction-tuned models underperform their base counterparts, and scaling up model size does not enhance human-likeness. Crucially, we identify a trade-off: optimizing for human-likeness often comes at the cost of semantic fidelity, and vice versa. These results provide a much-needed scalable framework for validation and calibration in LLM simulations -- and offer a cautionary note about their current limitations in capturing human communication.</p></details> |  |

To solve this, we introduce a decomposed prompting approach for sequence labeling tasks. Diverging from the single text-to-text prompt, our prompt method generates for each token of the input sentence an individual prompt which asks for its linguistic label. We test our method on the Universal Dependencies part-of-speech tagging dataset for 38 languages, using both English-centric and multilingual LLMs. Our findings show that decomposed prompting surpasses the iterative prompting baseline in efficacy and efficiency under zero- and few-shot settings. Moreover, our analysis of multilingual performance of English-centric LLMs yields insights into the transferability of linguistic knowledge via multilingual prompting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AACL-IJCNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |

Nevertheless, these tools frequently exhibit usability limitations, as their generic warning messages do not sufficiently communicate important information to developers, resulting in misunderstandings or oversight of critical findings. In light of recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their text generation capabilities, our work investigates a hybrid approach that uses LLMs to tackle the SAST explainability challenges. In this paper, we present SAFE, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) plugin that leverages GPT-4o to explain the causes, impacts, and mitigation strategies of vulnerabilities detected by SAST tools. Our expert user study findings indicate that the explanations generated by SAFE can significantly assist beginner to intermediate developers in understanding and addressing security vulnerabilities, thereby improving the overall usability of SAST tools.</p></details> |  |

Digital tools exist, but there is a serious lack of customized coaching for newcomers. This paper presents an AI-powered chatbot that will serve as a mentor for the students of BRAC University. The main component is a data ingestion pipeline that efficiently processes and updates information from diverse sources, such as CSV files and university webpages. The chatbot retrieves information through a hybrid approach, combining BM25 lexical ranking with ChromaDB semantic retrieval, and uses a Large Language Model, LLaMA-3.3-70B, to generate conversational responses. The generated text was found to be semantically highly relevant, with a BERTScore of 0.831 and a METEOR score of 0.809. The data pipeline was also very efficient, taking 106.82 seconds for updates, compared to 368.62 seconds for new data. This chatbot will be able to help students by responding to their queries, helping them to get a better understanding of university life, and assisting them to plan better routines for their semester in the open-credit university.</p></details> | 11 pages |

As in the previous editions, participants were challenged to develop systems that identify mentions and cluster them according to identity coreference. A key innovation of this year's task was the introduction of a dedicated Large Language Model (LLM) track, featuring a simplified plaintext format designed to be more suitable for LLMs than the original CoNLL-U representation. The task also expanded its coverage with three new datasets in two additional languages, using version 1.3 of CorefUD - a harmonized multilingual collection of 22 datasets in 17 languages. In total, nine systems participated, including four LLM-based approaches (two fine-tuned and two using few-shot adaptation). While traditional systems still kept the lead, LLMs showed clear potential, suggesting they may soon challenge established approaches in future editions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CODI-CRAC 2025</p></details> |

However, ensuring the robustness of LLMs remains a critical challenge. To address these challenges and advance the field, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of current studies in this area. First, we systematically examine the nature of robustness in LLMs, including its conceptual foundations, the importance of consistent performance across diverse inputs, and the implications of failure modes in real-world applications. Next, we analyze the sources of non-robustness, categorizing intrinsic model limitations, data-driven vulnerabilities, and external adversarial factors that compromise reliability. Following this, we review state-of-the-art mitigation strategies, and then we discuss widely adopted benchmarks, emerging metrics, and persistent gaps in assessing real-world reliability. Finally, we synthesize findings from existing surveys and interdisciplinary studies to highlight trends, unresolved issues, and pathways for future research.</p></details> | Accepted at TMLR |
| **[Are We Aligned? A Preliminary Investigation of the Alignment of Responsible AI Values between LLMs and Human Judgment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04157v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in software engineering tasks such as requirements elicitation, design, and evaluation, raising critical questions regarding their alignment with human judgments on responsible AI values. This study investigates how closely LLMs' value preferences align with those of two human groups: a US-representative sample and AI practitioners. We evaluate 23 LLMs across four tasks: (T1) selecting key responsible AI values, (T2) rating their importance in specific contexts, (T3) resolving trade-offs between competing values, and (T4) prioritizing software requirements that embody those values. The results show that LLMs generally align more closely with AI practitioners than with the US-representative sample, emphasizing fairness, privacy, transparency, safety, and accountability. However, inconsistencies appear between the values that LLMs claim to uphold (Tasks 1-3) and the way they prioritize requirements (Task 4), revealing gaps in faithfulness between stated and applied behavior. These findings highlight the practical risk of relying on LLMs in requirements engineering without human oversight and motivate the need for systematic approaches to benchmark, interpret, and monitor value alignment in AI-assisted software development.</p></details> |  |

However, existing Large Language Models (LLM) struggle with SQL generation from natural instructions due to large schema sizes and complex reasoning. Prior work often focuses on complex, somewhat impractical pipelines using flagship models, while smaller, efficient models remain overlooked. In this work, we explore three multi-agent LLM pipelines, with systematic performance benchmarking across a range of small to large open-source models: (1) Multi-agent discussion pipeline, where agents iteratively critique and refine SQL queries, and a judge synthesizes the final answer; (2) Planner-Coder pipeline, where a thinking model planner generates stepwise SQL generation plans and a coder synthesizes queries; and (3) Coder-Aggregator pipeline, where multiple coders independently generate SQL queries, and a reasoning agent selects the best query. Experiments on the Bird-Bench Mini-Dev set reveal that Multi-Agent discussion can improve small model performance, with up to 10.6% increase in Execution Accuracy for Qwen2.5-7b-Instruct seen after three rounds of discussion. Among the pipelines, the LLM Reasoner-Coder pipeline yields the best results, with DeepSeek-R1-32B and QwQ-32B planners boosting Gemma 3 27B IT accuracy from 52.4% to the highest score of 56.4%.

Given suitable medical articles, doctors effectively reduce the incidence of misdiagnoses. Researchers find it efficient to use large language models (LLMs) techniques like RAG for EBM tasks. However, the EBM maintains stringent requirements for evidence, and RAG applications in EBM struggle to efficiently distinguish high-quality evidence. Therefore, inspired by the meta-analysis used in EBM, we provide a new method to re-rank and filter the medical evidence. This method presents multiple principles to filter the best evidence for LLMs to diagnose. We employ a combination of several EBM methods to emulate the meta-analysis, which includes reliability analysis, heterogeneity analysis, and extrapolation analysis. These processes allow the users to retrieve the best medical evidence for the LLMs. Ultimately, we evaluate these high-quality articles and show an accuracy improvement of up to 11.4% in our experiments and results. Our method successfully enables RAG to extract higher-quality and more reliable evidence from the PubMed dataset. This work can reduce the infusion of incorrect knowledge into responses and help users receive more effective replies.</p></details> |  |

The framework is grounded in three key insights from prior jailbreaking research and practice: ensemble approaches outperform single methods in exposing aligned LLM vulnerabilities, malicious instructions vary in jailbreaking difficulty requiring tailored optimization, and disrupting semantic coherence of malicious prompts can manipulate their embeddings to boost success rates. Validated in the Competition for LLM and Agent Safety 2024, our solution achieved top rankings in the Jailbreaking Attack Track.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose and analyze the implementation of the transformer model, which is the cornerstone of the modern LLMs, with novel large-scale optoelectronic neurons (OENs) constructed over the commercially available complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor (CIS) platform. With all of the required optoelectronic devices and electronic circuits integrated in a chiplet only about 2 cm by 3 cm in size, 175 billon parameters in the case of GPT-3 are shown to perform inference at an unprecedented speed of 12.6 POPS using only a 40 nm CMOS process node, along with a high power efficiency of 74 TOPS/W and a high area efficiency of 19 TOPS/mm2, both surpassing the related digital electronics by roughly two orders of magnitude. The influence of the quantization formats and the hardware induced errors are numerically investigated, and are shown to have a minimal impact. Our study presents a new yet practical path toward analog neural processing units (NPUs) to complement existing digital processing units.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probe-Rewrite-Evaluate: A Workflow for Reliable Benchmarks and Quantifying Evaluation Awareness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00591v6)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit significant behavioral shifts when they perceive a change from a real-world deployment context to a controlled evaluation setting, a phenomenon known as "evaluation awareness." This discrepancy poses a critical challenge for AI alignment, as benchmark performance may not accurately reflect a model's true safety and honesty. In this work, we systematically quantify these behavioral changes by manipulating the perceived context of prompts. We introduce a methodology that uses a linear probe to score prompts on a continuous scale from "test-like" to "deploy-like" and leverage an LLM rewriting strategy to shift these prompts towards a more natural, deployment-style context while preserving the original task. Using this method, we achieved a 30% increase in the average probe score across a strategic role-playing dataset after rewriting. Evaluating a suite of state-of-the-art models on these original and rewritten prompts, we find that rewritten "deploy-like" prompts induce a significant and consistent shift in behavior. Across all models, we observed an average increase in honest responses of 5.26% and a corresponding average decrease in deceptive responses of 12.40%. Furthermore, refusal rates increased by an average of 6.38%, indicating heightened safety compliance. Our findings demonstrate that evaluation awareness is a quantifiable and manipulable factor that directly influences LLM behavior, revealing that models are more prone to unsafe or deceptive outputs in perceived test environments. This underscores the urgent need for more realistic evaluation frameworks to accurately gauge true model alignment before deployment.</p></details> |  |

As critical system software and infrastructure, compilers are responsible for transforming source code into target code. While LLMs have been leveraged to assist in compiler development and maintenance, their potential as an end-to-end compiler remains largely unexplored. This paper explores the feasibility of LLM as a Compiler (LaaC) and its future directions. We designed the CompilerEval dataset and framework specifically to evaluate the capabilities of mainstream LLMs in source code comprehension and assembly code generation. In the evaluation, we analyzed various errors, explored multiple methods to improve LLM-generated code, and evaluated cross-platform compilation capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMs exhibit basic capabilities as compilers but currently achieve low compilation success rates. By optimizing prompts, scaling up the model, and incorporating reasoning methods, the quality of assembly code generated by LLMs can be significantly enhanced. Based on these findings, we maintain an optimistic outlook for LaaC and propose practical architectural designs and future research directions. We believe that with targeted training, knowledge-rich prompts, and specialized infrastructure, LaaC has the potential to generate high-quality assembly code and drive a paradigm shift in the field of compilation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted by IJCNN 2025 and submitted to the IEEE for publication</p></details> |

To this end, an adversarial perturbation-based evaluation is needed to measure true mathematical reasoning ability. Current rule-based perturbation methods often generate ill-posed questions and impede the systematic evaluation of question difficulty and the evolution of benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we propose RIDE, a novel adversarial question-rewriting framework that leverages Item Response Theory (IRT) to rigorously measure question difficulty and to generate intrinsically more challenging, well-posed variations of mathematical problems. We employ 35 LLMs to simulate students and build a difficulty ranker from their responses. This ranker provides a reward signal during reinforcement learning and guides a question-rewriting model to reformulate existing questions across difficulty levels. Applying RIDE to competition-level mathematical benchmarks yields perturbed versions that degrade advanced LLM performance, with experiments showing an average 21.73% drop across 26 models, thereby exposing limited robustness in mathematical reasoning and confirming the validity of our evaluation approach.</p></details> |  |

While much research has focused on prompt structure, the natural language proficiency is an underexplored factor that can influence the quality of generated code. This paper investigates whether the English language proficiency itself independent of the prompting technique affects the proficiency and correctness of code generated by LLMs. Using the HumanEval dataset, we systematically varied the English proficiency of prompts from basic to advanced for 164 programming tasks and measured the resulting code proficiency and correctness. Our findings show that LLMs default to an intermediate (B2) natural language level. While the effect on the resulting code proficiency was model-dependent, we found that higher-proficiency prompts consistently yielded more correct code across all models. These results demonstrate that natural language proficiency is a key lever for controlling code generation, helping developers tailor AI output and improve the reliability of solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |

For challenging problems, the forking tokens that trigger diverse yet correct reasoning modes are typically deep in the sampling tree. Consequently, common strategies to encourage diversity, such as temperature scaling, encounter a worsened trade-off between diversity and accuracy. Motivated by this challenge, we treat parallel reasoning as a set-of-next-token-prediction problem, and incorporate a set-based global loss into Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using self-supervised bipartite matching between our global forking tokens and unique reasoning traces. We observe that, while naive fine-tuning with multiple reasoning traces collapses these unique reasoning modes, our proposed method, Set Supervised Fine-Tuning (SSFT), preserves these modes and produces emergent global forking tokens. Experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks show that our SSFT consistently outperforms SFT under both Pass@1 and Cons@k metrics.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we show that batching offers an additional, underappreciated benefit: it regularizes model behavior during multi-step reasoning for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). We conduct a comprehensive study across 13 diverse benchmarks and observe that batching improves accuracy while substantially reducing reasoning token usage, often by 3x-5x. Through detailed behavioral analysis, we find that batching suppresses overthinking, reduces hedging language (e.g., repetitive self-corrections), and encourages more decisive answers. Surprisingly, we also observe emergent collective effects in batched inference: models often generalize patterns from earlier examples to solve harder ones in the same batch. These findings position batching not just as a throughput optimization, but as a powerful inference-time regularizer for more efficient and reliable LLM reasoning.</p></details> |  |

However, standardized documents (e.g., SEC filing) share similar formats such as repetitive boilerplate texts, and similar table structures. This similarity forces traditional RAG methods to misidentify near-duplicate text, leading to duplicate retrieval that undermines accuracy and completeness. To address these issues, we propose the Hierarchical Retrieval with Evidence Curation (HiREC) framework. Our approach first performs hierarchical retrieval to reduce confusion among similar texts. It first retrieve related documents and then selects the most relevant passages from the documents. The evidence curation process removes irrelevant passages. When necessary, it automatically generates complementary queries to collect missing information. To evaluate our approach, we construct and release a Large-scale Open-domain Financial (LOFin) question answering benchmark that includes 145,897 SEC documents and 1,595 question-answer pairs. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/deep-over/LOFin-bench-HiREC.</p></details> | ACL 2025 (Findings) |

Employing speculative decoding (SD) can further accelerate MoE inference by drafting multiple tokens per step and verifying them in parallel. However, combining MoE with SD inflates GPU memory and aggravates CPU-GPU bandwidth contention during multi-token verification. Existing MoE offloading systems are SD-agnostic and do not address this bottleneck. We present SP-MoE, the first SD-aware expert-offloading and compute-communication pipelining framework. SP-MoE introduces: (1) speculative expert prefetching that exploits structural correspondence between the draft and target models to prefetch likely experts ahead of verification; (2) a cutoff-layer policy that bounds per-layer prefetch depth based on empirical profiles and an analytical latency model, guaranteeing just-in-time availability without overfetch; and (3) a pipelined runtime with asynchronous prefetch threads and batched I/O to hide loading latency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SP-MoE achieves a 1.07-3.5 times TPOT speedup over state-of-the-art methods across diverse datasets, environments, and MoE-based models.</p></details> |  |

A Comprehensive Benchmark for Perspective Perception, Reasoning, and Robustness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20426v4)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding perspective is fundamental to human visual perception, yet the extent to which multimodal large language models (MLLMs) internalize perspective geometry remains unclear. We introduce MMPerspective, the first benchmark specifically designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs' understanding of perspective through 10 carefully crafted tasks across three complementary dimensions: Perspective Perception, Reasoning, and Robustness. Our benchmark comprises 2,711 real-world and synthetic image instances with 5,083 question-answer pairs that probe key capabilities, such as vanishing point perception and counting, perspective type reasoning, line relationship understanding in 3D space, invariance to perspective-preserving transformations, etc. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 43 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we uncover significant limitations: while models demonstrate competence on surface-level perceptual tasks, they struggle with compositional reasoning and maintaining spatial consistency under perturbations. Our analysis further reveals intriguing patterns between model architecture, scale, and perspective capabilities, highlighting both robustness bottlenecks and the benefits of chain-of-thought prompting. MMPerspective establishes a valuable testbed for diagnosing and advancing spatial understanding in vision-language systems.

However, existing methods lack the flexibility to modulate this reasoning strength, limiting MLLMs' adaptability across factual and creative scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose equipping MLLMs with mechanisms that enable flexible control over associative reasoning. We begin by investigating the internal mechanisms underlying associative behavior in MLLMs and find that: (1) middle layers play a pivotal role in shaping model's associative tendencies, (2) modifying representations in these layers effectively regulates associative reasoning strength, and (3) hallucinations can be exploited to derive steering vectors that guide this modulation. Building on these findings, we introduce Flexible Association Control (FlexAC), a lightweight and training-free framework for modulating associative behavior in MLLMs. FlexAC first induces hallucination-guided intermediate representations to encode associative directions. Then, it selects high-association instances to construct effective associative steering vectors, whose strengths are adaptively calibrated to balance creative guidance with output stability. Finally, recognizing the multi-dimensional nature of associative reasoning, FlexAC incorporates task-specific associative vectors derived from a forward pass on a few target-domain samples, enabling models to follow diverse associative directions and better adapt to creative tasks. Notably, our method achieves up to a 5.8x improvement in creativity on Creation-MMBench and a 29% reduction in hallucination rate on CHAIR, surpassing existing baselines and demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling flexible control over associative reasoning in MLLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/ylhz/FlexAC.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 11 figures.

However, existing methods that rely on finetuned LLMs or GNN retrievers are limited by dataset-specific tuning and scalability on large or unseen graphs. We propose the LLM-KGFR collaborative framework, where an LLM works with a structured retriever, the Knowledge Graph Foundation Retriever (KGFR). KGFR encodes relations using LLM-generated descriptions and initializes entities based on their roles in the question, enabling zero-shot generalization to unseen KGs. To handle large graphs efficiently, it employs Asymmetric Progressive Propagation (APP)- a stepwise expansion that selectively limits high-degree nodes while retaining informative paths. Through node-, edge-, and path-level interfaces, the LLM iteratively requests candidate answers, supporting facts, and reasoning paths, forming a controllable reasoning loop. Experiments demonstrate that LLM-KGFR achieves strong performance while maintaining scalability and generalization, providing a practical solution for KG-augmented reasoning.</p></details> |  |

The challenge lies in accurately predicting the correlation between queries and products. Recently, mining the cross-features between queries and products based on the commonsense reasoning capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown promising performance. However, such methods suffer from high costs due to intensive real-time LLM inference during serving, as well as human annotations and potential Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT). To boost efficiency while leveraging the commonsense reasoning capacity of LLMs for various e-commerce tasks, we propose the Efficient Commonsense-Augmented Recommendation Enhancer (E-CARE). During inference, models augmented with E-CARE can access commonsense reasoning with only a single LLM forward pass per query by utilizing a commonsense reasoning factor graph that encodes most of the reasoning schema from powerful LLMs. The experiments on 2 downstream tasks show an improvement of up to 12.1% on precision@5.</p></details> |  |
| **[Caption Injection for Optimization in Generative Search Engine](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04080v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Search Engines (GSEs) leverage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques and Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate multi-source information and provide users with accurate and comprehensive responses. Unlike traditional search engines that present results in ranked lists, GSEs shift users' attention from sequential browsing to content-driven subjective perception, driving a paradigm shift in information retrieval. In this context, enhancing the subjective visibility of content through Generative Search Engine Optimization (G-SEO) methods has emerged as a new research focus. With the rapid advancement of Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) techniques, GSEs can now efficiently integrate text, images, audio, and video, producing richer responses that better satisfy complex information needs. Existing G-SEO methods, however, remain limited to text-based optimization and fail to fully exploit multimodal data. To address this gap, we propose Caption Injection, the first multimodal G-SEO approach, which extracts captions from images and injects them into textual content, integrating visual semantics to enhance the subjective visibility of content in generative search scenarios. We systematically evaluate Caption Injection on MRAMG, a benchmark for MRAG, under both unimodal and multimodal settings. Experimental results show that Caption Injection significantly outperforms text-only G-SEO baselines under the G-Eval metric, demonstrating the necessity and effectiveness of multimodal integration in G-SEO to improve user-perceived content visibility.</p></details> |  |

The ability to form associative links between seemingly unrelated concepts can be the driving mechanisms of creativity. We perform a comparison of the associative behaviour of humans compared to large language models. More specifically, we explore associations to emotionally loaded words and try to determine whether large language models generate associations in a similar way to humans. We find that the overlap between humans and LLMs is moderate, but also that the associations of LLMs tend to amplify the underlying emotional load of the stimulus, and that they tend to be more predictable and less creative than human ones.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 1 figure.

While existing computational methods primarily aim to generate large ensembles of legally valid districting plans, they often neglect the strategic dynamics involved in the selection process. This oversight creates opportunities for partisan actors to cherry-pick maps that, while technically compliant, are politically advantageous. Simply satisfying formal constraints does not ensure fairness when the selection process itself can be manipulated. We propose \textbf{Agentmandering}, a framework that reimagines redistricting as a turn-based negotiation between two agents representing opposing political interests. Drawing inspiration from game-theoretic ideas, particularly the \textit{Choose-and-Freeze} protocol, our method embeds strategic interaction into the redistricting process via large language model (LLM) agents. Agents alternate between selecting and freezing districts from a small set of candidate maps, gradually partitioning the state through constrained and interpretable choices. Evaluation on post-2020 U.S. Census data across all states shows that Agentmandering significantly reduces partisan bias and unfairness, while achieving 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower variance than standard baselines. These results demonstrate both fairness and stability, especially in swing-state scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/Lihaogx/AgentMandering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI AISI 2026</p></details> |

| **[RAGalyst: Automated Human-Aligned Agentic Evaluation for Domain-Specific RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04502v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a critical technique for grounding Large Language Models (LLMs) in factual evidence, yet evaluating RAG systems in specialized, safety-critical domains remains a significant challenge. Existing evaluation frameworks often rely on heuristic-based metrics that fail to capture domain-specific nuances and other works utilize LLM-as-a-Judge approaches that lack validated alignment with human judgment. This paper introduces RAGalyst, an automated, human-aligned agentic framework designed for the rigorous evaluation of domain-specific RAG systems. RAGalyst features an agentic pipeline that generates high-quality, synthetic question-answering (QA) datasets from source documents, incorporating an agentic filtering step to ensure data fidelity. The framework refines two key LLM-as-a-Judge metrics-Answer Correctness and Answerability-using prompt optimization to achieve a strong correlation with human annotations. Applying this framework to evaluate various RAG components across three distinct domains (military operations, cybersecurity, and bridge engineering), we find that performance is highly context-dependent. No single embedding model, LLM, or hyperparameter configuration proves universally optimal. Additionally, we provide an analysis on the most common low Answer Correctness reasons in RAG. These findings highlight the necessity of a systematic evaluation framework like RAGalyst, which empowers practitioners to uncover domain-specific trade-offs and make informed design choices for building reliable and effective RAG systems. RAGalyst is available on our Github.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents two complementary efforts at Vectara to measure and benchmark LLM faithfulness in RAG. First, we describe our original hallucination leaderboard, which has tracked hallucination rates for LLMs since 2023 using our HHEM hallucination detection model. Motivated by limitations observed in current hallucination detection methods, we introduce FaithJudge, an LLM-as-a-judge framework that leverages a pool of diverse human-annotated hallucination examples to substantially improve the automated hallucination evaluation of LLMs. We introduce an enhanced hallucination leaderboard centered on FaithJudge that benchmarks LLMs on RAG faithfulness in summarization, question-answering, and data-to-text generation tasks. FaithJudge enables a more reliable benchmarking of LLM hallucinations in RAG and supports the development of more trustworthy generative AI systems: https://github.com/vectara/FaithJudge.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP Industry Track 2025</p></details> |

While previous approaches in the Indian context have relied on internal case content such as facts, issues, and reasoning, they often overlook a core element of common law systems, which is reliance on statutory provisions and judicial precedents. In this work, we propose NyayaRAG, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that simulates realistic courtroom scenarios by providing models with factual case descriptions, relevant legal statutes, and semantically retrieved prior cases. NyayaRAG evaluates the effectiveness of these combined inputs in predicting court decisions and generating legal explanations using a domain-specific pipeline tailored to the Indian legal system. We assess performance across various input configurations using both standard lexical and semantic metrics as well as LLM-based evaluators such as G-Eval. Our results show that augmenting factual inputs with structured legal knowledge significantly improves both predictive accuracy and explanation quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted in the AACL-IJCNLP 2025 conference</p></details> |

Existing approaches often rely on monolithic graph retrieval, incurring unnecessary latency for simple queries and fragmented reasoning for complex multi-hop questions. To address these challenges, this paper propose SPLIT-RAG, a multi-agent RAG framework that addresses these limitations with question-driven semantic graph partitioning and collaborative subgraph retrieval. The innovative framework first create Semantic Partitioning of Linked Information, then use the Type-Specialized knowledge base to achieve Multi-Agent RAG. The attribute-aware graph segmentation manages to divide knowledge graphs into semantically coherent subgraphs, ensuring subgraphs align with different query types, while lightweight LLM agents are assigned to partitioned subgraphs, and only relevant partitions are activated during retrieval, thus reduce search space while enhancing efficiency. Finally, a hierarchical merging module resolves inconsistencies across subgraph-derived answers through logical verifications. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates considerable improvements compared to existing approaches.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |

Thus, the increasing prominence of RAG alongside Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked interest in comparing the performance of different LLMs in question-answering (QA) in diverse domains. This study compares the performance of four open-source LLMs, Mistral-7b-instruct, LLaMa2-7b-chat, Falcon-7b-instruct and Orca-mini-v3-7b, and OpenAI's trending GPT-3.5 over QA tasks within the computer science literature leveraging RAG support. Evaluation metrics employed in the study include accuracy and precision for binary questions and ranking by a human expert, ranking by Google's AI model Gemini, alongside cosine similarity for long-answer questions. GPT-3.5, when paired with RAG, effectively answers binary and long-answer questions, reaffirming its status as an advanced LLM. Regarding open-source LLMs, Mistral AI's Mistral-7b-instruct paired with RAG surpasses the rest in answering both binary and long-answer questions. However, among the open-source LLMs, Orca-mini-v3-7b reports the shortest average latency in generating responses, whereas LLaMa2-7b-chat by Meta reports the highest average latency. This research underscores the fact that open-source LLMs, too, can go hand in hand with proprietary models like GPT-3.5 with better infrastructure.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables, presented at the 5th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education Technology</p></details> |
| **[Cache Mechanism for Agent RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02919v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have been propelled by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which grants the models access to vast external knowledge bases. Despite RAG's success in improving agent performance, agent-level cache management, particularly constructing, maintaining, and updating a compact, relevant corpus dynamically tailored to each agent's need, remains underexplored. Therefore, we introduce ARC (Agent RAG Cache Mechanism), a novel, annotation-free caching framework that dynamically manages small, high-value corpora for each agent. By synthesizing historical query distribution patterns with the intrinsic geometry of cached items in the embedding space, ARC automatically maintains a high-relevance cache. With comprehensive experiments on three retrieval datasets, our experimental results demonstrate that ARC reduces storage requirements to 0.015% of the original corpus while offering up to 79.8% has-answer rate and reducing average retrieval latency by 80%. Our results demonstrate that ARC can drastically enhance efficiency and effectiveness in RAG-powered LLM agents.</p></details> |  |

However, its adoption is hindered by the complexity of policy languages and the risk of misconfigurations. In this work, we present ARPaCCino, an agentic system that combines Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG), and tool-based validation to automate the generation and verification of PaC rules. Given natural language descriptions of the desired policies, ARPaCCino generates formal Rego rules, assesses IaC compliance, and iteratively refines the IaC configurations to ensure conformance. Thanks to its modular agentic architecture and integration with external tools and knowledge bases, ARPaCCino supports policy validation across a wide range of technologies, including niche or emerging IaC frameworks. Experimental evaluation involving a Terraform-based case study demonstrates ARPaCCino's effectiveness in generating syntactically and semantically correct policies, identifying non-compliant infrastructures, and applying corrective modifications, even when using smaller, open-weight LLMs. Our results highlight the potential of agentic RAG architectures to enhance the automation, reliability, and accessibility of PaC workflows.</p></details> |  |

However, despite their widespread use, popular datasets such as WebQSP and CWQ suffer from critical quality issues, including inaccurate or incomplete ground-truth annotations, poorly constructed questions that are ambiguous, trivial, or unanswerable, and outdated or inconsistent knowledge. Through a manual audit of 16 popular KGQA datasets, including WebQSP and CWQ, we find that the average factual correctness rate is only 57 %. To address these issues, we introduce KGQAGen, an LLM-in-the-loop framework that systematically resolves these pitfalls. KGQAGen combines structured knowledge grounding, LLM-guided generation, and symbolic verification to produce challenging and verifiable QA instances. Using KGQAGen, we construct KGQAGen-10k, a ten-thousand scale benchmark grounded in Wikidata, and evaluate a diverse set of KG-RAG models. Experimental results demonstrate that even state-of-the-art systems struggle on this benchmark, highlighting its ability to expose limitations of existing models. Our findings advocate for more rigorous benchmark construction and position KGQAGen as a scalable framework for advancing KGQA evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 Datasets and Benchmarks Track</p></details> |
| **[A Graph-based RAG for Energy Efficiency Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01643v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we investigate the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) within a graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture for Energy Efficiency (EE) Question Answering. First, the system automatically extracts a Knowledge Graph (KG) from guidance and regulatory documents in the energy field. Then, the generated graph is navigated and reasoned upon to provide users with accurate answers in multiple languages. We implement a human-based validation using the RAGAs framework properties, a validation dataset comprising 101 question-answer pairs, and domain experts. Results confirm the potential of this architecture and identify its strengths and weaknesses. Validation results show how the system correctly answers in about three out of four of the cases (75.2 +- 2.7%), with higher results on questions related to more general EE answers (up to 81.0 +- 4.1%), and featuring promising multilingual abilities (4.4% accuracy loss due to translation).</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a reproducible draft-based refinement pipeline that elevates open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to a performance level statistically comparable to top-tier proprietary systems. Our method first uses a fine-tuned NLLB-1.3B model to generate a high-quality, structurally faithful draft. A zero-shot LLM (Llama-3.3 or Qwen3) then polishes this draft, a process that can be further enhanced by augmenting the context with retrieved out-context examples (RAG). We demonstrate the robustness of this approach on two distinct benchmarks: a standard in-domain test set (Rosenthal, 2023) and a new, challenging out-of-domain (OOD) set of 12th-century Latin letters (2025). Our central finding is that this open-source RAG system achieves performance statistically comparable to the GPT-5 baseline, without any task-specific LLM fine-tuning. We release the pipeline, the Chartres OOD set, and evaluation scripts and models to facilitate replicability and further research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rescuing the Unpoisoned: Efficient Defense against Knowledge Corruption Attacks on RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01268v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are reshaping numerous facets of our daily lives, leading widespread adoption as web-based services. Despite their versatility, LLMs face notable challenges, such as generating hallucinated content and lacking access to up-to-date information. Lately, to address such limitations, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising direction by generating responses grounded in external knowledge sources. A typical RAG system consists of i) a retriever that probes a group of relevant passages from a knowledge base and ii) a generator that formulates a response based on the retrieved content. However, as with other AI systems, recent studies demonstrate the vulnerability of RAG, such as knowledge corruption attacks by injecting misleading information. In response, several defense strategies have been proposed, including having LLMs inspect the retrieved passages individually or fine-tuning robust retrievers. While effective, such approaches often come with substantial computational costs. In this work, we introduce RAGDefender, a resource-efficient defense mechanism against knowledge corruption (i.e., by data poisoning) attacks in practical RAG deployments. RAGDefender operates during the post-retrieval phase, leveraging lightweight machine learning techniques to detect and filter out adversarial content without requiring additional model training or inference. Our empirical evaluations show that RAGDefender consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art defenses across multiple models and adversarial scenarios: e.g., RAGDefender reduces the attack success rate (ASR) against the Gemini model from 0.89 to as low as 0.02, compared to 0.69 for RobustRAG and 0.24 for Discern-and-Answer when adversarial passages outnumber legitimate ones by a factor of four (4x).</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures, 10 tables.

A Fact-Checking Dataset for Evaluating the Robustness of RAG Against Misleading Retrievals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16101v4)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has shown impressive capabilities in mitigating hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs struggle to maintain consistent reasoning when exposed to misleading or conflicting evidence, especially in real-world domains such as politics, where information is polarized or selectively framed. Mainstream RAG benchmarks evaluate models under clean retrieval settings, where systems generate answers from gold-standard documents, or under synthetically perturbed settings, where documents are artificially injected with noise. These assumptions fail to reflect real-world conditions, often leading to an overestimation of RAG system performance. To address this gap, we introduce RAGuard, the first benchmark to evaluate the robustness of RAG systems against misleading retrievals. Unlike prior benchmarks that rely on synthetic noise, our fact-checking dataset captures naturally occurring misinformation by constructing its retrieval corpus from Reddit discussions. It categorizes retrieved evidence into three types: supporting, misleading, and unrelated, providing a realistic and challenging testbed for assessing how well RAG systems navigate different types of evidence. Our experiments reveal that, when exposed to potentially misleading retrievals, all tested LLM-powered RAG systems perform worse than their zero-shot baselines (i.e., no retrieval at all), while human annotators consistently perform better, highlighting LLMs' susceptibility to noisy environments. To our knowledge, RAGuard is the first benchmark to systematically assess the robustness of the RAG against misleading evidence. We expect this benchmark to drive future research toward improving RAG systems beyond idealized datasets, making them more reliable for real-world applications.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates personal medical documents into LLMs by an external retrievable database to address the costly retraining or fine-tuning issues in deploying customized agents. While deploying medical agents in edge devices ensures privacy protection, RAG implementations impose substantial memory access and energy consumption during the retrieval stage. This paper presents a hierarchical retrieval architecture for edge RAG, leveraging a two-stage retrieval scheme that combines approximate retrieval for candidate set generation, followed by high-precision retrieval on pre-selected document embeddings. The proposed architecture significantly reduces energy consumption and external memory access while maintaining retrieval accuracy. Simulation results show that, under TSMC 28nm technology, the proposed hierarchical retrieval architecture has reduced the overall memory access by nearly 50% and the computation by 75% compared to pure INT8 retrieval, and the total energy consumption for 1 MB data retrieval is 177.76 {\mu}J/query.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by BioCAS2025</p></details> |

However, most existing approaches rely on unrealistic assumptions in which external attackers have access to internal components such as the retriever. To address this issue, we introduce a realistic black-box attack based on the RAG paradox, a structural vulnerability arising from the system's effort to enhance trust by revealing both the retrieved documents and their sources to users. This transparency enables attackers to observe which sources are used and how information is phrased, allowing them to craft poisoned documents that are more likely to be retrieved and upload them to the identified sources. Moreover, as RAG systems directly provide retrieved content to users, these documents must not only be retrievable but also appear natural and credible to maintain user confidence in the search results. Unlike prior work that focuses solely on improving document retrievability, our attack method explicitly considers both retrievability and user trust in the retrieved content. Both offline and online experiments demonstrate that our method significantly degrades system performance without internal access, while generating natural-looking poisoned documents.</p></details> |  |

Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MM-RAG) plays a key role in supporting such questions, yet there is still no comprehensive benchmark for this task, especially regarding wearables scenarios. To fill this gap, we present CRAG-MM -- a Comprehensive RAG benchmark for Multi-modal Multi-turn conversations. CRAG-MM contains a diverse set of 6.5K (image, question, answer) triplets and 2K visual-based multi-turn conversations across 13 domains, including 6.2K egocentric images designed to mimic captures from wearable devices. We carefully constructed the questions to reflect real-world scenarios and challenges, including five types of image-quality issues, six question types, varying entity popularity, differing information dynamism, and different conversation turns. We design three tasks: single-source augmentation, multi-source augmentation, and multi-turn conversations -- each paired with an associated retrieval corpus and APIs for both image-KG retrieval and webpage retrieval. Our evaluation shows that straightforward RAG approaches achieve only 32% and 43% truthfulness on CRAG-MM single- and multi-turn QA, respectively, whereas state-of-the-art industry solutions have similar quality (32%/45%), underscoring ample room for improvement. The benchmark has hosted KDD Cup 2025, attracting about 1K participants and 5K submissions, with winning solutions improving baseline performance by 28%, highlighting its early impact on advancing the field.</p></details> |  |

This issue is particularly critical for the Persian-speaking Muslim community, where accuracy and trustworthiness are paramount. Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, relying on simplistic single-pass pipelines, fall short on complex, multi-hop queries requiring multi-step reasoning and evidence aggregation. To address this gap, we introduce FARSIQA, a novel, end-to-end system for Faithful Advanced Question Answering in the Persian Islamic domain. FARSIQA is built upon our innovative FAIR-RAG architecture: a Faithful, Adaptive, Iterative Refinement framework for RAG. FAIR-RAG employs a dynamic, self-correcting process: it adaptively decomposes complex queries, assesses evidence sufficiency, and enters an iterative loop to generate sub-queries, progressively filling information gaps. Operating on a curated knowledge base of over one million authoritative Islamic documents, FARSIQA demonstrates superior performance. Rigorous evaluation on the challenging IslamicPCQA benchmark shows state-of-the-art performance: the system achieves a remarkable 97.0% in Negative Rejection - a 40-point improvement over baselines - and a high Answer Correctness score of 74.3%.

Computing-in-Memory (CIM) offers a promising solution by storing document embeddings in CIM macros and enabling in-situ parallel retrievals but is constrained by either low memory density or limited computational accuracy. To address these challenges, we present DIRCRAG, a novel edge RAG acceleration architecture leveraging Digital In-ReRAM Computation (DIRC). DIRC integrates a high-density multi-level ReRAM subarray with an SRAM cell, utilizing SRAM and differential sensing for robust ReRAM readout and digital multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations. By storing all document embeddings within the CIM macro, DIRC achieves ultra-low-power, single-cycle data loading, substantially reducing both energy consumption and latency compared to offchip DRAM. A query-stationary (QS) dataflow is supported for RAG tasks, minimizing on-chip data movement and reducing SRAM buffer requirements. We introduce error optimization for the DIRC ReRAM-SRAM cell by extracting the bit-wise spatial error distribution of the ReRAM subarray and applying targeted bit-wise data remapping. An error detection circuit is also implemented to enhance readout resilience against deviceand circuit-level variations. Simulation results demonstrate that DIRC-RAG under TSMC40nm process achieves an on-chip non-volatile memory density of 5.18Mb/mm2 and a throughput of 131 TOPS. It delivers a 4MB retrieval latency of 5.6{\mu}s/query and an energy consumption of 0.956{\mu}J/query, while maintaining the retrieval precision.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 IEEE/ACM ISLPED</p></details> |

Evaluating RAG-based Pipelines for Professional Fact-Checking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15189v3)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural Language Processing and Generation systems have recently shown the potential to complement and streamline the costly and time-consuming job of professional fact-checkers. In this work, we lift several constraints of current state-of-the-art pipelines for automated fact-checking based on the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigm. Our goal is to benchmark, following professional fact-checking practices, RAG-based methods for the generation of verdicts - i.e., short texts discussing the veracity of a claim - evaluating them on stylistically complex claims and heterogeneous, yet reliable, knowledge bases. Our findings show a complex landscape, where, for example, LLM-based retrievers outperform other retrieval techniques, though they still struggle with heterogeneous knowledge bases; larger models excel in verdict faithfulness, while smaller models provide better context adherence, with human evaluations favouring zero-shot and one-shot approaches for informativeness, and fine-tuned models for emotional alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data at https://github.com/drusso98/face-the-facts - Accepted for publication at INLG 2025</p></details> |

To address this challenge, we propose R3, a Retrieval framework optimized for RAG through trialand-feedback Reinforced contrastive learning. Unlike prior approaches that rely on annotated or synthetic data for supervised fine-tuning, R3 enables the retriever to dynamically explore and optimize relevance within the RAG environment. During training, the retrieved results interact with the environment to produce contrastive signals that automatically guide the retriever's self-improvement. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate that R3 improves RAG performance by 5.2% over the original retriever and surpasses state-of-the-art retrievers by 4.9%, while achieving comparable results to LLM-augmented retrieval and RAG systems built on post-trained or instruction-tuned LLMs. It is both efficient and practical, requiring only 4 GPUs and completing training within a single day.</p></details> |  |

Among various mitigation strategies, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and reasoning enhancement have emerged as two of the most effective and widely adopted approaches, marking a shift from merely suppressing hallucinations to balancing creativity and reliability. However, their synergistic potential and underlying mechanisms for hallucination mitigation have not yet been systematically examined. This survey adopts an application-oriented perspective of capability enhancement to analyze how RAG, reasoning enhancement, and their integration in Agentic Systems mitigate hallucinations. We propose a taxonomy distinguishing knowledge-based and logic-based hallucinations, systematically examine how RAG and reasoning address each, and present a unified framework supported by real-world applications, evaluations, and benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

LLMs can retrieve relevant medical articles to generate more professional responses efficiently. However, current RAG applications still face problems. They generate incorrect information, such as hallucinations, and they fail to use external knowledge correctly. To solve these issues, we propose a new method named M-Eval. This method is inspired by the heterogeneity analysis approach used in Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM). Our approach can check for factual errors in RAG responses using evidence from multiple sources. First, we extract additional medical literature from external knowledge bases. Then, we retrieve the evidence documents generated by the RAG system. We use heterogeneity analysis to check whether the evidence supports different viewpoints in the response. In addition to verifying the accuracy of the response, we also assess the reliability of the evidence provided by the RAG system. Our method shows an improvement of up to 23.31% accuracy across various LLMs. This work can help detect errors in current RAG-based medical systems. It also makes the applications of LLMs more reliable and reduces diagnostic errors.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Cross-Lingual Cost: Retrieval Biases in RAG over Arabic-English Corpora](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07543v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-lingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a critical capability for retrieving and generating answers across languages. Prior work in this context has mostly focused on generation and relied on benchmarks derived from open-domain sources, most notably Wikipedia. In such settings, retrieval challenges often remain hidden due to language imbalances, overlap with pretraining data, and memorized content. To address this gap, we study Arabic-English RAG in a domain-specific setting using benchmarks derived from real-world corporate datasets. Our benchmarks include all combinations of languages for the user query and the supporting document, drawn independently and uniformly at random. This enables a systematic study of multilingual retrieval behavior. Our findings reveal that retrieval is a critical bottleneck in cross-lingual domain-specific scenarios, with substantial performance drops occurring when the user query and supporting document languages differ. A key insight is that these failures stem primarily from the retriever's difficulty in ranking documents across languages. Finally, we propose two simple retrieval strategies that address this source of failure by enforcing equal retrieval from both languages or by translating the query, resulting in substantial improvements in cross-lingual and overall performance. These results highlight meaningful opportunities for improving multilingual retrieval, particularly in practical, real-world RAG applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ArabicNLP 2025</p></details> |

However, poor translation quality degrades response generation performance. Existing approaches either assume sufficient translation quality or utilize the rewriting method, which introduces factual distortion and hallucinations. To mitigate these problems, we propose Quality-Aware Translation Tagging in mRAG (QTT-RAG), which explicitly evaluates translation quality along three dimensions-semantic equivalence, grammatical accuracy, and naturalness&fluency-and attach these scores as metadata without altering the original content. We evaluate QTT-RAG against CrossRAG and DKM-RAG as baselines in two open-domain QA benchmarks (XORQA, MKQA) using six instruction-tuned LLMs ranging from 2.4B to 14B parameters, covering two low-resource languages (Korean and Finnish) and one high-resource language (Chinese). QTT-RAG outperforms the baselines by preserving factual integrity while enabling generator models to make informed decisions based on translation reliability. This approach allows for effective usage of cross-lingual documents in low-resource settings with limited native language documents, offering a practical and robust solution across multilingual domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 MRL Workshop</p></details> |

Accurate family identification can greatly facilitate automated sample labeling and understanding on crowdsourced malware analysis platforms such as VirusTotal and MalwareBazaar, which generate vast amounts of data daily. In this paper, we explore and assess the feasibility of using traditional binary string features for family classification in the new era of large language models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Specifically, we investigate howFamily-Specific String (FSS) features can be utilized in a manner similar to RAG to facilitate family classification. To this end, we develop a curated evaluation framework covering 4,347 samples from 67 malware families, extract and analyze over 25 million strings, and conduct detailed ablation studies to assess the impact of different design choices in four major modules, with each providing a relative improvement ranging from 8.1% to 120%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a technical report from Lingnan University, Hong Kong.

Maximising attacker engagement is essential to their utility. However research has highlighted that context-awareness, such as the ability to respond to new attack types, systems and attacker agents, is necessary to increase engagement. Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown as one approach to increase context awareness but suffer from several challenges including accuracy and timeliness of response time, high operational costs and data-protection issues due to cloud deployment. We propose the System-Based Attention Shell Honeypot (SBASH) framework which manages data-protection issues through the use of lightweight local LLMs. We investigate the use of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) supported LLMs and non-RAG LLMs for Linux shell commands and evaluate them using several different metrics such as response time differences, realism from human testers, and similarity to a real system calculated with Levenshtein distance, SBert, and BertScore. We show that RAG improves accuracy for untuned models while models that have been tuned via a system prompt that tells the LLM to respond like a Linux system achieve without RAG a similar accuracy as untuned with RAG, while having a slightly lower latency.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in: The 3rd International Conference on Foundation and Large Language Models (FLLM2025), IEEE, 2025</p></details> |

However, this broad-view approach often lacks the deep structured reasoning needed for complex multi-hop question answering (QA), leading to incomplete evidence and error accumulation. To address these limitations, we propose SubQRAG, a sub-question-driven framework that enhances reasoning depth. SubQRAG decomposes a complex question into an ordered chain of verifiable sub-questions. For each sub-question, it retrieves relevant triples from the graph. When the existing graph is insufficient, the system dynamically expands it by extracting new triples from source documents in real time. All triples used in the reasoning process are aggregated into a "graph memory," forming a structured and traceable evidence path for final answer generation. Experiments on three multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that SubQRAG achieves consistent and significant improvements, especially in Exact Match scores.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 figure |

However, these state-of-the-art-performance is predominantly in English language. To address this gap we made an effort of bridging language gaps by incorporating Adaptive RAG system to Indonesian language. Adaptive RAG system integrates a classifier whose task is to distinguish the question complexity, which in turn determines the strategy for answering the question. To overcome the limited availability of Indonesian language dataset, our study employs machine translation as data augmentation approach. Experiments show reliable question complexity classifier; however, we observed significant inconsistencies in multi-retrieval answering strategy which negatively impacted the overall evaluation when this strategy was applied. These findings highlight both the promise and challenges of question answering in low-resource language suggesting directions for future improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Using two complementary tasks from Long Code Arena -- code completion and bug localization -- we systematically compare retrieval configurations across various context window sizes along three axes: (i) chunking strategy, (ii) similarity scoring, and (iii) splitting granularity. (1) For PL-PL, sparse BM25 with word-level splitting is the most effective and practical, significantly outperforming dense alternatives while being an order of magnitude faster. (2) For NL-PL, proprietary dense encoders (Voyager-3 family) consistently beat sparse retrievers, however requiring 100x larger latency. (3) Optimal chunk size scales with available context: 32-64 line chunks work best at small budgets, and whole-file retrieval becomes competitive at 16000 tokens. (4) Simple line-based chunking matches syntax-aware splitting across budgets. (5) Retrieval latency varies by up to 200x across configurations; BPE-based splitting is needlessly slow, and BM25 + word splitting offers the best quality-latency trade-off. Thus, we provide evidence-based recommendations for implementing effective code-oriented RAG systems based on task requirements, model constraints, and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, the introduction of external knowledge bases presents RAG with challenges in long-context processing, significantly increasing memory consumption and inference latency. Existing research accelerates inference by precomputing Key and Value (KV) of the knowledge base and loading them on-demand during inference. Based on the access frequency of different KV chunks within the external knowledge base, this paper proposes a hotness-aware RAG (HA-RAG) inference optimization system. First, leveraging the numerical distribution of KV chunks, we introduce a hotness-aware mixed-precision compressing and loading method to reduce disk I/O and memory access overhead. Second, we design a hotness-aware data placement strategy that prioritizes storing frequently accessed KV chunks in high-speed memory to improve data access efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with TurboRAG, the proposed HA-RAG achieves an average speedup of 2.10x and maximum speedup of 10.49x in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) with negligible accuracy loss.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages,16 figures,2 tables</p></details> |

Although previous studies noted that retrieving many documents can degrade performance, they did not isolate how the quantity of documents affects performance while controlling for context length. We evaluate various language models on custom datasets derived from a multi-hop QA task. We keep the context length and position of relevant information constant while varying the number of documents, and find that increasing the document count in RAG settings poses significant challenges for most LLMs, reducing performance by up to 20%. However, Qwen2.5 maintained consistent results across increasing document counts, indicating better multi-document handling capability. Finally, our results indicate that processing multiple documents is a separate challenge from handling long contexts.

By integrating documents retrieved from a database into the prompt of a large language model (LLM), RAG enables more reliable and informative content generation. While there has been extensive research on vector databases, many open research problems remain once they are considered in the wider context of end-to-end RAG pipelines. One practical yet challenging problem is how to jointly optimize both system performance and generation quality in RAG, which is significantly more complex than it appears due to the numerous knobs on both the algorithmic side (spanning models and databases) and the systems side (from software to hardware). In this paper, we present RAG-Stack, a three-pillar blueprint for quality-performance co-optimization in RAG systems. RAG-Stack comprises: (1) RAG-IR, an intermediate representation that serves as an abstraction layer to decouple quality and performance aspects; (2) RAG-CM, a cost model for estimating system performance given an RAG-IR; and (3) RAG-PE, a plan exploration algorithm that searches for high-quality, high-performance RAG configurations. We believe this three-pillar blueprint will become the de facto paradigm for RAG quality-performance co-optimization in the years to come.</p></details> |  |

However, the dynamic nature of user interests and content poses a significant challenge: While initial fine-tuning aligns LLMs with domain knowledge and user preferences, it fails to capture such real-time changes, necessitating robust update mechanisms. This paper investigates strategies for updating LLM-powered recommenders, focusing on the trade-offs between ongoing fine-tuning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Using an LLM-powered user interest exploration system as a case study, we perform a comparative analysis of these methods across dimensions like cost, agility, and knowledge incorporation. We propose a hybrid update strategy that leverages the long-term knowledge adaptation of periodic fine-tuning with the agility of low-cost RAG. We demonstrate through live A/B experiments on a billion-user platform that this hybrid approach yields statistically significant improvements in user satisfaction, offering a practical and cost-effective framework for maintaining high-quality LLM-powered recommender systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>RecSy...</summary><p>RecSys 2025 Industry Track</p></details> |

Rather than explaining model internals, outputs are gated ex-ante and bound to cryptographically verifiable evidence for each material answer. Unvalidated targets are stated (>=20% relative reduction in confident errors; p95 latency <= 900 ms; <= 2.2x serve cost) together with a pre-registered (optional) pilot using NO-GO gates. The design complements existing RAG/guardrails by making policy checks auditable, replayable, and receipt-backed. Target domains include back-office compliance in pharma, medical devices, finance, legal, and the public sector where error costs may exceed thousands of euros and audit trails are mandatory under regulations such as the EU AI Act.

They often regenerate predictable token sequences at every step and rely on stochastic stopping, leading to excessive token usage and unstable termination. We propose TSSS (Think Straight, Stop Smart), a structured multi-hop RAG framework designed for efficiency. TSSS introduces (i) a template-based reasoning that caches recurring prefixes and anchors sub-queries to the main question, reducing token generation cost while promoting stable reasoning, and (ii) a retriever-based terminator, which deterministically halts reasoning once additional sub-queries collapse into repetition. This separation of structured reasoning and termination control enables both faster inference and more reliable answers.

A RAG Approach for Tree-based Structures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10806v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are adept at generating responses based on information within their context. While this ability is useful for interacting with structured data like code files, another popular method, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), retrieves relevant documents to augment the model's in-context learning. However, it is not well-explored how to best represent this retrieved knowledge for generating responses on structured data, particularly hierarchical structures like trees. In this work, we propose a novel bottom-up method to linearize knowledge from tree-like structures (like a GitHub repository) by generating implicit, aggregated summaries at each hierarchical level. This approach enables the knowledge to be stored in a knowledge base and used directly with RAG. We then compare our method to using RAG on raw, unstructured code, evaluating the accuracy and quality of the generated responses. Our results show that while response quality is comparable across both methods, our approach generates over 68% fewer documents in the retriever, a significant gain in efficiency. This finding suggests that leveraging implicit, linearized knowledge may be a highly effective and scalable strategy for handling complex, hierarchical data structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Waiti...</summary><p>Waiting for Conference Response</p></details> |

Efficiently selecting informative documents requires balancing a key trade-off: (i) retrieving broadly enough to capture all the relevant material, and (ii) limiting retrieval to avoid excessive noise and computational cost. We formulate query decomposition and document retrieval in an exploitation-exploration setting, where retrieving one document at a time builds a belief about the utility of a given sub-query and informs the decision to continue exploiting or exploring an alternative. We experiment with a variety of bandit learning methods and demonstrate their effectiveness in dynamically selecting the most informative sub-queries. Our main finding is that estimating document relevance using rank information and human judgments yields a 35% gain in document-level precision, 15% increase in {\alpha}-nDCG, and better performance on the downstream task of long-form generation.</p></details> |  |

Across four datasets, of which two open-domain and two proprietary, we find that synthetic benchmarks reliably rank the RAGs varying in terms of retriever configuration, aligning well with human-labeled benchmark baselines. However, they do not consistently produce reliable RAG rankings when comparing generator architectures. The breakdown possibly arises from a combination of task mismatch between the synthetic and human benchmarks, and stylistic bias favoring certain generators.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for the SynDAiTE workshop at the European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML-PKDD 2025), September 15, 2025 - Porto, Portugal</p></details> |

The core difficulty lies in Dual Dynamics: the constant interplay between game content updates and the shifting focus of the player community. Furthermore, the necessity of automating such a benchmark introduces a critical requirement for player-centric authenticity to ensure generated questions are realistic. To address this integrated challenge, we introduce ChronoPlay, a novel framework for the automated and continuous generation of game RAG benchmarks. ChronoPlay utilizes a dual-dynamic update mechanism to track both forms of change, and a dual-source synthesis engine that draws from official sources and player community to ensure both factual correctness and authentic query patterns. We instantiate our framework on three distinct games to create the first dynamic RAG benchmark for the gaming domain, offering new insights into model performance under these complex and realistic conditions.

However, existing RAG methods either rely solely on text corpora and neglect structural knowledge, or build ad-hoc knowledge graphs (KGs) at high cost and low reliability. To address these issues, we propose KG-Infused RAG, a framework that incorporates pre-existing large-scale KGs into RAG and applies spreading activation to enhance both retrieval and generation. KG-Infused RAG directly performs spreading activation over external KGs to retrieve relevant structured knowledge, which is then used to expand queries and integrated with corpus passages, enabling interpretable and semantically grounded multi-source retrieval. We further improve KG-Infused RAG through preference learning on sampled key stages of the pipeline. Experiments on five QA benchmarks show that KG-Infused RAG consistently outperforms vanilla RAG (by 3.9% to 17.8%). Compared with KG-based approaches such as GraphRAG and LightRAG, our method obtains structured knowledge at lower cost while achieving superior performance. Additionally, integrating KG-Infused RAG with Self-RAG and DeepNote yields further gains, demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility as a plug-and-play enhancement module for corpus-based RAG methods.</p></details> |  |

Despite their successful extensions, most applications of GraphRAG for text data have been designed for specific tasks and datasets, lacking a systematic evaluation and comparison between RAG and GraphRAG on widely used text-based benchmarks. In this paper, we systematically evaluate RAG and GraphRAG on well-established benchmark tasks, such as Question Answering and Query-based Summarization. Our results highlight the distinct strengths of RAG and GraphRAG across different tasks and evaluation perspectives. Inspired by these observations, we investigate strategies to integrate their strengths to improve downstream tasks. Additionally, we provide an in-depth discussion of the shortcomings of current GraphRAG approaches and outline directions for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-Tuning MedGemma for Clinical Captioning to Enhance Multimodal RAG over Malaysia CPGs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15418v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems are essential for providing fact-based guidance from Malaysian Clinical Practice Guidelines. However, their effectiveness with image-based queries is limited, as general Vision-Language Model captions often lack clinical specificity and factual grounding. This study proposes and validates a framework to specialize the MedGemma model for generating high-fidelity captions that serve as superior queries. To overcome data scarcity, we employ a knowledge distillation pipeline to create a synthetic dataset across dermatology, fundus, and chest radiography domains, and fine-tune MedGemma using the parameter-efficient QLoRA method. Performance was rigorously assessed through a dual framework measuring both classification accuracy and, via a novel application of the RAGAS framework, caption faithfulness, relevancy, and correctness. The fine-tuned model demonstrated substantial improvements in classification performance, while RAGAS evaluation confirmed significant gains in caption faithfulness and correctness, validating the models ability to produce reliable, factually grounded descriptions. This work establishes a robust pipeline for specializing medical VLMs and validates the resulting model as a high-quality query generator, laying the groundwork for enhancing multimodal RAG systems in evidence-based clinical decision support.</p></details> |  |
| **[Repairing Tool Calls Using Post-tool Execution Reflection and RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17874v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic systems interact with external systems by calling tools such as Python functions, REST API endpoints, or command line tools such as kubectl in Kubernetes. These tool calls often fail for various syntactic and semantic reasons. Some less obvious semantic errors can only be identified and resolved after analyzing the tool's response. To repair these errors, we develop a post-tool execution reflection component that combines large language model (LLM)-based reflection with domain-specific retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) using documents describing both the specific tool being called and troubleshooting documents related to the tool. For this paper, we focus on the use case of the kubectl command line tool to manage Kubernetes, a platform for orchestrating cluster applications. Through a larger empirical study and a smaller manual evaluation, we find that our RAG-based reflection will repair kubectl commands such that they are both more likely to successfully execute (pass rate) for 55% of our models evaluated and 36% more likely to correctly answer the user query on average. We find that troubleshooting documents improve pass rate compared to official documentation by an average of 10%.</p></details> |  |
| **[METIS: Fast Quality-Aware RAG Systems with Configuration Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10543v3)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) allows LLMs (large language models) to generate better responses with external knowledge, but using more external knowledge often improves generation quality at the expense of response delay. Prior work either reduces the response delay (through better scheduling of RAG queries) or strives to maximize quality (which involves tuning the RAG workflow), but they fall short in optimizing the tradeoff between the delay and quality of RAG responses. This paper presents METIS, the first RAG system that jointly schedules queries and adapts the key RAG configurations of each query, such as the number of retrieved text chunks and synthesis methods, in order to balance quality optimization and response delay reduction. Using 4 popular RAG-QA datasets, we show that compared with the state-of-the-art RAG optimization schemes, METIS reduces the generation latency by $1.64-2.54\times$ without sacrificing generation quality.</p></details> | 17 pages, 18 figures |
| **[Unmasking Hiring Bias: Platform Data Analysis and Controlled Experiments on Bias in Online Freelance Marketplaces via RAG-LLM Generated Contents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13091v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online freelance marketplaces, a rapidly growing part of the global labor market, are creating a fair environment where professional skills are the main factor for hiring. While these platforms can reduce bias from traditional hiring, the personal information in user profiles raises concerns about ongoing discrimination. Past studies on this topic have mostly used existing data, which makes it hard to control for other factors and clearly see the effect of things like gender or race. To solve these problems, this paper presents a new method that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a Large Language Model (LLM) to create realistic, artificial freelancer profiles for controlled experiments. This approach effectively separates individual factors, enabling a clearer statistical analysis of how different variables influence the freelancer project process. In addition to analyzing extracted data with traditional statistical methods for post-project stage analysis, our research utilizes a dataset with highly controlled variables, generated by an RAG-LLM, to conduct a simulated hiring experiment for pre-project stage analysis. The results of our experiments show that, regarding gender, while no significant preference emerged in initial hiring decisions, female freelancers are substantially more likely to receive imperfect ratings post-project stage. Regarding regional bias, a strong and consistent preference favoring US-based freelancers shows that people are more likely to be selected in the simulated experiments, perceived as more leader-like, and receive higher ratings on the live platform.</p></details> |  |
| **[EviNote-RAG: Enhancing RAG Models via Answer-Supportive Evidence Notes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00877v3)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has advanced open-domain question answering by incorporating external information into model reasoning. However, effectively leveraging external information to enhance reasoning presents the following challenges: (1) low signal-to-noise ratio, where answer-supportive external information is diluted by irrelevant material, and (2) error accumulation, which arises in multi-hop reasoning when incomplete or misleading information is incorporated. To address these challenges, we introduce EviNote-RAG, a framework that follows a retrieve-note-answer workflow. Instead of reasoning directly over raw external information, the model first produces Supportive-Evidence Notes (SENs), which concisely preserve answer-critical information and explicitly mark key and uncertainty information to improve accuracy. We further design an entailment-based Evidence Quality Reward (EQR) to ensure that SENs are logically sufficient to derive the final answer, thereby enhancing SENs' quality. Experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain QA benchmarks show that EviNote-RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving answer accuracy, training stability, robustness, and efficiency. In particular, it yields relative F1 gains of 20% on HotpotQA (+0.093), 40% on Bamboogle (+0.151), and 91% on 2Wiki (+0.256), benefiting from improvements in the reasoning process.</p></details> |  |

Such documents often combine text, images, tables, equations, and graphs, each contributing unique information. In this work, we present a Modality-Aware Hybrid retrieval Architecture (MAHA), designed specifically for multimodal question answering with reasoning through a modality-aware knowledge graph. MAHA integrates dense vector retrieval with structured graph traversal, where the knowledge graph encodes cross-modal semantics and relationships. This design enables both semantically rich and context-aware retrieval across diverse modalities. Evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that MAHA substantially outperforms baseline methods, achieving a ROUGE-L score of 0.486, providing complete modality coverage. These results highlight MAHA's ability to combine embeddings with explicit document structure, enabling effective multimodal retrieval. Our work establishes a scalable and interpretable retrieval framework that advances RAG systems by enabling modality-aware reasoning over unstructured multimodal data.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, submitted for review</p></details> |

Nevertheless, existing methods often struggle to achieve effective synergy between system effectiveness and cost efficiency, leading to neither unsatisfying performance nor excessive LLM prompt tokens and inference time. To this end, this paper proposes REMINDRAG, which employs an LLM-guided graph traversal featuring node exploration, node exploitation, and, most notably, memory replay, to improve both system effectiveness and cost efficiency. Specifically, REMINDRAG memorizes traversal experience within KG edge embeddings, mirroring the way LLMs "memorize" world knowledge within their parameters, but in a train-free manner. We theoretically and experimentally confirm the effectiveness of REMINDRAG, demonstrating its superiority over existing baselines across various benchmark datasets and LLM backbones.

Existing methods either use a predetermined number of iterations or rely on confidence proxies that poorly reflect whether more retrieval will actually help. We cast iterative RAG as a finite-horizon Markov decision process and introduce Stop-RAG, a value-based controller that adaptively decides when to stop retrieving. Trained with full-width forward-view Q($\lambda$) targets from complete trajectories, Stop-RAG learns effective stopping policies while remaining compatible with black-box APIs and existing pipelines. On multi-hop question-answering benchmarks, Stop-RAG consistently outperforms both fixed-iteration baselines and prompting-based stopping with LLMs. These results highlight adaptive stopping as a key missing component in current agentic systems, and demonstrate that value-based control can improve the accuracy of RAG systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 MTI-LLM Workshop</p></details> |
| **[RAG Meets Temporal Graphs: Time-Sensitive Modeling and Retrieval for Evolving Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13590v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge is inherently time-sensitive and continuously evolves over time. Although current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enrich LLMs with external knowledge, they largely ignore this temporal nature. This raises two challenges for RAG. First, current RAG methods lack effective time-aware representations. Same facts of different time are difficult to distinguish with vector embeddings or conventional knowledge graphs. Second, most RAG evaluations assume a static corpus, leaving a blind spot regarding update costs and retrieval stability as knowledge evolves. To make RAG time-aware, we propose Temporal GraphRAG (TG-RAG), which models external corpora as a bi-level temporal graph consisting of a temporal knowledge graph with timestamped relations and a hierarchical time graph. Multi-granularity temporal summaries are generated for each time node to capture both key events and broader trends at that time. The design supports incremental updates by extracting new temporal facts from the incoming corpus and merging them into the existing graph. The temporal graph explicitly represents identical facts at different times as distinct edges to avoid ambiguity, and the time hierarchy graph allows only generating reports for new leaf time nodes and their ancestors, ensuring effective and efficient updates. During inference, TG-RAG dynamically retrieves a subgraph within the temporal and semantic scope of the query, enabling precise evidence gathering. Moreover, we introduce ECT-QA, a time-sensitive question-answering dataset featuring both specific and abstract queries, along with a comprehensive evaluation protocol designed to assess incremental update capabilities of RAG systems. Extensive experiments show that TG-RAG significantly outperforms existing baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in handling temporal knowledge and incremental updates.</p></details> |  |
| **[SeCon-RAG: A Two-Stage Semantic Filtering and Conflict-Free Framework for Trustworthy RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09710v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems enhance large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge but are vulnerable to corpus poisoning and contamination attacks, which can compromise output integrity. Existing defenses often apply aggressive filtering, leading to unnecessary loss of valuable information and reduced reliability in generation. To address this problem, we propose a two-stage semantic filtering and conflict-free framework for trustworthy RAG. In the first stage, we perform a joint filter with semantic and cluster-based filtering which is guided by the Entity-intent-relation extractor (EIRE). EIRE extracts entities, latent objectives, and entity relations from both the user query and filtered documents, scores their semantic relevance, and selectively adds valuable documents into the clean retrieval database. In the second stage, we proposed an EIRE-guided conflict-aware filtering module, which analyzes semantic consistency between the query, candidate answers, and retrieved knowledge before final answer generation, filtering out internal and external contradictions that could mislead the model. Through this two-stage process, SeCon-RAG effectively preserves useful knowledge while mitigating conflict contamination, achieving significant improvements in both generation robustness and output trustworthiness. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and datasets demonstrate that the proposed SeCon-RAG markedly outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[RAG-Anything: All-in-One RAG Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12323v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a fundamental paradigm for expanding Large Language Models beyond their static training limitations. However, a critical misalignment exists between current RAG capabilities and real-world information environments. Modern knowledge repositories are inherently multimodal, containing rich combinations of textual content, visual elements, structured tables, and mathematical expressions. Yet existing RAG frameworks are limited to textual content, creating fundamental gaps when processing multimodal documents. We present RAG-Anything, a unified framework that enables comprehensive knowledge retrieval across all modalities. Our approach reconceptualizes multimodal content as interconnected knowledge entities rather than isolated data types. The framework introduces dual-graph construction to capture both cross-modal relationships and textual semantics within a unified representation. We develop cross-modal hybrid retrieval that combines structural knowledge navigation with semantic matching. This enables effective reasoning over heterogeneous content where relevant evidence spans multiple modalities. RAG-Anything demonstrates superior performance on challenging multimodal benchmarks, achieving significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Performance gains become particularly pronounced on long documents where traditional approaches fail. Our framework establishes a new paradigm for multimodal knowledge access, eliminating the architectural fragmentation that constrains current systems. Our framework is open-sourced at: https://github.com/HKUDS/RAG-Anything.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beating Harmful Stereotypes Through Facts: RAG-based Counter-speech Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12316v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Counter-speech generation is at the core of many expert activities, such as fact-checking and hate speech, to counter harmful content. Yet, existing work treats counter-speech generation as pure text generation task, mainly based on Large Language Models or NGO experts. These approaches show severe drawbacks due to the limited reliability and coherence in the generated countering text, and in scalability, respectively. To close this gap, we introduce a novel framework to model counter-speech generation as knowledge-wise text generation process. Our framework integrates advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines to ensure the generation of trustworthy counter-speech for 8 main target groups identified in the hate speech literature, including women, people of colour, persons with disabilities, migrants, Muslims, Jews, LGBT persons, and other. We built a knowledge base over the United Nations Digital Library, EUR-Lex and the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights, comprising a total of 32,792 texts. We use the MultiTarget-CONAN dataset to empirically assess the quality of the generated counter-speech, both through standard metrics (i.e., JudgeLM) and a human evaluation. Results show that our framework outperforms standard LLM baselines and competitive approach, on both assessments. The resulting framework and the knowledge base pave the way for studying trustworthy and sound counter-speech generation, in hate speech and beyond.</p></details> |  |

Yet, RAG-based LLMs still hallucinate even when provided with correct and sufficient context. A growing line of work suggests that this stems from an imbalance between how models use external context and their internal knowledge, and several approaches have attempted to quantify these signals for hallucination detection. However, existing methods require extensive hyperparameter tuning, limiting their generalizability. We propose LUMINA, a novel framework that detects hallucinations in RAG systems through context-knowledge signals: external context utilization is quantified via distributional distance, while internal knowledge utilization is measured by tracking how predicted tokens evolve across transformer layers. We further introduce a framework for statistically validating these measurements. Experiments on common RAG hallucination benchmarks and four open-source LLMs show that LUMINA achieves consistently high AUROC and AUPRC scores, outperforming prior utilization-based methods by up to +13% AUROC on HalluRAG. Moreover, LUMINA remains robust under relaxed assumptions about retrieval quality and model matching, offering both effectiveness and practicality.</p></details> |  |

Several benchmarks have been created to measure the performance of LLMs on this task. We present a longitudinal study comparing the feedback loop of an internal and external human annotator group for the complex annotation task of creating multi-turn RAG conversations for evaluating LLMs. We analyze the conversations produced by both groups and provide results of a survey comparing their experiences. Our study highlights the advantages of each annotator population and the impact of the different feedback loops; a closer loop creates higher quality conversations with a decrease in quantity and diversity. Further, we present guidance for how to best utilize two different population groups when performing annotation tasks, particularly when the task is complex.</p></details> | 26 pages |

Most existing approaches lack transparency in their decision-making and provide limited attribution to credible sources. We introduce FinVet, a novel multi-agent framework that integrates two Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines with external fact-checking through a confidence-weighted voting mechanism. FinVet employs adaptive three-tier processing that dynamically adjusts verification strategies based on retrieval confidence, from direct metadata extraction to hybrid reasoning to full model-based analysis. Unlike existing methods, FinVet provides evidence-backed verdicts, source attribution, confidence scores, and explicit uncertainty flags when evidence is insufficient. Experimental evaluation on the FinFact dataset shows that FinVet achieves an F1 score of 0.85, which is a 10.4% improvement over the best individual pipeline (fact-check pipeline) and 37% improvement over standalone RAG approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Domain-Specific Data Generation Framework for RAG Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11217v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the language understanding and reasoning power of large language models (LLMs) with external retrieval to enable domain-grounded responses. Effectively adapting RAG systems to domain-specific settings requires specialized, context-rich training data beyond general-purpose question-answering. Here, we propose RAGen, a scalable and modular framework for generating domain-grounded question-answer-context (QAC) triples tailored to diverse RAG adaptation approaches. RAGen produces these QAC triples by identifying key concepts in documents, generating diverse questions guided by Bloom's Taxonomy-inspired principles, and pairing them with precise answers extracted from relevant contexts. RAGen supports multiple RAG adaptation strategies, including the optimization of key components such as the LLM, retriever, and embedding model, etc. Its modular pipeline features semantic chunking, hierarchical concept extraction, and multi-chunk retrieval, along with the introduction of curated distractor contexts to promote robust reasoning. Designed for scalability, RAGen efficiently handles large and evolving document corpora without redundant processing, making it especially suitable for dynamic evolving domains such as scientific research and enterprise knowledge bases.</p></details> |  |

It does so by adding external data into the LLM's context. We develop a new class of black-box attack, RAG-Pull, that inserts hidden UTF characters into queries or external code repositories, redirecting retrieval toward malicious code, thereby breaking the models' safety alignment. We observe that query and code perturbations alone can shift retrieval toward attacker-controlled snippets, while combined query-and-target perturbations achieve near-perfect success. Once retrieved, these snippets introduce exploitable vulnerabilities such as remote code execution and SQL injection. RAG-Pull's minimal perturbations can alter the model's safety alignment and increase preference towards unsafe code, therefore opening up a new class of attacks on LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Retrievalaugmented generation (RAG) methods aim to address this challenge by selectively retrieving only necessary document segments. However, narrative texts possess unique characteristics that limit the effectiveness of these existing approaches. Specifically, understanding narrative texts requires more than isolated segments, as the broader context and sequential relationships between segments are crucial for comprehension. To address these limitations, we propose ChronoRAG, a novel RAG framework specialized for narrative texts. This approach focuses on two essential aspects: refining dispersed document information into coherent and structured passages and preserving narrative flow by explicitly capturing and maintaining the temporal order among retrieved passages. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of ChronoRAG through experiments on the NarrativeQA and GutenQAdataset, showing substantial improvements in tasks requiring both factual identification and comprehension of complex sequential relationships, underscoring that reasoning over temporal order is crucial in resolving narrative QA.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |

However, these models can inadvertently learn and retain sensitive information and harmful content during training, raising significant ethical and legal concerns. To address these issues, machine unlearning has been introduced as a potential solution. While existing unlearning methods take into account the specific characteristics of LLMs, they often suffer from high computational demands, limited applicability, or the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address these limitations, we propose a lightweight behavioral unlearning framework based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology. By modifying the external knowledge base of RAG, we simulate the effects of forgetting without directly interacting with the unlearned LLM. We approach the construction of unlearned knowledge as a constrained optimization problem, deriving two key components that underpin the effectiveness of RAG-based unlearning. This RAG-based approach is particularly effective for closed-source LLMs, where existing unlearning methods often fail. We evaluate our framework through extensive experiments on both open-source and closed-source models, including ChatGPT, Gemini, Llama-2-7b-chat, and PaLM 2. The results demonstrate that our approach meets five key unlearning criteria: effectiveness, universality, harmlessness, simplicity, and robustness. Meanwhile, this approach can extend to multimodal large language models and LLM-based agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, 13 tables.

However, existing financial RAG systems face two significant challenges: (1) they struggle to process heterogeneous data formats, such as text, tables, and figures; and (2) they encounter difficulties in balancing general-domain applicability with company-specific adaptation. To overcome these challenges, we present VeritasFi, an innovative hybrid RAG framework that incorporates a multi-modal preprocessing pipeline alongside a cutting-edge two-stage training strategy for its re-ranking component. VeritasFi enhances financial QA through three key innovations: (1) A multi-modal preprocessing pipeline that seamlessly transforms heterogeneous data into a coherent, machine-readable format. (2) A tripartite hybrid retrieval engine that operates in parallel, combining deep multi-path retrieval over a semantically indexed document corpus, real-time data acquisition through tool utilization, and an expert-curated memory bank for high-frequency questions, ensuring comprehensive scope, accuracy, and efficiency. (3) A two-stage training strategy for the document re-ranker, which initially constructs a general, domain-specific model using anonymized data, followed by rapid fine-tuning on company-specific data for targeted applications. By integrating our proposed designs, VeritasFi presents a groundbreaking framework that greatly enhances the adaptability and robustness of financial RAG systems, providing a scalable solution for both general-domain and company-specific QA tasks.

| **[Review of Inference-Time Scaling Strategies: Reasoning, Search and RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10787v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance gains of LLMs have historically been driven by scaling up model size and training data. However, the rapidly diminishing availability of high-quality training data is introducing a fundamental bottleneck, shifting the focus of research toward inference-time scaling. This paradigm uses additional computation at the time of deployment to substantially improve LLM performance on downstream tasks without costly model re-training. This review systematically surveys the diverse techniques contributing to this new era of inference-time scaling, organizing the rapidly evolving field into two comprehensive perspectives: Output-focused and Input-focused methods. Output-focused techniques encompass complex, multi-step generation strategies, including reasoning (e.g., CoT, ToT, ReAct), various search and decoding methods (e.g., MCTS, beam search), training for long CoT (e.g., RLVR, GRPO), and model ensemble methods. Input-focused techniques are primarily categorized by few-shot and RAG, with RAG as the central focus. The RAG section is further detailed through a structured examination of query expansion, data, retrieval and reranker, LLM generation methods, and multi-modal RAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[REFRAG: Rethinking RAG based Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01092v2)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in leveraging extensive external knowledge to enhance responses in multi-turn and agentic applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, processing long-context inputs introduces significant system latency and demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced throughput and a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system efficiency. While minimizing latency for long-context inputs is a primary objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG require specialized consideration. In RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated passages from retrieval, with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages often exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during re-ranking, leading to block-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those in standard LLM generation tasks. Based on this observation, we argue that most computations over the RAG context during decoding are unnecessary and can be eliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose REFRAG, an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve latency in RAG applications. By exploiting the sparsity structure, we demonstrate a 30.85 the time-to-first-token acceleration (3.75 improvement to previous work) without loss in perplexity. In addition, our optimization framework for large context enables REFRAG to extend the context size of LLMs by 16. We provide rigorous validation of REFRAG across diverse long-context tasks, including RAG, multi-turn conversations, and long document summarization, spanning a wide range of datasets. Experimental results confirm that REFRAG delivers substantial speedup with no loss in accuracy compared to LLaMA models and other state-of-the-art baselines across various context sizes.</p></details> | <details><summary>fix t...</summary><p>fix typo perplexity->log perplexity; added recent papers</p></details> |

We develop a multimodal retrieval model jointly optimized with an LVLM for medical diagnosis, unlike standard RAG which doesn't backpropagate LVLM errors to the retriever. Using only general-purpose backbones with lightweight fine-tuning, our model achieves competitive results with medically-pretrained models on clinical classification and VQA tasks. In a novel analysis, we find that different top-retrieved images often yield different predictions for the same target, and that these cases are challenging for all models, even for non-retrieval models. Our joint retrieval optimization significantly improves these cases over standard RAG. However, oracle analysis reveals that while the correct diagnosis is frequently achievable using one of the top retrieved images, in practice there is a large performance gap from the oracle, and rerankers using frontier LVLMs do not close this gap -- leaving ample room for improvement by future methods.

Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization for Preserving Agentic RAG Capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20324v3)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a dominant post-training approach to elicit agentic RAG behaviors such as search and planning from language models. Despite its success with larger models, applying RL to compact models (e.g., 0.5--1B parameters) presents unique challenges. The compact models exhibit poor initial performance, resulting in sparse rewards and unstable training. To overcome these difficulties, we propose Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization (DGPO), which employs cold-start initialization from teacher demonstrations and continuous teacher guidance during policy optimization. To understand how compact models preserve agentic behavior, we introduce Agentic RAG Capabilities (ARC), a fine-grained metric analyzing reasoning, search coordination, and response synthesis. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that DGPO enables compact models to achieve sophisticated agentic search behaviors, even outperforming the larger teacher model in some cases. DGPO makes agentic RAG feasible in computing resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  |

Prior work highlights LLMs' susceptibility to misleading or malicious retrieved content. However, real-world fact-checking scenarios are more challenging, as credible evidence typically dominates the retrieval pool. To investigate this problem, we extend knowledge poisoning to the fact-checking setting, where retrieved context includes authentic supporting or refuting evidence. We propose \textbf{ADMIT} (\textbf{AD}versarial \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{I}njection \textbf{T}echnique), a few-shot, semantically aligned poisoning attack that flips fact-checking decisions and induces deceptive justifications, all without access to the target LLMs, retrievers, or token-level control. Extensive experiments show that ADMIT transfers effectively across 4 retrievers, 11 LLMs, and 4 cross-domain benchmarks, achieving an average attack success rate (ASR) of 86\% at an extremely low poisoning rate of $0.93 \times 10^{-6}$, and remaining robust even in the presence of strong counter-evidence. Compared with prior state-of-the-art attacks, ADMIT improves ASR by 11.2\% across all settings, exposing significant vulnerabilities in real-world RAG-based fact-checking systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[CacheClip: Accelerating RAG with Effective KV Cache Reuse](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10129v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems suffer from severe time-to-first-token (TTFT) bottlenecks due to long input sequences. Existing KV cache reuse methods face a fundamental trade-off: prefix caching requires identical prefixes that rarely occur in RAG scenarios, while direct precomputation sacrifices quality due to missing inter-chunk attention and repeated attention sinks. Recent methods like APE and CacheBlend partially address these issues but remain inadequate for robust RAG applications. This paper presents CacheClip, a novel framework that achieves both fast TTFT and high generation quality. Our key insight is that small auxiliary LLMs exhibit similar last-layer attention distributions to primary LLMs (the target model for generation), enabling efficient identification of tokens critical for restoring inter-chunk attention, thereby significantly improving response quality on cross-chunk reasoning tasks. CacheClip integrates three techniques: (1) auxiliary-model-guided token selection for selective KV cache recomputation, where the auxiliary model is finetuned to improve selection accuracy, (2) shared prefixes to eliminate redundant attention sinks, and (3) grouping strategy to maintain local coherence during partial KV cache updates. Experiments show CacheClip retains up to 94.8% and 85.0% of full-attention performance on NIAH and LongBench, outperforming APE and CacheBlend by 25.2% and 35.1% on NIAH (with reomp% = 20%). Meanwhile, CacheClip accelerates LLM inference by up to 1.92x in prefill time, providing a practical solution to the efficiency-quality trade-off in RAG systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transparent and Robust RAG: Adaptive-Reward Reinforcement Learning for Decision Traceability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13258v2)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) delivers substantial value in knowledge-intensive applications. Many recent works use reinforcement learning (RL) to elicit strong reasoning in RAG generators. However, two key challenges remain unresolved: (1) Transparency: most prior methods do not explicitly indicate which references are actually used during the reasoning that leads to the final answer, limiting interpretability and visibility; (2) Stability: the KL divergence estimator used in existing RL-based approaches may cause gradient spikes, leading to unstable training. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive-Rewarded Evidence Navigation Agent (ARENA), a transparent and robust RAG generator framework trained via RL with designed rewards. Based on our structured protocol, KL divergence stabilization, and adaptive reward calculation modules, ARENA enables the RAG generator to identify key evidence, perform structured reasoning, and generate answers with interpretable decision traces. Applied to Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, extensive experiments across multiple baselines show 10-30% accuracy improvements on three multi-hop QA datasets, comparable to advanced closed-source LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o1, DeepSeek R1). Further analyses show that ARENA generalizes well to unseen datasets and tasks. Our models and codes are publicly released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retrieval is Not Enough: Enhancing RAG Reasoning through Test-Time Critique and Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14858v4)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a widely adopted paradigm for enabling knowledge-grounded large language models (LLMs). However, standard RAG pipelines often fail to ensure that model reasoning remains consistent with the evidence retrieved, leading to factual inconsistencies or unsupported conclusions. In this work, we reinterpret RAG as Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning and identify a central but underexplored problem: Reasoning Misalignment -- the divergence between an LLM's internal reasoning trajectory and the evidential constraints provided by retrieval. To address this issue, we propose AlignRAG, a novel iterative framework grounded in Critique-Driven Alignment (CDA). We further introduce AlignRAG-auto, an autonomous variant that dynamically terminates refinement, removing the need to pre-specify the number of critique iterations. At the heart of AlignRAG lies a contrastive critique synthesis mechanism that generates retrieval-sensitive critiques while mitigating self-bias. This mechanism trains a dedicated retrieval-augmented Critic Language Model (CLM) using labeled critiques that distinguish between evidence-aligned and misaligned reasoning. Empirical evaluations show that our approach significantly improves reasoning fidelity. Our 8B-parameter CLM improves performance over the Self-Refine baseline by 12.1% on out-of-domain tasks and outperforms a standard 72B-parameter CLM by 2.2%. Furthermore, AlignRAG-auto achieves this state-of-the-art performance while dynamically determining the optimal number of refinement steps, enhancing efficiency and usability. AlignRAG remains compatible with existing RAG architectures as a plug-and-play module and demonstrates strong robustness under both informative and noisy retrieval scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[EcphoryRAG: Re-Imagining Knowledge-Graph RAG via Human Associative Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08958v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cognitive neuroscience research indicates that humans leverage cues to activate entity-centered memory traces (engrams) for complex, multi-hop recollection. Inspired by this mechanism, we introduce EcphoryRAG, an entity-centric knowledge graph RAG framework. During indexing, EcphoryRAG extracts and stores only core entities with corresponding metadata, a lightweight approach that reduces token consumption by up to 94\% compared to other structured RAG systems. For retrieval, the system first extracts cue entities from queries, then performs a scalable multi-hop associative search across the knowledge graph. Crucially, EcphoryRAG dynamically infers implicit relations between entities to populate context, enabling deep reasoning without exhaustive pre-enumeration of relationships. Extensive evaluations on the 2WikiMultiHop, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue benchmarks demonstrate that EcphoryRAG sets a new state-of-the-art, improving the average Exact Match (EM) score from 0.392 to 0.474 over strong KG-RAG methods like HippoRAG. These results validate the efficacy of the entity-cue-multi-hop retrieval paradigm for complex question answering.</p></details> |  |
| **[UNIDOC-BENCH: A Unified Benchmark for Document-Centric Multimodal RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03663v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (MM-RAG) is a key approach for applying large language models (LLMs) and agents to real-world knowledge bases, yet current evaluations are fragmented, focusing on either text or images in isolation or on simplified multimodal setups that fail to capture document-centric multimodal use cases. In this paper, we introduce UniDoc-Bench, the first large-scale, realistic benchmark for MM-RAG built from 70k real-world PDF pages across eight domains. Our pipeline extracts and links evidence from text, tables, and figures, then generates 1,600 multimodal QA pairs spanning factual retrieval, comparison, summarization, and logical reasoning queries. To ensure reliability, 20% of QA pairs are validated by multiple annotators and expert adjudication. UniDoc-Bench supports apples-to-apples comparison across four paradigms: (1) text-only, (2) image-only, (3) multimodal text-image fusion, and (4) multimodal joint retrieval -- under a unified protocol with standardized candidate pools, prompts, and evaluation metrics. Our experiments show that multimodal text-image fusion RAG systems consistently outperform both unimodal and jointly multimodal embedding-based retrieval, indicating that neither text nor images alone are sufficient and that current multimodal embeddings remain inadequate. Beyond benchmarking, our analysis reveals when and how visual context complements textual evidence, uncovers systematic failure modes, and offers actionable guidance for developing more robust MM-RAG pipelines.</p></details> |  |

A Method for Detecting Unauthorized RAG Theft](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07728v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by mitigating hallucinations and outdated information issues, yet simultaneously facilitates unauthorized data appropriation at scale. This paper addresses this challenge through two key contributions. First, we introduce RPD, a novel dataset specifically designed for RAG plagiarism detection that encompasses diverse professional domains and writing styles, overcoming limitations in existing resources. Second, we develop a dual-layered watermarking system that embeds protection at both semantic and lexical levels, complemented by an interrogator-detective framework that employs statistical hypothesis testing on accumulated evidence. Extensive experimentation demonstrates our approach's effectiveness across varying query volumes, defense prompts, and retrieval parameters, while maintaining resilience against adversarial evasion techniques. This work establishes a foundational framework for intellectual property protection in retrieval-augmented AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient and Transferable Agentic Knowledge Graph RAG via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26383v3)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge-graph retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) couples large language models (LLMs) with structured, verifiable knowledge graphs (KGs) to reduce hallucinations and expose reasoning traces. However, many KG-RAG systems compose multiple LLM modules (e.g planning, reasoning, and responding), inflating inference cost and binding behavior to a specific target KG. To address this, we introduce KG-R1, an agentic KG retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) framework through reinforcement learning (RL). KG-R1 utilizes a single agent that interacts with KGs as its environment, learning to retrieve at each step and incorporating the retrieved information into its reasoning and generation. The process is optimized through end-to-end RL. In controlled experiments across Knowledge-Graph Question Answering (KGQA) benchmarks, our method demonstrates both efficiency and transferability: Using Qwen-2.5-3B, KG-R1 improves answer accuracy with fewer generation tokens than prior multi-module workflow methods that use larger foundation or fine-tuned models. Furthermore, KG-R1 enables plug and play: after training, it maintains strong accuracy on new KGs without modification. These properties make KG-R1 a promising KG-RAG framework for real-world deployment. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Jinyeop3110/KG-R1.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures. Submitted to ICLR 2026</p></details> |

However, conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods encode content in isolated chunks during ingestion, losing structural and cross-page dependencies, and retrieve a fixed number of pages at inference, regardless of the specific demands of the question or context. This often results in incomplete evidence retrieval and degraded answer quality for multi-page reasoning tasks. To address these limitations, we propose LAD-RAG, a novel Layout-Aware Dynamic RAG framework. During ingestion, LAD-RAG constructs a symbolic document graph that captures layout structure and cross-page dependencies, adding it alongside standard neural embeddings to yield a more holistic representation of the document. During inference, an LLM agent dynamically interacts with the neural and symbolic indices to adaptively retrieve the necessary evidence based on the query. Experiments on MMLongBench-Doc, LongDocURL, DUDE, and MP-DocVQA demonstrate that LAD-RAG improves retrieval, achieving over 90% perfect recall on average without any top-k tuning, and outperforming baseline retrievers by up to 20% in recall at comparable noise levels, yielding higher QA accuracy with minimal latency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Reliable Retrieval in RAG Systems for Large Legal Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06999v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a promising approach to mitigate hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) for legal applications, but its reliability is critically dependent on the accuracy of the retrieval step. This is particularly challenging in the legal domain, where large databases of structurally similar documents often cause retrieval systems to fail. In this paper, we address this challenge by first identifying and quantifying a critical failure mode we term Document-Level Retrieval Mismatch (DRM), where the retriever selects information from entirely incorrect source documents. To mitigate DRM, we investigate a simple and computationally efficient technique which we refer to as Summary-Augmented Chunking (SAC). This method enhances each text chunk with a document-level synthetic summary, thereby injecting crucial global context that would otherwise be lost during a standard chunking process. Our experiments on a diverse set of legal information retrieval tasks show that SAC greatly reduces DRM and, consequently, also improves text-level retrieval precision and recall. Interestingly, we find that a generic summarization strategy outperforms an approach that incorporates legal expert domain knowledge to target specific legal elements. Our work provides evidence that this practical, scalable, and easily integrable technique enhances the reliability of RAG systems when applied to large-scale legal document datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for the 7th Natural Legal Language Processing Workshop (NLLP 2025), co-located with EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

However, its application in sensitive domains is limited by privacy risks. Existing private RAG methods typically rely on query-time differential privacy (DP), which requires repeated noise injection and leads to accumulated privacy loss. To address this issue, we propose DP-SynRAG, a framework that uses LLMs to generate differentially private synthetic RAG databases. Unlike prior methods, the synthetic text can be reused once created, thereby avoiding repeated noise injection and additional privacy costs. To preserve essential information for downstream RAG tasks, DP-SynRAG extends private prediction, which instructs LLMs to generate text that mimics subsampled database records in a DP manner. Experiments show that DP-SynRAG achieves superior performanec to the state-of-the-art private RAG systems while maintaining a fixed privacy budget, offering a scalable solution for privacy-preserving RAG.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[MM-PoisonRAG: Disrupting Multimodal RAG with Local and Global Poisoning Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17832v3)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) have significantly advanced tasks such as multimodal question answering by grounding responses in external text and images. This grounding improves factuality, reduces hallucination, and extends reasoning beyond parametric knowledge. However, this reliance on external knowledge poses a critical yet underexplored safety risk: knowledge poisoning attacks, where adversaries deliberately inject adversarial multimodal content into external knowledge bases to steer model toward generating incorrect or even harmful responses. To expose such vulnerabilities, we propose MM-PoisonRAG, the first framework to systematically design knowledge poisoning in multimodal RAG. We introduce two complementary attack strategies: Localized Poisoning Attack (LPA), which implants targeted multimodal misinformation to manipulate specific queries, and Globalized Poisoning Attack (GPA), which inserts a single adversarial knowledge to broadly disrupt reasoning and induce nonsensical responses across all queries. Comprehensive experiments across tasks, models, and access settings show that LPA achieves targeted manipulation with attack success rates of up to 56%, while GPA completely disrupts model generation to 0% accuracy with just a single adversarial knowledge injection. Our results reveal the fragility of multimodal RAG and highlight the urgent need for defenses against knowledge poisoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/HyeonjeongHa/MM-PoisonRAG</p></details> |

It leverages graphs to model the hierarchical structure between specific concepts, enabling more coherent and effective knowledge retrieval for accurate reasoning.Despite its conceptual promise, recent studies report that GraphRAG frequently underperforms vanilla RAG on many real-world tasks. This raises a critical question: Is GraphRAG really effective, and in which scenarios do graph structures provide measurable benefits for RAG systems? To address this, we propose GraphRAG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate GraphRAG models onboth hierarchical knowledge retrieval and deep contextual reasoning. GraphRAG-Bench features a comprehensive dataset with tasks of increasing difficulty, coveringfact retrieval, complex reasoning, contextual summarization, and creative generation, and a systematic evaluation across the entire pipeline, from graph constructionand knowledge retrieval to final generation.

However, existing approaches underutilize the inherent knowledge of large language models (LLMs), leading to suboptimal retrieval decisions and degraded generation performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Self-Routing RAG (SR-RAG), a novel framework that binds selective retrieval with knowledge verbalization. SR-RAG enables an LLM to dynamically decide whether to retrieve external knowledge or verbalize its own parametric knowledge. To this end, we design a multi-task objective that jointly optimizes an LLM for knowledge source selection, knowledge verbalization, and response generation. SR-RAG further incorporates a nearest neighbor search mechanism at inference time to improve the accuracy of knowledge source decisions under domain shifts. Fine-tuning three LLMs with SR-RAG significantly improves both their response accuracy and reduces the inference latency. Compared to the strongest selective retrieval baseline, SR-RAG reduces the number of retrievals by 29% while improving performance by 5.1%.</p></details> |  |

Using the Operations and Maintenance Intelligence (OMIn) dataset, we construct a QA benchmark spanning global sensemaking and actionable maintenance tasks. KEO builds a structured Knowledge Graph (KG) and integrates it into a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, enabling more coherent, dataset-wide reasoning than traditional text-chunk RAG. We evaluate locally deployable LLMs (Gemma-3, Phi-4, Mistral-Nemo) and employ stronger models (GPT-4o, Llama-3.3) as judges. Experiments show that KEO markedly improves global sensemaking by revealing patterns and system-level insights, while text-chunk RAG remains effective for fine-grained procedural tasks requiring localized retrieval. These findings underscore the promise of KG-augmented LLMs for secure, domain-specific QA and their potential in high-stakes reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAG Makes Guardrails Unsafe? Investigating Robustness of Guardrails under RAG-style Contexts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05310v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs), ensuring the safety of LLM systems has become a pressing concern. External LLM-based guardrail models have emerged as a popular solution to screen unsafe inputs and outputs, but they are themselves fine-tuned or prompt-engineered LLMs that are vulnerable to data distribution shifts. In this paper, taking Retrieval Augmentation Generation (RAG) as a case study, we investigated how robust LLM-based guardrails are against additional information embedded in the context. Through a systematic evaluation of 3 Llama Guards and 2 GPT-oss models, we confirmed that inserting benign documents into the guardrail context alters the judgments of input and output guardrails in around 11% and 8% of cases, making them unreliable. We separately analyzed the effect of each component in the augmented context: retrieved documents, user query, and LLM-generated response. The two mitigation methods we tested only bring minor improvements. These results expose a context-robustness gap in current guardrails and motivate training and evaluation protocols that are robust to retrieval and query composition.</p></details> |  |
| **[ModernBERT + ColBERT: Enhancing biomedical RAG through an advanced re-ranking retriever](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04757v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique for enriching Large Language Models (LLMs) with external knowledge, allowing for factually grounded responses, a critical requirement in high-stakes domains such as healthcare. However, the efficacy of RAG systems is fundamentally restricted by the performance of their retrieval module, since irrelevant or semantically misaligned documents directly compromise the accuracy of the final generated response. General-purpose dense retrievers can struggle with the nuanced language of specialised domains, while the high accuracy of in-domain models is often achieved at prohibitive computational costs. In this work, we aim to address this trade-off by developing and evaluating a two-stage retrieval architecture that combines a lightweight ModernBERT bidirectional encoder for efficient initial candidate retrieval with a ColBERTv2 late-interaction model for fine-grained re-ranking. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of our retriever module performance and RAG system performance in the biomedical context, fine-tuning the IR module using 10k question-passage pairs from PubMedQA. Our analysis of the retriever module confirmed the positive impact of the ColBERT re-ranker, which improved Recall@3 by up to 4.2 percentage points compared to its retrieve-only counterpart. When integrated into the biomedical RAG, our IR module leads to a state-of-the-art average accuracy of 0.4448 on the five tasks of the MIRAGE question-answering benchmark, outperforming strong baselines such as MedCPT (0.4436). Our ablation studies reveal that this performance is critically dependent on a joint fine-tuning process that aligns the retriever and re-ranker; otherwise, the re-ranker might degrade the performance.</p></details> |  |

The framework enables users to generate 3D-CG content solely through natural language instructions. 3Dify is built upon Dify, an open-source platform for AI application development, and incorporates several state-of-the-art LLM-related technologies such as the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). For 3D-CG generation support, 3Dify automates the operation of various Digital Content Creation (DCC) tools via MCP. When DCC tools do not support MCP-based interaction, the framework employs the Computer-Using Agent (CUA) method to automate Graphical User Interface (GUI) operations. Moreover, to enhance image generation quality, 3Dify allows users to provide feedback by selecting preferred images from multiple candidates. The LLM then learns variable patterns from these selections and applies them to subsequent generations. Furthermore, 3Dify supports the integration of locally deployed LLMs, enabling users to utilize custom-developed models and to reduce both time and monetary costs associated with external API calls by leveraging their own computational resources.</p></details> |  |

While scaling generators improves accuracy, it also raises cost and limits deployability. We explore an orthogonal axis: enlarging the retriever's corpus to reduce reliance on large LLMs. Experimental results show that corpus scaling consistently strengthens RAG and can often serve as a substitute for increasing model size, though with diminishing returns at larger scales. Small- and mid-sized generators paired with larger corpora often rival much larger models with smaller corpora; mid-sized models tend to gain the most, while tiny and large models benefit less. Our analysis shows that improvements arise primarily from increased coverage of answer-bearing passages, while utilization efficiency remains largely unchanged. These findings establish a principled corpus-generator trade-off: investing in larger corpora offers an effective path to stronger RAG, often comparable to enlarging the LLM itself.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) provide opportunities to automate safety inspections through enhanced visual and linguistic understanding. However, existing applications face limitations including irrelevant or unspecific responses, restricted modal inputs and hallucinations. Utilisation of Large Language Models (LLMs) for this purpose is constrained by availability of training data and frequently lack real-time adaptability. This study introduces SiteShield, a multi-modal LVLM-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for automating construction safety inspection reports by integrating visual and audio inputs. Using real-world data, SiteShield outperformed unimodal LLMs without RAG with an F1 score of 0.82, hamming loss of 0.04, precision of 0.76, and recall of 0.96.

In real-world scenarios, beyond pure text, a substantial amount of knowledge is stored in tables, and user questions often require retrieving answers that are distributed across multiple tables. Retrieving knowledge from a table corpora (i.e., various individual tables) for a question remains nascent, at least, for (i) how to understand intra- and inter-table knowledge effectively, (ii) how to filter unnecessary tables and how to retrieve the most relevant tables efficiently, (iii) how to prompt LLMs to infer over the retrieval, (iv) how to evaluate the corresponding performance in a realistic setting. Facing the above challenges, in this paper, we first propose a table-corpora-aware RAG framework, named T-RAG, which consists of the hierarchical memory index, multi-stage retrieval, and graph-aware prompting for effective and efficient table knowledge retrieval and inference. Further, we first develop a multi-table question answering benchmark named MultiTableQA, which spans 3 different task types, 57,193 tables, and 23,758 questions in total, and the sources are all from real-world scenarios. Based on MultiTableQA, we did the holistic comparison over table retrieval methods, RAG methods, and table-to-graph representation learning methods, where T-RAG shows the leading accuracy, recall, and running time performance.

When applying reasoning in specialized contexts with LLMs on top of a RAG, the pipeline can capture contextually relevant information, but it is not designed to retrieve comparable cases or related problems. While RAG is effective at extracting factual information, its outputs in specialized reasoning tasks often remain generic, reflecting broad facts rather than context-specific insights. In finance, it results in generic risks that are true for the majority of companies. To address this limitation, we propose a peer-aware comparative inference layer on top of RAG.

It adversely affects performance on downstream tasks such as question answering (QA). Existing approaches often attempt to mitigate conflicts by directly comparing two knowledge sources in a side-by-side manner, but this can overwhelm LLMs with extraneous or lengthy contexts, ultimately hindering their ability to identify and mitigate inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose Micro-Act a framework with a hierarchical action space that automatically perceives context complexity and adaptively decomposes each knowledge source into a sequence of fine-grained comparisons. These comparisons are represented as actionable steps, enabling reasoning beyond the superficial context. Through extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, Micro-Act consistently achieves significant increase in QA accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines across all 5 datasets and 3 conflict types, especially in temporal and semantic types where all baselines fail significantly. More importantly, Micro-Act exhibits robust performance on non-conflict questions simultaneously, highlighting its practical value in real-world RAG applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2025 Main</p></details> |
| **[On the Diminishing Returns of Complex Robust RAG Training in the Era of Powerful LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11400v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems traditionally employ sophisticated training strategies to enhance robustness against retrieval noise. In this work, we investigate a critical question: does the benefit of these complex robust training methods diminish as language models become more powerful? Through systematic evaluation across multiple model scales and question-answering datasets, our analysis reveals a consistent trend: \emph{the marginal robustness benefit of sophisticated training strategies decreases substantially as model capacity increases.} While smaller models show significant performance improvements from complex document selection and adversarial objectives, more capable models achieve comparable or even superior performance with simpler training approaches. Further investigation demonstrates that stronger models naturally exhibit better confidence calibration, cross-dataset generalization capability, and more effective attention patterns, even under simple training regimes. These findings suggest that as foundation models evolve, the engineering effort invested in complex robust training may yield diminishing returns, indicating that simplified RAG pipelines could suffice for powerful models while maintaining competitive performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGIR-AP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Quantum-RAG and PunGPT2: Advancing Low-Resource Language Generation and Retrieval for the Punjabi Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01918v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), low-resource languages remain excluded from NLP, limiting digital access for millions. We present PunGPT2, the first fully open-source Punjabi generative model suite, trained on a 35GB corpus covering literature, religious texts, news, social discourse, etc. PunGPT2 captures Punjabi's syntactic and morphological richness through a tokenizer optimized for Gurmukhi and Shahmukhi scripts. We introduce Pun-RAG, a retrieval-augmented framework integrating PunGPT2 with a FAISS retriever over a curated Punjabi knowledge base, and Pun-Instruct, an instruction-tuned variant using QLoRA for robust zero-shot summarization, translation, and question answering. Our key innovation, Quantum-RAG, fuses sparse, dense, and quantum kernel embeddings for efficient, context-aware retrieval with low memory overhead, marking the first practical quantum-inspired retrieval in a low-resource LLM. Our models outperform multilingual baselines (mBERT, mT5, MuRIL, BLOOM) on FLORES-200, IndicGenBench, and a new PunjabiEval suite. Quantum-RAG yields +7.4 Recall@10 over FAISS and +3.5 BLEU over mT5 on PunjabiEval. We publicly release all training scripts, hyperparameters, evaluation pipelines, the 35GB Punjabi corpus, the PunjabiEval benchmark, and all model weights, establishing new state-of-the-art results for Punjabi language generation and retrieval.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge-Graph Based RAG System Evaluation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02549v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) has become a significant research focus and is utilized in various fields, such as text generation and dialog systems. One of the most essential applications of LLM is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), which greatly enhances generated content's reliability and relevance. However, evaluating RAG systems remains a challenging task. Traditional evaluation metrics struggle to effectively capture the key features of modern LLM-generated content that often exhibits high fluency and naturalness. Inspired by the RAGAS tool, a well-known RAG evaluation framework, we extended this framework into a KG-based evaluation paradigm, enabling multi-hop reasoning and semantic community clustering to derive more comprehensive scoring metrics. By incorporating these comprehensive evaluation criteria, we gain a deeper understanding of RAG systems and a more nuanced perspective on their performance. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we compare its performance with RAGAS scores and construct a human-annotated subset to assess the correlation between human judgments and automated metrics. In addition, we conduct targeted experiments to demonstrate that our KG-based evaluation method is more sensitive to subtle semantic differences in generated outputs. Finally, we discuss the key challenges in evaluating RAG systems and highlight potential directions for future research.</p></details> |  |

The existing methods can be categorized into Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM)-based and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based methods. However, the former were susceptible to hallucinations, while the latter struggled for inter-modal disconnection and cross-page fragmentation. To address these challenges, a novel multi-modal RAG model, named MHier-RAG, was proposed, leveraging both textual and visual information across long-range pages to facilitate accurate question answering for visual-rich documents. A hierarchical indexing method with the integration of flattened in-page chunks and topological cross-page chunks was designed to jointly establish in-page multi-modal associations and long-distance cross-page dependencies. By means of joint similarity evaluation and large language model (LLM)-based re-ranking, a multi-granularity semantic retrieval method, including the page-level parent page retrieval and document-level summary retrieval, was proposed to foster multi-modal evidence connection and long-distance evidence integration and reasoning. Experimental results performed on public datasets, MMLongBench-Doc and LongDocURL, demonstrated the superiority of our MHier-RAG method in understanding and answering modality-rich and multi-page documents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comments: Update Title, Author, Abstract, etc</p></details> |
| **[Stream RAG: Instant and Accurate Spoken Dialogue Systems with Streaming Tool Usage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02044v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end speech-in speech-out dialogue systems are emerging as a powerful alternative to traditional ASR-LLM-TTS pipelines, generating more natural, expressive responses with significantly lower latency. However, these systems remain prone to hallucinations due to limited factual grounding. While text-based dialogue systems address this challenge by integrating tools such as web search and knowledge graph APIs, we introduce the first approach to extend tool use directly into speech-in speech-out systems. A key challenge is that tool integration substantially increases response latency, disrupting conversational flow. To mitigate this, we propose Streaming Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Streaming RAG), a novel framework that reduces user-perceived latency by predicting tool queries in parallel with user speech, even before the user finishes speaking. Specifically, we develop a post-training pipeline that teaches the model when to issue tool calls during ongoing speech and how to generate spoken summaries that fuse audio queries with retrieved text results, thereby improving both accuracy and responsiveness. To evaluate our approach, we construct AudioCRAG, a benchmark created by converting queries from the publicly available CRAG dataset into speech form. Experimental results demonstrate that our streaming RAG approach increases QA accuracy by up to 200% relative (from 11.1% to 34.2% absolute) and further enhances user experience by reducing tool use latency by 20%. Importantly, our streaming RAG approach is modality-agnostic and can be applied equally to typed input, paving the way for more agentic, real-time AI assistants.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAG-BioQA Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Long-Form Biomedical Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01612v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exponential growth of biomedical literature creates significant challenges for accessing precise medical information. Current biomedical question-answering systems primarily focus on short-form answers, failing to provide the comprehensive explanations necessary for clinical decision-making. We present RAG-BioQA, a novel framework combining retrieval-augmented generation with domain-specific fine-tuning to produce evidence-based, long-form biomedical answers. Our approach integrates BioBERT embeddings with FAISS indexing and compares various re-ranking strategies (BM25, ColBERT, MonoT5) to optimize context selection before synthesizing evidence through a fine-tuned T5 model. Experimental results on the PubMedQA dataset show significant improvements over baselines, with our best model achieving substantial gains across BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR metrics, advancing the state of accessible, evidence-based biomedical knowledge retrieval.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-tuning with RAG for Improving LLM Learning of New Skills](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01375v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents deployed for multi-step tasks frequently fail in predictable ways: attempting actions with unmet preconditions, issuing redundant commands, or mishandling environment constraints. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can improve performance by providing runtime guidance, it requires maintaining external knowledge databases and adds computational overhead at every deployment. We propose a simple pipeline that converts inference-time retrieval into learned competence through distillation. Our approach: (1) extracts compact, reusable hints from agent failures, (2) uses these hints to generate improved teacher trajectories via one-shot retrieval at episode start, and (3) trains student models on these trajectories with hint strings removed, forcing internalization rather than memorization. Across two interactive benchmarks, ALFWorld (household tasks) and WebShop (online shopping), distilled students consistently outperform baseline agents, achieving up to 91% success on ALFWorld (vs. 79% for baselines) and improving WebShop scores to 72 (vs. 61 for baselines), while using 10-60% fewer tokens than retrieval-augmented teachers depending on the environment. The approach generalizes across model scales (7B/14B parameters) and agent architectures (ReAct/StateAct), demonstrating that retrieval benefits can be effectively internalized through targeted fine-tuning without permanent runtime dependencies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[Metaphor identification using large language models: A comparison of RAG, prompt engineering, and fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24866v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metaphor is a pervasive feature of discourse and a powerful lens for examining cognition, emotion, and ideology. Large-scale analysis, however, has been constrained by the need for manual annotation due to the context-sensitive nature of metaphor. This study investigates the potential of large language models (LLMs) to automate metaphor identification in full texts. We compare three methods: (i) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where the model is provided with a codebook and instructed to annotate texts based on its rules and examples; (ii) prompt engineering, where we design task-specific verbal instructions; and (iii) fine-tuning, where the model is trained on hand-coded texts to optimize performance. Within prompt engineering, we test zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought strategies. Our results show that state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs can achieve high accuracy, with fine-tuning yielding a median F1 score of 0.79. A comparison of human and LLM outputs reveals that most discrepancies are systematic, reflecting well-known grey areas and conceptual challenges in metaphor theory. We propose that LLMs can be used to at least partly automate metaphor identification and can serve as a testbed for developing and refining metaphor identification protocols and the theory that underpins them.</p></details> |  |
| **[Eyes-on-Me: Scalable RAG Poisoning through Transferable Attention-Steering Attractors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00586v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing data poisoning attacks on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems scale poorly because they require costly optimization of poisoned documents for each target phrase. We introduce Eyes-on-Me, a modular attack that decomposes an adversarial document into reusable Attention Attractors and Focus Regions. Attractors are optimized to direct attention to the Focus Region. Attackers can then insert semantic baits for the retriever or malicious instructions for the generator, adapting to new targets at near zero cost. This is achieved by steering a small subset of attention heads that we empirically identify as strongly correlated with attack success. Across 18 end-to-end RAG settings (3 datasets $\times$ 2 retrievers $\times$ 3 generators), Eyes-on-Me raises average attack success rates from 21.9 to 57.8 (+35.9 points, 2.6$\times$ over prior work). A single optimized attractor transfers to unseen black box retrievers and generators without retraining. Our findings establish a scalable paradigm for RAG data poisoning and show that modular, reusable components pose a practical threat to modern AI systems. They also reveal a strong link between attention concentration and model outputs, informing interpretability research.</p></details> |  |
