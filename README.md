| **[VLN-R1: Vision-Language Navigation via Reinforcement Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17221v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) is a core challenge in embodied AI, requiring agents to navigate real-world environments using natural language instructions. Current language model-based navigation systems operate on discrete topological graphs, limiting path planning to predefined node connections. We propose VLN-R1, an end-to-end framework that leverages Large Vision-Language Models (LVLM) to directly translate egocentric video streams into continuous navigation actions, adopting GRPO-based training inspired by DeepSeek-R1. To enable effective training, we first construct the VLN-Ego dataset using a 3D simulator, Habitat, and propose Long-Short Memory Sampling to balance historical and current observations. While large language models can supervise complete textual instructions, they lack fine-grained action-level control. Our framework employs a two-stage training approach: a) Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to align the model's action sequence text predictions with expert demonstrations, followed by b) Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) enhanced with a Time-Decayed Reward (TDR) mechanism that strategically weights multi-step future actions. Experimental results show VLN-R1 achieves strong performance on VLN-CE benchmark. VLN-R1 proves LVLMs can drive embodied navigation and enhance task-specific reasoning through data-efficient, reward-driven post-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: www.vlnr1.github.io</p></details> |
| **[No Free Lunch: Rethinking Internal Feedback for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17219v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs) to improve reasoning. Approaches like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have shown strong results, but they require extensive external supervision. We investigate an alternative class of methods, Reinforcement Learning from Internal Feedback (RLIF), which relies solely on intrinsic model-derived signals instead of external rewards. In particular, we leverage unsupervised reward proxies such as token-level entropy, trajectory-level entropy, and self-certainty. Our theoretical analysis shows these internal objectives are partially equivalent, and we empirically evaluate various RLIF strategies on challenging math reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that RLIF can boost the reasoning performance of base LLMs at the beginning phase of the training, matching or surpassing RLVR techniques on these tasks. However, when training progresses, performance degrades even below the model before training. Moreover, we find that RLIF yields little improvement for instruction-tuned models, indicating diminishing returns of intrinsic feedback once an LLM is already instruction-tuned. We further analyze this limitation by mixing model weights and explain the reason of RLIF's training behaviors, providing practical guidelines for integrating internal feedback signals into LLM training. We hope our analysis of internal feedback will inform more principled and effective strategies for LLM post-training.</p></details> |  |
| **[AQA-Bench: An Interactive Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs' Sequential Reasoning Ability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09404v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces AQA-Bench, a novel benchmark to assess the sequential reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in algorithmic contexts, such as depth-first search (DFS). The key feature of our evaluation benchmark lies in its interactive evaluation protocol - for example, in DFS, the availability of each node's connected edge is contingent upon the model's traversal to that node, thereby necessitating the LLM's ability to effectively remember visited nodes and strategize subsequent moves considering the possible environmental feedback in the future steps. We comprehensively build AQA-Bench with three different algorithms, namely binary search, depth-first search, and breadth-first search, and to evaluate the sequential reasoning ability of 14 different LLMs. Our investigations reveal several interesting findings: (1) Closed-source models like GPT-4 and Gemini generally show much stronger sequential reasoning ability, significantly outperforming open-source LLMs. (2) Naively providing in-context examples may inadvertently hurt few-shot performance in an interactive environment due to over-fitting to examples. (3) Instead of using optimal steps from another test case as the in-context example, a very limited number of predecessor steps in the current test case following the optimal policy can substantially boost small models' performance. (4) The performance gap between weak models and strong models is greatly due to the incapability of weak models to start well. (5) The scaling correlation between performance and model size is not always significant, sometimes even showcasing an inverse trend. We hope our study can catalyze future work on advancing the understanding and enhancement of LLMs' capabilities in sequential reasoning.

| **[Fine-Tuning Lowers Safety and Disrupts Evaluation Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17209v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning a general-purpose large language model (LLM) for a specific domain or task has become a routine procedure for ordinary users. However, fine-tuning is known to remove the safety alignment features of the model, even when the fine-tuning data does not contain any harmful content. We consider this to be a critical failure mode of LLMs due to the widespread uptake of fine-tuning, combined with the benign nature of the "attack". Most well-intentioned developers are likely unaware that they are deploying an LLM with reduced safety. On the other hand, this known vulnerability can be easily exploited by malicious actors intending to bypass safety guardrails. To make any meaningful progress in mitigating this issue, we first need reliable and reproducible safety evaluations. In this work, we investigate how robust a safety benchmark is to trivial variations in the experimental procedure, and the stochastic nature of LLMs. Our initial experiments expose surprising variance in the results of the safety evaluation, even when seemingly inconsequential changes are made to the fine-tuning setup. Our observations have serious implications for how researchers in this field should report results to enable meaningful comparisons in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear at LLMSEC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Dissecting the SWE-Bench Leaderboards: Profiling Submitters and Architectures of LLM- and Agent-Based Repair Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17208v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress in Automated Program Repair (APR) has been driven by advances in AI, particularly large language models (LLMs) and agent-based systems. SWE-Bench is a recent benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based repair systems using real issues and pull requests mined from 12 popular open-source Python repositories. Its public leaderboards, SWE-Bench Lite and SWE-Bench Verified, have become central platforms for tracking progress and comparing solutions. However, because the submission process does not require detailed documentation, the architectural design and origin of many solutions remain unclear. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of all submissions to the SWE-Bench Lite (68 entries) and Verified (79 entries) leaderboards, analyzing 67 unique approaches across dimensions such as submitter type, product availability, LLM usage, and system architecture. Our findings reveal the dominance of proprietary LLMs (especially Claude 3.5/3.7), the presence of both agentic and non-agentic designs, and a contributor base spanning from individual developers to large tech companies.</p></details> |  |
| **[High-Dimensional Interlingual Representations of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11280v4)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) trained on massive multilingual datasets hint at the formation of interlingual constructs--a shared subspace in the representation space. However, evidence regarding this phenomenon is mixed, leaving it unclear whether these models truly develop unified interlingual representations, or present a partially aligned constructs. We explore 31 diverse languages varying on their resource-levels, typologies, and geographical regions; and find that multilingual LLMs exhibit inconsistent cross-lingual alignments. To address this, we propose an interlingual representation framework identifying both the shared interlingual semantic subspace and fragmented components, existed due to representational limitations. We introduce Interlingual Local Overlap (ILO) score to quantify interlingual alignment by comparing the local neighborhood structures of high-dimensional representations. We utilize ILO to investigate the impact of single-language fine-tuning on the interlingual representations in multilingual LLMs. Our results indicate that training exclusively on a single language disrupts the alignment in early layers, while freezing these layers preserves the alignment of interlingual representations, leading to improved cross-lingual generalization. These results validate our framework and metric for evaluating interlingual representation, and further underscore that interlingual alignment is crucial for scalable multilingual learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Confidence Scoring for LLM-Generated SQL in Supply Chain Data Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17203v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently enabled natural language interfaces that translate user queries into executable SQL, offering a powerful solution for non-technical stakeholders to access structured data. However, one of the limitation that LLMs do not natively express uncertainty makes it difficult to assess the reliability of their generated queries. This paper presents a case study that evaluates multiple approaches to estimate confidence scores for LLM-generated SQL in supply chain data retrieval. We investigated three strategies: (1) translation-based consistency checks; (2) embedding-based semantic similarity between user questions and generated SQL; and (3) self-reported confidence scores directly produced by the LLM. Our findings reveal that LLMs are often overconfident in their own outputs, which limits the effectiveness of self-reported confidence. In contrast, embedding-based similarity methods demonstrate strong discriminative power in identifying inaccurate SQL.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by KDD workshop AI for Supply Chain 2025</p></details> |
| **[Detecting LLM-Generated Short Answers and Effects on Learner Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17196v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing availability of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns about their potential misuse in online learning. While tools for detecting LLM-generated text exist and are widely used by researchers and educators, their reliability varies. Few studies have compared the accuracy of detection methods, defined criteria to identify content generated by LLM, or evaluated the effect on learner performance from LLM misuse within learning. In this study, we define LLM-generated text within open responses as those produced by any LLM without paraphrasing or refinement, as evaluated by human coders. We then fine-tune GPT-4o to detect LLM-generated responses and assess the impact on learning from LLM misuse. We find that our fine-tuned LLM outperforms the existing AI detection tool GPTZero, achieving an accuracy of 80% and an F1 score of 0.78, compared to GPTZero's accuracy of 70% and macro F1 score of 0.50, demonstrating superior performance in detecting LLM-generated responses. We also find that learners suspected of LLM misuse in the open response question were more than twice as likely to correctly answer the corresponding posttest MCQ, suggesting potential misuse across both question types and indicating a bypass of the learning process. We pave the way for future work by demonstrating a structured, code-based approach to improve LLM-generated response detection and propose using auxiliary statistical indicators such as unusually high assessment scores on related tasks, readability scores, and response duration. In support of open science, we contribute data and code to support the fine-tuning of similar models for similar use cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 19th European Conference on Technology Enhanced Learning (ECTEL 2025).

| **[TALE: A Tool-Augmented Framework for Reference-Free Evaluation of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07385v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into real-world, autonomous applications, relying on static, pre-annotated references for evaluation poses significant challenges in cost, scalability, and completeness. We propose Tool-Augmented LLM Evaluation (TALE), a framework to assess LLM outputs without predetermined ground-truth answers. Unlike conventional metrics that compare to fixed references or depend solely on LLM-as-a-judge knowledge, TALE employs an agent with tool-access capabilities that actively retrieves and synthesizes external evidence. It iteratively generates web queries, collects information, summarizes findings, and refines subsequent searches through reflection. By shifting away from static references, TALE aligns with free-form question-answering tasks common in real-world scenarios. Experimental results on multiple free-form QA benchmarks show that TALE not only outperforms standard reference-based metrics for measuring response accuracy but also achieves substantial to near-perfect agreement with human evaluations. TALE enhances the reliability of LLM evaluations in real-world, dynamic scenarios without relying on static references.</p></details> |  |
| **[Convergent Linear Representations of Emergent Misalignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11618v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning large language models on narrow datasets can cause them to develop broadly misaligned behaviours: a phenomena known as emergent misalignment. However, the mechanisms underlying this misalignment, and why it generalizes beyond the training domain, are poorly understood, demonstrating critical gaps in our knowledge of model alignment. In this work, we train and study a minimal model organism which uses just 9 rank-1 adapters to emergently misalign Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct. Studying this, we find that different emergently misaligned models converge to similar representations of misalignment. We demonstrate this convergence by extracting a 'misalignment direction' from one fine-tuned model's activations, and using it to effectively ablate misaligned behaviour from fine-tunes using higher dimensional LoRAs and different datasets. Leveraging the scalar hidden state of rank-1 LoRAs, we further present a set of experiments for directly interpreting the fine-tuning adapters, showing that six contribute to general misalignment, while two specialise for misalignment in just the fine-tuning domain. Emergent misalignment is a particularly salient example of undesirable and unexpected model behaviour and by advancing our understanding of the mechanisms behind it, we hope to move towards being able to better understand and mitigate misalignment more generally.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs and Stack Overflow Discussions: Reliability, Impact, and Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08801v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since its release in November 2022, ChatGPT has shaken up Stack Overflow, the premier platform for developers queries on programming and software development. Demonstrating an ability to generate instant, human-like responses to technical questions, ChatGPT has ignited debates within the developer community about the evolving role of human-driven platforms in the age of generative AI. Two months after ChatGPT release, Meta released its answer with its own Large Language Model (LLM) called LLaMA: the race was on. We conducted an empirical study analyzing questions from Stack Overflow and using these LLMs to address them. This way, we aim to (i) quantify the reliability of LLMs answers and their potential to replace Stack Overflow in the long term; (ii) identify and understand why LLMs fail; (iii) measure users activity evolution with Stack Overflow over time; and (iv) compare LLMs together. Our empirical results are unequivocal: ChatGPT and LLaMA challenge human expertise, yet do not outperform it for some domains, while a significant decline in user posting activity has been observed. Furthermore, we also discuss the impact of our findings regarding the usage and development of new LLMs and provide guidelines for future challenges faced by users and researchers.</p></details> | 63 pages, 11 figures |
| **[The MedPerturb Dataset: What Non-Content Perturbations Reveal About Human and Clinical LLM Decision Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17163v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical robustness is critical to the safe deployment of medical Large Language Models (LLMs), but key questions remain about how LLMs and humans may differ in response to the real-world variability typified by clinical settings. To address this, we introduce MedPerturb, a dataset designed to systematically evaluate medical LLMs under controlled perturbations of clinical input. MedPerturb consists of clinical vignettes spanning a range of pathologies, each transformed along three axes: (1) gender modifications (e.g., gender-swapping or gender-removal); (2) style variation (e.g., uncertain phrasing or colloquial tone); and (3) format changes (e.g., LLM-generated multi-turn conversations or summaries). With MedPerturb, we release a dataset of 800 clinical contexts grounded in realistic input variability, outputs from four LLMs, and three human expert reads per clinical context. We use MedPerturb in two case studies to reveal how shifts in gender identity cues, language style, or format reflect diverging treatment selections between humans and LLMs. We find that LLMs are more sensitive to gender and style perturbations while human annotators are more sensitive to LLM-generated format perturbations such as clinical summaries. Our results highlight the need for evaluation frameworks that go beyond static benchmarks to assess the similarity between human clinician and LLM decisions under the variability characteristic of clinical settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[LaRS: Latent Reasoning Skills for Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04684v4)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting is a popular in-context learning (ICL) approach for large language models (LLMs), especially when tackling complex reasoning tasks. Traditional ICL approaches construct prompts using examples that contain questions similar to the input question. However, CoT prompting, which includes crucial intermediate reasoning steps (rationales) within its examples, necessitates selecting examples based on these rationales rather than the questions themselves. Existing methods require human experts or pre-trained LLMs to describe the skill, a high-level abstraction of rationales, to guide the selection. These methods, however, are often costly and difficult to scale. Instead, this paper introduces a new approach named Latent Reasoning Skills (LaRS) that employs unsupervised learning to create a latent space representation of rationales, with a latent variable called a reasoning skill. Concurrently, LaRS learns a reasoning policy to determine the required reasoning skill for a given question. Then the ICL examples are selected by aligning the reasoning skills between past examples and the question. This approach is theoretically grounded and compute-efficient, eliminating the need for auxiliary LLM inference or manual prompt design. Empirical results demonstrate that LaRS consistently outperforms SOTA skill-based selection methods, processing example banks four times faster, reducing LLM inferences during the selection stage by half, and showing greater robustness to sub-optimal example banks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do We Need Large VLMs for Spotting Soccer Actions?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17144v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional video-based tasks like soccer action spotting rely heavily on visual inputs, often requiring complex and computationally expensive models to process dense video data. In this work, we propose a shift from this video-centric approach to a text-based task, making it lightweight and scalable by utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) instead of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We posit that expert commentary, which provides rich, fine-grained descriptions and contextual cues such as excitement and tactical insights, contains enough information to reliably spot key actions in a match. To demonstrate this, we use the SoccerNet Echoes dataset, which provides timestamped commentary, and employ a system of three LLMs acting as judges specializing in outcome, excitement, and tactics. Each LLM evaluates sliding windows of commentary to identify actions like goals, cards, and substitutions, generating accurate timestamps for these events. Our experiments show that this language-centric approach performs effectively in detecting critical match events, providing a lightweight and training-free alternative to traditional video-based methods for action spotting.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Watch and Listen: Understanding Audio-Visual-Speech Moments with Multimodal LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18110v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans naturally understand moments in a video by integrating visual and auditory cues. For example, localizing a scene in the video like "A scientist passionately speaks on wildlife conservation as dramatic orchestral music plays, with the audience nodding and applauding" requires simultaneous processing of visual, audio, and speech signals. However, existing models often struggle to effectively fuse and interpret audio information, limiting their capacity for comprehensive video temporal understanding. To address this, we present TriSense, a triple-modality large language model designed for holistic video temporal understanding through the integration of visual, audio, and speech modalities. Central to TriSense is a Query-Based Connector that adaptively reweights modality contributions based on the input query, enabling robust performance under modality dropout and allowing flexible combinations of available inputs. To support TriSense's multimodal capabilities, we introduce TriSense-2M, a high-quality dataset of over 2 million curated samples generated via an automated pipeline powered by fine-tuned LLMs. TriSense-2M includes long-form videos and diverse modality combinations, facilitating broad generalization. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of TriSense and its potential to advance multimodal video analysis. Code and dataset will be publicly released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Model Unlearning for Source Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17125v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM4SE has demonstrated significant success, but LLMs' potential memorization of sensitive or outdated training data introduces critical risks to legal compliance, software security, and code quality. LLM unlearning techniques, which can eliminate the influence of undesired data from LLMs in a post-training way, present a promising solution to address these concerns. While recent efforts in LLM unlearning show effectiveness in natural language, their applicability to source code remains underexplored. Our empirical study reveals that existing LLM unlearning approaches, when applied to source code, cause severe model utility degradation, rendering models practically unusable for code generation. In this paper, we propose PROD, a novel unlearning approach that enables LLMs to forget undesired code content while effectively preserving their code generation capabilities. PROD suppresses the probability of forget data in LLMs' output distribution while promoting candidate distributional components, enabling the model to jointly learn to forget specific content and retain its general capabilities. To facilitate this study, we establish a benchmark for code unlearning evaluation, which includes three critical downstream tasks: copyrighted code unlearning, insecure code unlearning, and deprecated API unlearning. Our evaluation demonstrates that PROD achieves superior balance between forget quality and model utility compared to existing unlearning approaches across three downstream tasks, while consistently exhibiting improvements when applied to LLMs of varying series. PROD also exhibits superior robustness against adversarial attacks without generating or exposing the data to be forgotten. The results underscore that our approach not only extends the application boundary of unlearning techniques to source code, but also holds significant implications for advancing reliable code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Watermarking Language Models through Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05091v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Watermarking the outputs of large language models (LLMs) is critical for provenance tracing, content regulation, and model accountability. Existing approaches often rely on access to model internals or are constrained by static rules and token-level perturbations. Moreover, the idea of steering generative behavior via prompt-based instruction control remains largely underexplored. We introduce a prompt-guided watermarking framework that operates entirely at the input level and requires no access to model parameters or decoding logits. The framework comprises three cooperating components: a Prompting LM that synthesizes watermarking instructions from user prompts, a Marking LM that generates watermarked outputs conditioned on these instructions, and a Detecting LM trained to classify whether a response carries an embedded watermark. This modular design enables dynamic watermarking that adapts to individual prompts while remaining compatible with diverse LLM architectures, including both proprietary and open-weight models. We evaluate the framework over 25 combinations of Prompting and Marking LMs, such as GPT-4o, Mistral, LLaMA3, and DeepSeek. Experimental results show that watermark signals generalize across architectures and remain robust under fine-tuning, model distillation, and prompt-based adversarial attacks, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Calibrating Pre-trained Language Classifiers on LLM-generated Noisy Labels via Iterative Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19675v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The traditional process of creating labeled datasets is labor-intensive and expensive. Recent breakthroughs in open-source large language models (LLMs) have opened up a new avenue in generating labeled datasets automatically for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, providing an alternative to such an expensive annotation process. However, the reliability of such auto-generated labels remains a significant concern due to inherent inaccuracies. When learning from noisy labels, the model's generalization is likely to be harmed as it is prone to overfit to those label noises. While previous studies in learning from noisy labels mainly focus on synthetic noise and real-world noise, LLM-generated label noise receives less attention. In this paper, we propose SiDyP: Simplex Label Diffusion with Dynamic Prior to calibrate the classifier's prediction, thus enhancing its robustness towards LLM-generated noisy labels. SiDyP retrieves potential true label candidates by neighborhood label distribution in text embedding space and iteratively refines noisy candidates using a simplex diffusion model. Our framework can increase the performance of the BERT classifier fine-tuned on both zero-shot and few-shot LLM-generated noisy label datasets by an average of 7.21% and 7.30% respectively. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SiDyP by conducting extensive benchmarking for different LLMs over a variety of NLP tasks. Our code is available on Github.</p></details> | Accepted at KDD'25 |
| **[When Can Model-Free Reinforcement Learning be Enough for Thinking?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17124v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work on large language models has demonstrated the use of model-free reinforcement learning (RL) to train reasoning-like capabilities. The emergence of "thinking" through model-free RL is interesting as thinking actions neither produce reward nor change the external world state to one where the agent is more likely to get reward. This paper seeks to build a domain-independent understanding of when model-free RL will lead to "thinking" as a strategy for reward maximization. To build this understanding, we first introduce a theoretical model which we call a \textit{thought Markov decision process} (MDP). Thought MDPs minimally extend the classical MDP model to include an abstract notion of thought state and thought action. Using the thought MDP model, we prove the importance of policy initialization in determining whether or not thinking emerges and show formally that thought actions are equivalent to the agent choosing to perform a step of policy improvement before continuing to act. We then show that open-source LLMs satisfy the conditions that our theory predicts are necessary for model-free RL to produce thinking-like behavior. Finally, we hypothesize sufficient conditions that would enable thinking to be learned outside of language generation and introduce a toy domain where a combination of multi-task pre-training and designated thought actions enable more data-efficient RL compared to non-thinking agents.</p></details> | 15 pages, 3 figures |

These benchmarks allow models to be compared for different aspects of safety such as toxicity, bias, harmful behavior etc. Independent benchmarks adopt different approaches with distinct data sets and evaluation methods. We investigate how robust such benchmarks are by using different approaches to rank a set of representative models for bias and compare how similar are the overall rankings. We show that different but widely used bias evaluations methods result in disparate model rankings. We conclude with recommendations for the community in the usage of such benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 Workshop GEM</p></details> |
| **[Towards Advanced Mathematical Reasoning for LLMs via First-Order Logic Theorem Proving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17104v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising first-order logic (FOL) reasoning capabilities with applications in various areas. However, their effectiveness in complex mathematical reasoning involving multi-step FOL deductions is still under-researched. While LLMs perform competitively on established mathematical reasoning benchmarks, they struggle with multi-step FOL tasks, as demonstrated by Deepseek-Prover-V2-7B's low accuracy (4.2%) on our proposed theorem proving dataset. This issue arises from the limited exploration of diverse proof strategies and the potential for early reasoning mistakes to undermine entire proofs. To address these issues, we propose DREAM, a self-adaptive solution that enhances the Diversity and REAsonability of LLMs' generation strategies. DREAM incorporates an Axiom-Driven Strategy Diversification mechanism to promote varied strategic outcomes and a Sub-Proposition Error Feedback to help LLMs reflect on and correct their proofs. Our contributions include pioneering advancements in LLMs' mathematical reasoning through FOL theorem proving, introducing a novel inference stage solution that improves performance by 0.6% to 6.4%, and providing a curated dataset of 447 mathematical theorems in Lean 4 format for evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Domain Specific Benchmarks for Evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12958v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed across disciplines due to their advanced reasoning and problem solving capabilities. To measure their effectiveness, various benchmarks have been developed that measure aspects of LLM reasoning, comprehension, and problem-solving. While several surveys address LLM evaluation and benchmarks, a domain-specific analysis remains underexplored in the literature. This paper introduces a taxonomy of seven key disciplines, encompassing various domains and application areas where LLMs are extensively utilized. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive review of LLM benchmarks and survey papers within each domain, highlighting the unique capabilities of LLMs and the challenges faced in their application. Finally, we compile and categorize these benchmarks by domain to create an accessible resource for researchers, aiming to pave the way for advancements toward artificial general intelligence (AGI)</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain-of-Thought Prompting Obscures Hallucination Cues in Large Language Models: An Empirical Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17088v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit \textit{hallucinations}, generating factually incorrect or semantically irrelevant content in response to prompts. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting can mitigate hallucinations by encouraging step-by-step reasoning, but its impact on hallucination detection remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic empirical evaluation. We begin with a pilot experiment, revealing that CoT reasoning significantly affects the LLM's internal states and token probability distributions. Building on this, we evaluate the impact of various CoT prompting methods on mainstream hallucination detection methods across both instruction-tuned and reasoning-oriented LLMs. Specifically, we examine three key dimensions: changes in hallucination score distributions, variations in detection accuracy, and shifts in detection confidence. Our findings show that while CoT prompting helps reduce hallucination frequency, it also tends to obscure critical signals used for detection, impairing the effectiveness of various detection methods. Our study highlights an overlooked trade-off in the use of reasoning. Code is publicly available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/cot-hallu-detect.</p></details> |  |
| **[ScholarSearch: Benchmarking Scholar Searching Ability of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13784v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs)' search capabilities have garnered significant attention. Existing benchmarks, such as OpenAI's BrowseComp, primarily focus on general search scenarios and fail to adequately address the specific demands of academic search. These demands include deeper literature tracing and organization, professional support for academic databases, the ability to navigate long-tail academic knowledge, and ensuring academic rigor. Here, we proposed ScholarSearch, the first dataset specifically designed to evaluate the complex information retrieval capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in academic research. ScholarSearch possesses the following key characteristics: Academic Practicality, where question content closely mirrors real academic learning and research environments, avoiding deliberately misleading models; High Difficulty, with answers that are challenging for single models (e.g., Grok DeepSearch or Gemini Deep Research) to provide directly, often requiring at least three deep searches to derive; Concise Evaluation, where limiting conditions ensure answers are as unique as possible, accompanied by clear sources and brief solution explanations, greatly facilitating subsequent audit and verification, surpassing the current lack of analyzed search datasets both domestically and internationally; and Broad Coverage, as the dataset spans at least 15 different academic disciplines. Through ScholarSearch, we expect to more precisely measure and promote the performance improvement of LLMs in complex academic information retrieval tasks.

Fortunately, LAE naturally aligns with near-field communications in extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) systems. By leveraging near-field beamfocusing, LAE can precisely direct beam energy to unmanned aerial vehicles, while the additional distance dimension boosts overall spectrum efficiency. However, near-field communications in LAE still face several challenges, such as the increase in signal processing complexity and the necessity of distinguishing between far and near-field users. Inspired by the large language models (LLM) with powerful ability to handle complex problems, we apply LLM to solve challenges of near-field communications in LAE. The objective of this article is to provide a comprehensive analysis and discussion on LLM-empowered near-field communications in LAE. Specifically, we first introduce fundamentals of LLM and near-field communications, including the key advantages of LLM and key characteristics of near-field communications. Then, we reveal the opportunities and challenges of near-field communications in LAE. To address these challenges, we present a LLM-based scheme for near-field communications in LAE, and provide a case study which jointly distinguishes far and near-field users and designs multi-user precoding matrix. Finally, we outline and highlight several future research directions and open issues.</p></details> |  |

Due to their strong image-text alignment capability, MLLMs can effectively understand image-text pairs with clear meanings. However, effectively resolving the inherent ambiguities in natural language and visual contexts remains challenging. Existing multimodal benchmarks typically overlook linguistic and visual ambiguities, relying mainly on unimodal context for disambiguation and thus failing to exploit the mutual clarification potential between modalities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MUCAR, a novel and challenging benchmark designed explicitly for evaluating multimodal ambiguity resolution across multilingual and cross-modal scenarios. MUCAR includes: (1) a multilingual dataset where ambiguous textual expressions are uniquely resolved by corresponding visual contexts, and (2) a dual-ambiguity dataset that systematically pairs ambiguous images with ambiguous textual contexts, with each combination carefully constructed to yield a single, clear interpretation through mutual disambiguation. Extensive evaluations involving 19 state-of-the-art multimodal models--encompassing both open-source and proprietary architectures--reveal substantial gaps compared to human-level performance, highlighting the need for future research into more sophisticated cross-modal ambiguity comprehension methods, further pushing the boundaries of multimodal reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReplaceMe: Network Simplification via Depth Pruning and Transformer Block Linearization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02819v3)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce ReplaceMe, a generalized training-free depth pruning method that effectively replaces transformer blocks with a linear operation, while maintaining high performance for low compression ratios. In contrast to conventional pruning approaches that require additional training or fine-tuning, our approach requires only a small calibration dataset that is used to estimate a linear transformation, which approximates the pruned blocks. The estimated linear mapping can be seamlessly merged with the remaining transformer blocks, eliminating the need for any additional network parameters. Our experiments show that ReplaceMe consistently outperforms other training-free approaches and remains highly competitive with state-of-the-art pruning methods that involve extensive retraining/fine-tuning and architectural modifications. Applied to several large language models (LLMs), ReplaceMe achieves up to 25% pruning while retaining approximately 90% of the original model's performance on open benchmarks - without any training or healing steps, resulting in minimal computational overhead (see Fig.1). We provide an open-source library implementing ReplaceMe alongside several state-of-the-art depth pruning techniques, available at https://github.com/mts-ai/ReplaceMe.</p></details> |  |

A Large-Scale Replication of Scenario-Based Experiments in Psychology and Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00128v3)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly being integrated into scientific research, particularly in the social sciences, where understanding human behavior is critical. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in replicating human-like responses in various psychological experiments. We conducted a large-scale study replicating 156 psychological experiments from top social science journals using three state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and DeepSeek v3). Our results reveal that while LLMs demonstrate high replication rates for main effects (73-81%) and moderate to strong success with interaction effects (46-63%), They consistently produce larger effect sizes than human studies, with Fisher Z values approximately 2-3 times higher than human studies. Notably, LLMs show significantly lower replication rates for studies involving socially sensitive topics such as race, gender and ethics. When original studies reported null findings, LLMs produced significant results at remarkably high rates (68-83%) - while this could reflect cleaner data with less noise, as evidenced by narrower confidence intervals, it also suggests potential risks of effect size overestimation. Our results demonstrate both the promise and challenges of LLMs in psychological research, offering efficient tools for pilot testing and rapid hypothesis validation while enriching rather than replacing traditional human subject studies, yet requiring more nuanced interpretation and human validation for complex social phenomena and culturally sensitive research questions.</p></details> | 5 figures, 2 tables |
| **[LLM-Generated Feedback Supports Learning If Learners Choose to Use It](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17006v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate feedback, yet their impact on learning remains underexplored, especially compared to existing feedback methods. This study investigates how on-demand LLM-generated explanatory feedback influences learning in seven scenario-based tutor training lessons. Analyzing over 2,600 lesson completions from 885 tutor learners, we compare posttest performance among learners across three groups: learners who received feedback generated by gpt-3.5-turbo, those who declined it, and those without access. All groups received non-LLM corrective feedback. To address potential selection bias-where higher-performing learners may be more inclined to use LLM feedback-we applied propensity scoring. Learners with a higher predicted likelihood of engaging with LLM feedback scored significantly higher at posttest than those with lower propensity. After adjusting for this effect, two out of seven lessons showed statistically significant learning benefits from LLM feedback with standardized effect sizes of 0.28 and 0.33. These moderate effects suggest that the effectiveness of LLM feedback depends on the learners' tendency to seek support. Importantly, LLM feedback did not significantly increase completion time, and learners overwhelmingly rated it as helpful. These findings highlight LLM feedback's potential as a low-cost and scalable way to improve learning on open-ended tasks, particularly in existing systems already providing feedback without LLMs. This work contributes open datasets, LLM prompts, and rubrics to support reproducibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full research paper accepted at EC-TEL '25</p></details> |

Despite recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and Retrieval Augmented Generation that have enhanced the factual base of LLMs, the task of retaining extensive personal information and using it to generate personalized responses remains pertinent. To address this, we propose utilizing external memory in the form of knowledge graphs, which are constructed and updated by the LLM itself. We have expanded upon ideas of AriGraph architecture and for the first time introduced a combined graph featuring both standard edges and two types of hyperedges. Experiments conducted on the TriviaQA, HotpotQA and DiaASQ benchmarks indicates that this approach aids in making the process of graph construction and knowledge extraction unified and robust. Furthermore, we augmented the DiaASQ benchmark by incorporating parameters such as time into dialogues and introducing contradictory statements made by the same speaker at different times. Despite these modifications, the performance of the question-answering system remained robust, demonstrating the proposed architecture's ability to maintain and utilize temporal dependencies.</p></details> |  |

This challenge has spurred efforts in attributed text generation, which prompts LLMs to generate content with supporting evidence. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, called Think&Cite, and formulate attributed text generation as a multi-step reasoning problem integrated with search. Specifically, we propose Self-Guided Monte Carlo Tree Search (SG-MCTS), which capitalizes on the self-reflection capability of LLMs to reason about the intermediate states of MCTS for guiding the tree expansion process. To provide reliable and comprehensive feedback, we introduce Progress Reward Modeling to measure the progress of tree search from the root to the current state from two aspects, i.e., generation and attribution progress. We conduct extensive experiments on three datasets and the results show that our approach significantly outperforms baseline approaches.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |

Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising opportunity for researchers to produce publication-ready material using LaTeX with natural language instructions, yet current benchmarks completely lack evaluation of this ability. By introducing TeXpert, our benchmark dataset with natural language prompts for generating LaTeX code focused on components of scientific documents across multiple difficulty levels, we conduct an in-depth analysis of LLM performance in this regard and identify frequent error types. Our evaluation across open and closed-source LLMs highlights multiple key findings: LLMs excelling on standard benchmarks perform poorly in LaTeX generation with a significant accuracy drop-off as the complexity of tasks increases; open-source models like DeepSeek v3 and DeepSeek Coder strongly rival closed-source counterparts in LaTeX tasks; and formatting and package errors are unexpectedly prevalent, suggesting a lack of diverse LaTeX examples in the training datasets of most LLMs. Our dataset, code, and model evaluations are available at https://github.com/knowledge-verse-ai/TeXpert.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the SDProc Workshop @ ACL 2025</p></details> |

This paper evaluates the performance of the Tenstorrent Grayskull e75 RISC-V accelerator for basic linear algebra kernels at reduced numerical precision, a fundamental operation in LLM computations. We present a detailed characterization of Grayskull's execution model, gridsize, matrix dimensions, data formats, and numerical precision impact computational efficiency. Furthermore, we compare Grayskull's performance against state-of-the-art architectures with tensor acceleration, including Intel Sapphire Rapids processors and two NVIDIA GPUs (V100 and A100). Whilst NVIDIA GPUs dominate raw performance, Grayskull demonstrates a competitive trade-off between power consumption and computational throughput, reaching a peak of 1.55 TFLOPs/Watt with BF16.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the Computational Aspects of Deep Learning Workshop at ISC High Performance 2025.

These monitors continuously record system-level activities as audit logs and provide deep visibility into security events. Unfortunately, existing methods of semantic analysis based on audit logs have low granularity, only reaching the system call level, making it difficult to effectively classify highly covert behaviors. Additionally, existing works mainly match audit log streams with rule knowledge bases describing behaviors, which heavily rely on expertise and lack the ability to detect unknown attacks and provide interpretive descriptions. In this paper, we propose SmartGuard, an automated method that combines abstracted behaviors from audit event semantics with large language models. SmartGuard extracts specific behaviors (function level) from incoming system logs and constructs a knowledge graph, divides events by threads, and combines event summaries with graph embeddings to achieve information diagnosis and provide explanatory narratives through large language models. Our evaluation shows that SmartGuard achieves an average F1 score of 96\% in assessing malicious behaviors and demonstrates good scalability across multiple models and unknown attacks. It also possesses excellent fine-tuning capabilities, allowing experts to assist in timely system updates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Concept Disentanglement in Transformer-based Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16975v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When large language models (LLMs) use in-context learning (ICL) to solve a new task, they seem to grasp not only the goal of the task but also core, latent concepts in the demonstration examples. This begs the question of whether transformers represent latent structures as part of their computation or whether they take shortcuts to solve the problem. Prior mechanistic work on ICL does not address this question because it does not sufficiently examine the relationship between the learned representation and the latent concept, and the considered problem settings often involve only single-step reasoning. In this work, we examine how transformers disentangle and use latent concepts. We show that in 2-hop reasoning tasks with a latent, discrete concept, the model successfully identifies the latent concept and does step-by-step concept composition. In tasks parameterized by a continuous latent concept, we find low-dimensional subspaces in the representation space where the geometry mimics the underlying parameterization. Together, these results refine our understanding of ICL and the representation of transformers, and they provide evidence for highly localized structures in the model that disentangle latent concepts in ICL tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Collaborative Perception Datasets for Autonomous Driving: A Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12696v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative perception has attracted growing interest from academia and industry due to its potential to enhance perception accuracy, safety, and robustness in autonomous driving through multi-agent information fusion. With the advancement of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication, numerous collaborative perception datasets have emerged, varying in cooperation paradigms, sensor configurations, data sources, and application scenarios. However, the absence of systematic summarization and comparative analysis hinders effective resource utilization and standardization of model evaluation. As the first comprehensive review focused on collaborative perception datasets, this work reviews and compares existing resources from a multi-dimensional perspective. We categorize datasets based on cooperation paradigms, examine their data sources and scenarios, and analyze sensor modalities and supported tasks. A detailed comparative analysis is conducted across multiple dimensions. We also outline key challenges and future directions, including dataset scalability, diversity, domain adaptation, standardization, privacy, and the integration of large language models. To support ongoing research, we provide a continuously updated online repository of collaborative perception datasets and related literature: https://github.com/frankwnb/Collaborative-Perception-Datasets-for-Autonomous-Driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>18pag...</summary><p>18pages, 7figures, journal</p></details> |
| **[MM-AttacKG: A Multimodal Approach to Attack Graph Construction with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16968v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) parsing aims to extract key threat information from massive data, transform it into actionable intelligence, enhance threat detection and defense efficiency, including attack graph construction, intelligence fusion and indicator extraction. Among these research topics, Attack Graph Construction (AGC) is essential for visualizing and understanding the potential attack paths of threat events from CTI reports. Existing approaches primarily construct the attack graphs purely from the textual data to reveal the logical threat relationships between entities within the attack behavioral sequence. However, they typically overlook the specific threat information inherent in visual modalities, which preserves the key threat details from inherently-multimodal CTI report. Therefore, we enhance the effectiveness of attack graph construction by analyzing visual information through Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Specifically, we propose a novel framework, MM-AttacKG, which can effectively extract key information from threat images and integrate it into attack graph construction, thereby enhancing the comprehensiveness and accuracy of attack graphs. It first employs a threat image parsing module to extract critical threat information from images and generate descriptions using MLLMs. Subsequently, it builds an iterative question-answering pipeline tailored for image parsing to refine the understanding of threat images. Finally, it achieves content-level integration between attack graphs and image-based answers through MLLMs, completing threat information enhancement. The experimental results demonstrate that MM-AttacKG can accurately identify key information in threat images and significantly improve the quality of multimodal attack graph construction, effectively addressing the shortcomings of existing methods in utilizing image-based threat information.</p></details> |  |

The issue is particularly relevant for the evaluation of the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), which are generally trained on gargantuan, and generally opaque, corpora of text scraped from the world wide web. Developing tools to detect contamination is therefore crucial to be able to fairly and properly track the evolution of the performance of LLMs. To date, only a few recent studies have attempted to address the issue of quantifying and detecting contamination in short text sequences, such as those commonly found in benchmarks. However, these methods have limitations that can sometimes render them impractical. In the present paper, we introduce LogProber, a novel, efficient algorithm that we show to be able to detect contamination in a black box setting that tries to tackle some of these drawbacks by focusing on the familiarity with the question rather than the answer. Here, we explore the properties of the proposed method in comparison with concurrent approaches, identify its advantages and limitations, and illustrate how different forms of contamination can go undetected depending on the design of the detection algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Step-by-Step and Verifiable Medical Reasoning in MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16962v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have begun to demonstrate robust reasoning capabilities on general tasks, yet their application in the medical domain remains in its early stages. Constructing chain-of-thought (CoT) training data is essential for bolstering the reasoning abilities of medical MLLMs. However, existing approaches exhibit a deficiency in offering a comprehensive framework for searching and evaluating effective reasoning paths towards critical diagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose Mentor-Intern Collaborative Search (MICS), a novel reasoning-path searching scheme to generate rigorous and effective medical CoT data. MICS first leverages mentor models to initialize the reasoning, one step at a time, then prompts each intern model to continue the thinking along those initiated paths, and finally selects the optimal reasoning path according to the overall reasoning performance of multiple intern models. The reasoning performance is determined by an MICS-Score, which assesses the quality of generated reasoning paths. Eventually, we construct MMRP, a multi-task medical reasoning dataset with ranked difficulty, and Chiron-o1, a new medical MLLM devised via a curriculum learning strategy, with robust visual question-answering and generalizable reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Chiron-o1, trained on our CoT dataset constructed using MICS, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a list of medical visual question answering and reasoning benchmarks.

However, prior research has largely overlooked the security risks inherent in the generated code. In this work, we introduce SafeGenBench, a benchmark specifically designed to assess the security of LLM-generated code. The dataset encompasses a wide range of common software development scenarios and vulnerability types. Building upon this benchmark, we develop an automatic evaluation framework that leverages both static application security testing(SAST) and LLM-based judging to assess the presence of security vulnerabilities in model-generated code. Through the empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs on SafeGenBench, we reveal notable deficiencies in their ability to produce vulnerability-free code. Our findings highlight pressing challenges and offer actionable insights for future advancements in the secure code generation performance of LLMs. The data and code will be released soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Calibrated Predictive Lower Bounds on Time-to-Unsafe-Sampling in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13593v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a framework to quantify the time-to-unsafe-sampling - the number of large language model (LLM) generations required to trigger an unsafe (e.g., toxic) response. Estimating this quantity is challenging, since unsafe responses are exceedingly rare in well-aligned LLMs, potentially occurring only once in thousands of generations. As a result, directly estimating time-to-unsafe-sampling would require collecting training data with a prohibitively large number of generations per prompt. However, with realistic sampling budgets, we often cannot generate enough responses to observe an unsafe outcome for every prompt, leaving the time-to-unsafe-sampling unobserved in many cases, making the estimation and evaluation tasks particularly challenging. To address this, we frame this estimation problem as one of survival analysis and develop a provably calibrated lower predictive bound (LPB) on the time-to-unsafe-sampling of a given prompt, leveraging recent advances in conformal prediction. Our key innovation is designing an adaptive, per-prompt sampling strategy, formulated as a convex optimization problem. The objective function guiding this optimized sampling allocation is designed to reduce the variance of the estimators used to construct the LPB, leading to improved statistical efficiency over naive methods that use a fixed sampling budget per prompt. Experiments on both synthetic and real data support our theoretical results and demonstrate the practical utility of our method for safety risk assessment in generative AI models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can LLMs Hack Enterprise Networks? Autonomous Assumed Breach Penetration-Testing Active Directory Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04227v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Penetration-testing, while critical for validating defenses and uncovering vulnerabilities, is often limited by high operational costs and the scarcity of human expertise. This paper investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of using Large Language Model (LLM)-driven autonomous systems to address these challenges in real-world Microsoft Active Directory (AD) enterprise networks. Our novel prototype, cochise, represents the first demonstration of a fully autonomous, LLM-driven framework capable of compromising accounts within a real-life Microsoft AD testbed (GOAD). The evaluation deliberately utilizes GOAD to capture the intricate interactions and sometimes nondeterministic outcomes of live network pen-testing, moving beyond the limitations of synthetic benchmarks. We perform our empirical evaluation using five LLMs, comparing reasoning to non-reasoning models as well as including open-weight models. Through comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analysis, incorporating insights from cybersecurity experts, we demonstrate that autonomous LLMs can effectively conduct Assumed Breach simulations. Key findings highlight their ability to dynamically adapt attack strategies, perform inter-context attacks, and generate scenario-specific attack parameters. Cochise also exhibits robust self-correction mechanisms, automatically installing missing tools and rectifying invalid command generations. Critically, we find that the associated costs are competitive with those incurred by professional pen-testers, suggesting a path toward democratizing access to essential security testing for organizations with budgetary constraints. However, our research also illuminates existing limitations, including instances of LLM ``going down rabbit holes'', challenges in comprehensive information transfer between planning and execution modules, and critical safety concerns that necessitate human oversight.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Almost Surely Safe Alignment of Large Language Models at Inference-Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01208v3)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel inference-time alignment approach for LLMs that aims to generate safe responses almost surely, i.e., with probability approaching one. Our approach models the generation of safe responses as a constrained Markov Decision Process (MDP) within the LLM's latent space. We augment a safety state that tracks the evolution of safety constraints and dynamically penalize unsafe generations to ensure the generation of safe responses. Consequently, we demonstrate formal safety guarantees w.r.t. the given cost model upon solving the MDP in the latent space with sufficiently large penalties. Building on this foundation, we propose InferenceGuard, a practical implementation that safely aligns LLMs without modifying the model weights. Empirically, we demonstrate that InferenceGuard effectively balances safety and task performance, outperforming existing inference-time alignment methods in generating safe and aligned responses. Our findings contribute to the advancement of safer LLM deployment through alignment at inference-time, thus presenting a promising alternative to resource-intensive, overfitting-prone alignment techniques like RLHF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Effective Complementary Security Analysis using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16899v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key challenge in security analysis is the manual evaluation of potential security weaknesses generated by static application security testing (SAST) tools. Numerous false positives (FPs) in these reports reduce the effectiveness of security analysis. We propose using Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve the assessment of SAST findings. We investigate the ability of LLMs to reduce FPs while trying to maintain a perfect true positive rate, using datasets extracted from the OWASP Benchmark (v1.2) and a real-world software project. Our results indicate that advanced prompting techniques, such as Chain-of-Thought and Self-Consistency, substantially improve FP detection. Notably, some LLMs identified approximately 62.5% of FPs in the OWASP Benchmark dataset without missing genuine weaknesses. Combining detections from different LLMs would increase this FP detection to approximately 78.9%. Additionally, we demonstrate our approach's generalizability using a real-world dataset covering five SAST tools, three programming languages, and infrastructure files. The best LLM detected 33.85% of all FPs without missing genuine weaknesses, while combining detections from different LLMs would increase this detection to 38.46%. Our findings highlight the potential of LLMs to complement traditional SAST tools, enhancing automation and reducing resources spent addressing false alarms.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

To address this critical yet challenging issue, we present a novel gradient-alignment-based method, named LearnAlign, which intelligently selects the learnable and representative training reasoning data for RL post-training. To overcome the issue of response-length bias in gradient norms, we introduce the data learnability based on the success rate, which can indicate the learning potential of each data point. Experiments across three mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly reduces training data requirements while achieving minor performance degradation or even improving performance compared to full-data training. For example, it reduces data requirements by up to 1,000 data points with better performance (77.53%) than that on the full dataset on GSM8K benchmark (77.04%). Furthermore, we show its effectiveness in the staged RL setting. This work provides valuable insights into data-efficient RL post-training and establishes a foundation for future research in optimizing reasoning data selection. To facilitate future work, we will release code.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional techniques, generative AI not only learns patterns and representations from complex data but also enables content generation, data synthesis, and personalized experiences. This generative capability plays a crucial role in the field of recommendation systems, helping to address the issue of data sparsity and improving the overall performance of recommendation systems. Numerous studies on generative AI have already emerged in the field of recommendation systems. Meanwhile, the current requirements for recommendation systems have surpassed the single utility of accuracy, leading to a proliferation of multi-objective research that considers various goals in recommendation systems. However, to the best of our knowledge, there remains a lack of comprehensive studies on multi-objective recommendation systems based on generative AI technologies, leaving a significant gap in the literature. Therefore, we investigate the existing research on multi-objective recommendation systems involving generative AI to bridge this gap. We compile current research on multi-objective recommendation systems based on generative techniques, categorizing them by objectives. Additionally, we summarize relevant evaluation metrics and commonly used datasets, concluding with an analysis of the challenges and future directions in this domain.</p></details> | 21 pages |

We introduce a new manually curated dataset of argument and counter-argument pairs specifically designed to balance argumentative complexity with evaluative feasibility. We also propose a new LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation methodology that shows a stronger correlation with human judgments compared to traditional reference-based metrics. Our experimental results demonstrate that integrating dynamic external knowledge from the web significantly improves the quality of generated counter-arguments, particularly in terms of relatedness, persuasiveness, and factuality. The findings suggest that combining LLMs with real-time external knowledge retrieval offers a promising direction for developing more effective and reliable counter-argumentation systems.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |

However, they also exhibit inherent limitations, such as outdated knowledge and susceptibility to hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm to address these issues, but it also introduces new vulnerabilities. Recent efforts have focused on the security of RAG-based LLMs, yet existing attack methods face three critical challenges: (1) their effectiveness declines sharply when only a limited number of poisoned texts can be injected into the knowledge database, (2) they lack sufficient stealth, as the attacks are often detectable by anomaly detection systems, which compromises their effectiveness, and (3) they rely on heuristic approaches to generate poisoned texts, lacking formal optimization frameworks and theoretic guarantees, which limits their effectiveness and applicability. To address these issues, we propose coordinated Prompt-RAG attack (PR-attack), a novel optimization-driven attack that introduces a small number of poisoned texts into the knowledge database while embedding a backdoor trigger within the prompt. When activated, the trigger causes the LLM to generate pre-designed responses to targeted queries, while maintaining normal behavior in other contexts. This ensures both high effectiveness and stealth. We formulate the attack generation process as a bilevel optimization problem leveraging a principled optimization framework to develop optimal poisoned texts and triggers. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PR-Attack, achieving a high attack success rate even with a limited number of poisoned texts and significantly improved stealth compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

These models pose challenges in diagnosing failures, tracing anomalies, and maintaining transparency, with current manual testing methods being inefficient and labor-intensive. This vision paper presents a methodology that integrates explainability, transparency, and interpretability into V&V processes. We propose refining V&V requirements through literature reviews and stakeholder input, generating explainable test scenarios via large language models (LLMs), and enabling real-time validation in simulation environments. Our framework includes test oracle, explanation generation, and a test chatbot, with empirical studies planned to evaluate improvements in diagnostic efficiency and transparency. Our goal is to streamline V&V, reduce resources, and build user trust in autonomous technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint to be published at SE4ADS</p></details> |
| **[Reward-Agnostic Prompt Optimization for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16853v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate a general approach for improving user prompts in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models by finding prompts that maximize a reward function specified at test-time. Although diverse reward models are used for evaluating image generation, existing automated prompt engineering methods typically target specific reward configurations. Consequently, these specialized designs exhibit suboptimal performance when applied to new prompt engineering scenarios involving different reward models. To address this limitation, we introduce RATTPO (Reward-Agnostic Test-Time Prompt Optimization), a flexible test-time optimization method applicable across various reward scenarios without modification. RATTPO iteratively searches for optimized prompts by querying large language models (LLMs) \textit{without} requiring reward-specific task descriptions. Instead, it uses the optimization trajectory and a novel reward-aware feedback signal (termed a "hint") as context. Empirical results demonstrate the versatility of RATTPO, effectively enhancing user prompts across diverse reward setups that assess various generation aspects, such as aesthetics, general human preference, or spatial relationships between objects. RATTPO surpasses other test-time search baselines in search efficiency, using up to 3.5 times less inference budget, and, given sufficient inference budget, achieves performance comparable to learning-based baselines that require reward-specific fine-tuning. The code is available at https://github.com/seminkim/RATTPO.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, Under review</p></details> |
| **[Adapting While Learning: Grounding LLMs for Scientific Problems with Intelligent Tool Usage Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00412v4)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate promising capabilities in solving scientific problems but often suffer from the issue of hallucination. While integrating LLMs with tools can mitigate this issue, models fine-tuned on tool usage become overreliant on them and incur unnecessary costs. Inspired by how human experts assess problem complexity before selecting solutions, we propose a novel two-component fine-tuning method, Adapting While Learning (AWL). In the first component, World Knowledge Learning (WKL), LLMs internalize scientific knowledge by learning from tool-generated solutions. In the second component, Tool Usage Adaptation (TUA), we categorize problems as easy or hard based on the model's accuracy, and train it to maintain direct reasoning for easy problems while switching to tools for hard ones. We validate our method on six scientific benchmark datasets across climate science, epidemiology, physics, and other domains. Compared to the original instruct model (8B), models post-trained with AWL achieve 29.11% higher answer accuracy and 12.72% better tool usage accuracy, even surpassing state-of-the-art models including GPT-4o and Claude-3.5 on four custom-created datasets. Our code is open-source at https://github.com/Rose-STL-Lab/Adapting-While-Learning.</p></details> | 37 pages, 16 figures |
| **[More Thinking, Less Seeing? Assessing Amplified Hallucination in Multimodal Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21523v3)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time compute has empowered multimodal large language models to generate extended reasoning chains, yielding strong performance on tasks such as multimodal math reasoning. However, this improved reasoning ability often comes with increased hallucination: as generations become longer, models tend to drift away from image-grounded content and rely more heavily on language priors. Attention analysis shows that longer reasoning chains lead to reduced focus on visual inputs, which contributes to hallucination. To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce RH-AUC, a metric that quantifies how a model's perception accuracy changes with reasoning length, allowing us to evaluate whether the model preserves visual grounding during reasoning. We also release RH-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark that spans a variety of multimodal tasks, designed to assess the trade-off between reasoning ability and hallucination. Our analysis reveals that (i) larger models typically achieve a better balance between reasoning and perception, and (ii) this balance is influenced more by the types and domains of training data than by its overall volume. These findings underscore the importance of evaluation frameworks that jointly consider both reasoning quality and perceptual fidelity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting New Research Directions in Materials Science using Large Language Models and Concept Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16824v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to an exponential increase in published research articles, it is impossible for individual scientists to read all publications, even within their own research field. In this work, we investigate the use of large language models (LLMs) for the purpose of extracting the main concepts and semantic information from scientific abstracts in the domain of materials science to find links that were not noticed by humans and thus to suggest inspiring near/mid-term future research directions. We show that LLMs can extract concepts more efficiently than automated keyword extraction methods to build a concept graph as an abstraction of the scientific literature. A machine learning model is trained to predict emerging combinations of concepts, i.e. new research ideas, based on historical data. We demonstrate that integrating semantic concept information leads to an increased prediction performance. The applicability of our model is demonstrated in qualitative interviews with domain experts based on individualized model suggestions. We show that the model can inspire materials scientists in their creative thinking process by predicting innovative combinations of topics that have not yet been investigated.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cost-effective Instruction Learning for Pathology Vision and Language Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17734v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of vision-language models fosters the interactive conversations between AI-enabled models and humans. Yet applying these models into clinics must deal with daunting challenges around large-scale training data, financial, and computational resources. Here we propose a cost-effective instruction learning framework for conversational pathology named as CLOVER. CLOVER only trains a lightweight module and uses instruction tuning while freezing the parameters of the large language model. Instead of using costly GPT-4, we propose well-designed prompts on GPT-3.5 for building generation-based instructions, emphasizing the utility of pathological knowledge derived from the Internet source. To augment the use of instructions, we construct a high-quality set of template-based instructions in the context of digital pathology. From two benchmark datasets, our findings reveal the strength of hybrid-form instructions in the visual question-answer in pathology. Extensive results show the cost-effectiveness of CLOVER in answering both open-ended and closed-ended questions, where CLOVER outperforms strong baselines that possess 37 times more training parameters and use instruction data generated from GPT-4. Through the instruction tuning, CLOVER exhibits robustness of few-shot learning in the external clinical dataset. These findings demonstrate that cost-effective modeling of CLOVER could accelerate the adoption of rapid conversational applications in the landscape of digital pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ask, Fail, Repeat: Meeseeks, an Iterative Feedback Benchmark for LLMs' Multi-turn Instruction-Following Ability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21625v4)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to follow instructions accurately is fundamental for Large Language Models (LLMs) to serve as reliable agents in real-world applications. For complex instructions, LLMs often struggle to fulfill all requirements in a single attempt. In practice, users typically provide iterative feedback until the LLM generates a response that meets all requirements. However, existing instruction-following benchmarks are either single-turn or introduce new requirements in each turn without allowing self-correction. To address this gap, we propose Meeseeks. Meeseeks simulates realistic human-LLM interactions through an iterative feedback framework, which enables models to self-correct based on specific requirement failures in each turn, better reflecting real-world user-end usage patterns. Meanwhile, the benchmark implements a comprehensive evaluation system with 38 capability tags organized across three dimensions: Intent Recognition, Granular Content Validation, and Output Structure Validation. Through rigorous evaluation across LLMs, Meeseeks provides valuable insights into LLMs' instruction-following capabilities in multi-turn scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods struggle with an accurate understanding of degraded image content, leading to reconstructed results that are both low-fidelity and unnatural. We present RealSR-R1 in this work, which empowers the RealSR models with understanding and reasoning capabilities. Inspired by the success of Chain of Thought (CoT) in large language models (LLMs), we simulate the human process of handling degraded images and propose the VLCoT framework, which integrates vision and language reasoning. The framework aims to precisely restore image details by progressively generating more comprehensive text and higher-resolution images. To overcome the challenge of traditional supervised learning CoT failing to generalize to real-world scenarios, we introduce, for the first time, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) into the Real-World Image Super-Resolution task. We propose VLCoT-GRPO as a solution, which designs four reward functions: (1) Format reward, used to standardize the CoT process; (2) Degradation reward, to incentivize accurate degradation estimation; (3) Understanding reward, to ensure the accuracy of the generated content; and (4) Generation reward, where we propose using a visual expert model to evaluate the quality of generated images, encouraging the model to generate more realistic images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed RealSR-R1 can generate realistic details and accurately understand image content, particularly in semantically rich scenes or images with severe degradation.</p></details> |  |

Jailbreaking black-box LLMs is considered challenging due to the discrete nature of token inputs, restricted access to the target LLM, and limited query budget. To address the issues above, we propose an effective method for jailbreaking black-box large language Models via Iterative Semantic Tuning, named MIST. MIST enables attackers to iteratively refine prompts that preserve the original semantic intent while inducing harmful content. Specifically, to balance semantic similarity with computational efficiency, MIST incorporates two key strategies: sequential synonym search, and its advanced version--order-determining optimization. Extensive experiments across two open-source models and four closed-source models demonstrate that MIST achieves competitive attack success rates and attack transferability compared with other state-of-the-art white-box and black-box jailbreak methods. Additionally, we conduct experiments on computational efficiency to validate the practical viability of MIST.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |

However, heuristics designed by humans require too much domain knowledge and testing time. Since Large Language Models~(LLMs) possess strong capabilities to understand and generate content with a knowledge base that covers various domains, they offer potential ways to automatically optimize heuristics. To this end, we propose Planning of Heuristics~(PoH), an optimization method that integrates LLM self-reflection with Monte Carlo Tree Search, a well-known planning algorithm. PoH iteratively refines generated heuristics by evaluating their performance and providing improvement suggestions. Our method enables to iteratively evaluate the generated heuristics~(states) and improve them based on the improvement suggestions~(actions) and evaluation results~(rewards), by effectively simulating future states to search for paths with higher rewards. In this paper, we apply PoH to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem and the Flow Shop Scheduling Problem. The experimental results show that PoH outperforms hand-crafted heuristics and other Automatic Heuristic Design methods based on LLMs, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance in automating heuristic optimization with LLMs to solve tested COPs, especially with large sizes.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures |

However, current practices are often constrained by inefficient and biased hypothesis formulation, challenges in integrating multimodal data, and fragile experimental methodologies. Imagine a system that automatically estimates the causal impact of congestion pricing on commute times by income group or measures how new green spaces affect asthma rates across neighborhoods using satellite imagery and health reports, and then generates comprehensive, policy-ready outputs, including causal estimates, subgroup analyses, and actionable recommendations. In this Perspective, we propose UrbanCIA, an LLM-driven conceptual framework composed of four distinct modular agents responsible for hypothesis generation, data engineering, experiment design and execution, and results interpretation with policy insights. We begin by examining the current landscape of urban causal research through a structured taxonomy of research topics, data sources, and methodological approaches, revealing systemic limitations across the workflow. Next, we introduce the design principles and technological roadmap for the four modules in the proposed framework. We also propose evaluation criteria to assess the rigor and transparency of these AI-augmented processes. Finally, we reflect on the broader implications for human-AI collaboration, equity, and accountability. We call for a new research agenda that embraces LLM-driven tools as catalysts for more scalable, reproducible, and inclusive urban research.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeV-R1: Reasoning-Enhanced Verilog Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24183v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) trained via reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) have achieved breakthroughs on tasks with explicit, automatable verification, such as software programming and mathematical problems. Extending RLVR to electronic design automation (EDA), especially automatically generating hardware description languages (HDLs) like Verilog from natural-language (NL) specifications, however, poses three key challenges: the lack of automated and accurate verification environments, the scarcity of high-quality NL-code pairs, and the prohibitive computation cost of RLVR. To this end, we introduce CodeV-R1, an RLVR framework for training Verilog generation LLMs. First, we develop a rule-based testbench generator that performs robust equivalence checking against golden references. Second, we propose a round-trip data synthesis method that pairs open-source Verilog snippets with LLM-generated NL descriptions, verifies code-NL-code consistency via the generated testbench, and filters out inequivalent examples to yield a high-quality dataset. Third, we employ a two-stage "distill-then-RL" training pipeline: distillation for the cold start of reasoning abilities, followed by adaptive DAPO, our novel RLVR algorithm that can reduce training cost by adaptively adjusting sampling rate. The resulting model, CodeV-R1-7B, achieves 68.6% and 72.9% pass@1 on VerilogEval v2 and RTLLM v1.1, respectively, surpassing prior state-of-the-art by 12~20%, while matching or even exceeding the performance of 671B DeepSeek-R1. We will release our model, training pipeline, and dataset to facilitate research in EDA and LLM communities.</p></details> |  |

We present Distillnote, a framework for LLM-based clinical note summarization, and generate over 64,000 admission note summaries through three techniques: (1) One-step, direct summarization, and a divide-and-conquer approach involving (2) Structured summarization focused on independent clinical insights, and (3) Distilled summarization that further condenses the Structured summaries. We test how useful are the summaries by using them to predict heart failure compared to a model trained on the original notes. Distilled summaries achieve 79% text compression and up to 18.2% improvement in AUPRC compared to an LLM trained on the full notes. We also evaluate the quality of the generated summaries in an LLM-as-judge evaluation as well as through blinded pairwise comparisons with clinicians. Evaluations indicate that one-step summaries are favoured by clinicians according to relevance and clinical actionability, while distilled summaries offer optimal efficiency (avg. 6.9x compression-to-performance ratio) and significantly reduce hallucinations. We release our summaries on PhysioNet to encourage future research.</p></details> |  |

However, most advanced MT-specific LLMs heavily rely on external supervision signals during training, such as human-annotated reference data or trained reward models (RMs), which are often expensive to obtain and challenging to scale. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Simple Self-Rewarding (SSR) Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for MT that is reference-free, fully online, and relies solely on self-judging rewards. Training with SSR using 13K monolingual examples and Qwen-2.5-7B as the backbone, our model SSR-Zero-7B outperforms existing MT-specific LLMs, e.g., TowerInstruct-13B and GemmaX-28-9B, as well as larger general LLMs like Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct in English $\leftrightarrow$ Chinese translation tasks from WMT23, WMT24, and Flores200 benchmarks. Furthermore, by augmenting SSR with external supervision from COMET, our strongest model, SSR-X-Zero-7B, achieves state-of-the-art performance in English $\leftrightarrow$ Chinese translation, surpassing all existing open-source models under 72B parameters and even outperforming closed-source models, e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro. Our analysis highlights the effectiveness of the self-rewarding mechanism compared to the external LLM-as-a-judge approach in MT and demonstrates its complementary benefits when combined with trained RMs. Our findings provide valuable insight into the potential of self-improving RL methods. We have publicly released our code, data and models.</p></details> |  |

The system combines a Text-to-SQL planner with a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, enabling natural language access to both relational data and free-form documents. To enhance answer faithfulness, the RAG module integrates dense and sparse retrieval, commercial reranking, and a citation verification loop that ensures grounding consistency. We evaluate eSapiens on the RAGTruth benchmark across five leading large language models (LLMs), analyzing performance across key dimensions such as completeness, hallucination, and context utilization. Results demonstrate that eSapiens outperforms a FAISS baseline in contextual relevance and generation quality, with optional strict-grounding controls for high-stakes scenarios. This work provides a deployable framework for robust, citation-aware question answering in real-world enterprise applications.</p></details> |  |

We conducted a formative study on travelers' information needs, finding that most of them turn to search engines for trip planning. Search engines, however, fail to provide easily interpretable results adapted to the context and personal information needs of a traveler. Large language models (LLMs) create new possibilities for providing personalized travel safety advice. To explore this idea, we developed DangerMaps, a mapping system that assists its users in researching the safety of an urban travel destination, whether it is pre-travel or on-location. DangerMaps plots safety ratings onto a map and provides explanations on demand. This late breaking work specifically emphasizes the challenges of designing real-world applications with large language models.

To assess how well current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have acquired this fundamental capability, we introduce LEGO-Puzzles, a scalable benchmark designed to evaluate both spatial understanding and sequential reasoning in MLLMs through LEGO-based tasks. LEGO-Puzzles consists of 1,100 carefully curated visual question-answering (VQA) samples spanning 11 distinct tasks, ranging from basic spatial understanding to complex multi-step reasoning. Based on LEGO-Puzzles, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs and uncover significant limitations in their spatial reasoning capabilities: even the most powerful MLLMs can answer only about half of the test cases, whereas human participants achieve over 90% accuracy. Furthermore, based on LEGO-Puzzles, we design generation tasks to investigate whether MLLMs can transfer their spatial understanding and reasoning abilities to image generation. Our experiments show that only GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0-Flash exhibit a limited ability to follow these instructions, while other MLLMs either replicate the input image or generate completely irrelevant outputs. Overall, LEGO-Puzzles exposes critical deficiencies in existing MLLMs' spatial understanding and sequential reasoning capabilities, and underscores the need for further advancements in multimodal spatial reasoning.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

Due to the high cost of crowdsourcing a large ESC corpus, recent attempts use large language models for dialogue augmentation. However, existing approaches largely overlook the social dynamics inherent in ESC, leading to less effective simulations. In this paper, we introduce SocialSim, a novel framework that simulates ESC by integrating key aspects of social interactions: social disclosure and social awareness. On the seeker side, we facilitate social disclosure by constructing a comprehensive persona bank that captures diverse and authentic help-seeking scenarios. On the supporter side, we enhance social awareness by eliciting cognitive reasoning to generate logical and supportive responses. Building upon SocialSim, we construct SSConv, a large-scale synthetic ESC corpus of which quality can even surpass crowdsourced ESC data. We further train a chatbot on SSConv and demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance in both automatic and human evaluations. We believe SocialSim offers a scalable way to synthesize ESC, making emotional care more accessible and practical.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2025 Paper #32116 (Without Publication Edits)</p></details> |

However, the prevalent black-box Application Programming Interface (API) access to many LLMs introduces significant challenges in accountability, governance, and security. LLM fingerprinting, which aims to identify the source model by analyzing statistical and stylistic features of generated text, offers a potential solution. Current progress in this area is hindered by a lack of dedicated datasets and the need for efficient, practical methods that are robust against adversarial manipulations. To address these challenges, we introduce FD-Dataset, a comprehensive bilingual fingerprinting benchmark comprising 90,000 text samples from 20 famous proprietary and open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we present FDLLM, a novel fingerprinting method that leverages parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune a foundation model. This approach enables LoRA to extract deep, persistent features that characterize each source LLM. Through our analysis, we find that LoRA adaptation promotes the aggregation of outputs from the same LLM in representation space while enhancing the separation between different LLMs. This mechanism explains why LoRA proves particularly effective for LLM fingerprinting. Extensive empirical evaluations on FD-Dataset demonstrate FDLLM's superiority, achieving a Macro F1 score 22.1% higher than the strongest baseline. FDLLM also exhibits strong generalization to newly released models, achieving an average accuracy of 95% on unseen models. Notably, FDLLM remains consistently robust under various adversarial attacks, including polishing, translation, and synonym substitution. Experimental results show that FDLLM reduces the average attack success rate from 49.2% (LM-D) to 23.9%.</p></details> |  |

Some approaches utilize synthetic data generated by advanced LLMs based on evaluation results to train models. However, conventional evaluation methods fail to provide detailed, fine-grained profiles of LLMs, limiting their guidance for data synthesis. In this paper, we introduce the Cognitive Diagnostic Synthesis (CDS) method, which incorporates a diagnostic process inspired by Cognitive Diagnosis Theory (CDT) to refine evaluation results and characterize model profiles at the knowledge component level. Based on these diagnostics, we propose two diagnosis-synthesis strategies for weakness-targeted data synthesis. Additionally, we present an enhanced data augmentation and selection pipeline to improve the quality and diversity of synthesized data. Our experiments with several open-source models show significant improvements across multiple benchmarks, achieving up to 6.00% improvement in code generation, 13.10% in mathematical reasoning, and 5.43% in academic exams.

| **[The Role of Model Confidence on Bias Effects in Measured Uncertainties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16724v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) for open-ended tasks, accurately assessing epistemic uncertainty, which reflects a model's lack of knowledge, has become crucial to ensuring reliable outcomes. However, quantifying epistemic uncertainty in such tasks is challenging due to the presence of aleatoric uncertainty, which arises from multiple valid answers. While bias can introduce noise into epistemic uncertainty estimation, it may also reduce noise from aleatoric uncertainty. To investigate this trade-off, we conduct experiments on Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks and find that mitigating prompt-introduced bias improves uncertainty quantification in GPT-4o. Building on prior work showing that LLMs tend to copy input information when model confidence is low, we further analyze how these prompt biases affect measured epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty across varying bias-free confidence levels with GPT-4o and Qwen2-VL. We find that all considered biases induce greater changes in both uncertainties when bias-free model confidence is lower. Moreover, lower bias-free model confidence leads to greater underestimation of epistemic uncertainty (i.e. overconfidence) due to bias, whereas it has no significant effect on the direction of changes in aleatoric uncertainty estimation. These distinct effects deepen our understanding of bias mitigation for uncertainty quantification and potentially inform the development of more advanced techniques.</p></details> |  |

However, creating the training dataset for their skill acquisition faces several challenges. Manual trajectory collection requires significant human effort. Another approach, where LLMs directly propose tasks to learn, is often invalid, as the LLMs lack knowledge of which tasks are actually feasible. Moreover, the generated data may not provide a meaningful learning signal, as agents often already perform well on the proposed tasks. To address this, we propose a novel automatic skill discovery framework EXIF for LLM-powered agents, designed to improve the feasibility of generated target behaviors while accounting for the agents' capabilities. Our method adopts an exploration-first strategy by employing an exploration agent (Alice) to train the target agent (Bob) to learn essential skills in the environment. Specifically, Alice first interacts with the environment to retrospectively generate a feasible, environment-grounded skill dataset, which is then used to train Bob. Crucially, we incorporate an iterative feedback loop, where Alice evaluates Bob's performance to identify areas for improvement. This feedback then guides Alice's next round of exploration, forming a closed-loop data generation process. Experiments on Webshop and Crafter demonstrate EXIF's ability to effectively discover meaningful skills and iteratively expand the capabilities of the trained agent without any human intervention, achieving substantial performance improvements. Interestingly, we observe that setting Alice to the same model as Bob also notably improves performance, demonstrating EXIF's potential for building a self-evolving system.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under review</p></details> |
| **[Revisiting Multi-Agent Debate as Test-Time Scaling: A Systematic Study of Conditional Effectiveness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22960v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable growth in large language model (LLM) capabilities has spurred exploration into multi-agent systems, with debate frameworks emerging as a promising avenue for enhanced problem-solving. These multi-agent debate (MAD) approaches, where agents collaboratively present, critique, and refine arguments, potentially offer improved reasoning, robustness, and diverse perspectives over monolithic models. Despite prior studies leveraging MAD, a systematic understanding of its effectiveness compared to self-agent methods, particularly under varying conditions, remains elusive. This paper seeks to fill this gap by conceptualizing MAD as a test-time computational scaling technique, distinguished by collaborative refinement and diverse exploration capabilities. We conduct a comprehensive empirical investigation comparing MAD with strong self-agent test-time scaling baselines on mathematical reasoning and safety-related tasks. Our study systematically examines the influence of task difficulty, model scale, and agent diversity on MAD's performance. Key findings reveal that, for mathematical reasoning, MAD offers limited advantages over self-agent scaling but becomes more effective with increased problem difficulty and decreased model capability, while agent diversity shows little benefit. Conversely, for safety tasks, MAD's collaborative refinement can increase vulnerability, but incorporating diverse agent configurations facilitates a gradual reduction in attack success through the collaborative refinement process. We believe our findings provide critical guidance for the future development of more effective and strategically deployed MAD systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under review</p></details> |

This Perspective maps out principles and methods for using generative artificial intelligence (AI), specifically large language models (LLMs), to elevate the quality and efficiency of academic writing. We introduce a human-AI collaborative framework that delineates the rationale (why), process (how), and nature (what) of AI engagement in writing. The framework pinpoints both short-term and long-term reasons for engagement and their underlying mechanisms (e.g., cognitive offloading and imaginative stimulation). It reveals the role of AI throughout the writing process, conceptualized through a two-stage model for human-AI collaborative writing, and the nature of AI assistance in writing, represented through a model of writing-assistance types and levels. Building on this framework, we describe effective prompting techniques for incorporating AI into the writing routine (outlining, drafting, and editing) as well as strategies for maintaining rigorous scholarship, adhering to varied journal policies, and avoiding overreliance on AI. Ultimately, the prudent integration of AI into academic writing can ease the communication burden, empower authors, accelerate discovery, and promote diversity in science.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in: Nature Biomedical Engineering, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Beyond principlism: Practical strategies for ethical AI use in research practices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15284v6)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in scientific research, particularly large language models (LLMs), has outpaced the development of ethical guidelines, leading to a "Triple-Too" problem: too many high-level ethical initiatives, too abstract principles lacking contextual and practical relevance, and too much focus on restrictions and risks over benefits and utilities. Existing approaches--principlism (reliance on abstract ethical principles), formalism (rigid application of rules), and technological solutionism (overemphasis on technological fixes)--offer little practical guidance for addressing ethical challenges of AI in scientific research practices. To bridge the gap between abstract principles and day-to-day research practices, a user-centered, realism-inspired approach is proposed here. It outlines five specific goals for ethical AI use: 1) understanding model training and output, including bias mitigation strategies; 2) respecting privacy, confidentiality, and copyright; 3) avoiding plagiarism and policy violations; 4) applying AI beneficially compared to alternatives; and 5) using AI transparently and reproducibly. Each goal is accompanied by actionable strategies and realistic cases of misuse and corrective measures. I argue that ethical AI application requires evaluating its utility against existing alternatives rather than isolated performance metrics. Additionally, I propose documentation guidelines to enhance transparency and reproducibility in AI-assisted research. Moving forward, we need targeted professional development, training programs, and balanced enforcement mechanisms to promote responsible AI use while fostering innovation. By refining these ethical guidelines and adapting them to emerging AI capabilities, we can accelerate scientific progress without compromising research integrity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in: AI and Ethics, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Six Fallacies in Substituting Large Language Models for Human Participants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04470v5)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Can AI systems like large language models (LLMs) replace human participants in behavioral and psychological research? Here I critically evaluate the "replacement" perspective and identify six interpretive fallacies that undermine its validity. These fallacies are: (1) equating token prediction with human intelligence, (2) treating LLMs as the average human, (3) interpreting alignment as explanation, (4) anthropomorphizing AI systems, (5) essentializing identities, and (6) substituting model data for human evidence. Each fallacy represents a potential misunderstanding about what LLMs are and what they can tell us about human cognition. The analysis distinguishes levels of similarity between LLMs and humans, particularly functional equivalence (outputs) versus mechanistic equivalence (processes), while highlighting both technical limitations (addressable through engineering) and conceptual limitations (arising from fundamental differences between statistical and biological intelligence). For each fallacy, specific safeguards are provided to guide responsible research practices. Ultimately, the analysis supports conceptualizing LLMs as pragmatic simulation tools--useful for role-play, rapid hypothesis testing, and computational modeling (provided their outputs are validated against human data)--rather than as replacements for human participants. This framework enables researchers to leverage language models productively while respecting the fundamental differences between machine intelligence and human thought.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models as Psychological Simulators: A Methodological Guide](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16702v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) offer emerging opportunities for psychological and behavioral research, but methodological guidance is lacking. This article provides a framework for using LLMs as psychological simulators across two primary applications: simulating roles and personas to explore diverse contexts, and serving as computational models to investigate cognitive processes. For simulation, we present methods for developing psychologically grounded personas that move beyond demographic categories, with strategies for validation against human data and use cases ranging from studying inaccessible populations to prototyping research instruments. For cognitive modeling, we synthesize emerging approaches for probing internal representations, methodological advances in causal interventions, and strategies for relating model behavior to human cognition. We address overarching challenges including prompt sensitivity, temporal limitations from training data cutoffs, and ethical considerations that extend beyond traditional human subjects review. Throughout, we emphasize the need for transparency about model capabilities and constraints. Together, this framework integrates emerging empirical evidence about LLM performance--including systematic biases, cultural limitations, and prompt brittleness--to help researchers wrangle these challenges and leverage the unique capabilities of LLMs in psychological research.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphRAG-Bench: Challenging Domain-Specific Reasoning for Evaluating Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02404v3)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has garnered increasing recognition for its potential to enhance large language models (LLMs) by structurally organizing domain-specific corpora and facilitating complex reasoning. However, current evaluations of GraphRAG models predominantly rely on traditional question-answering datasets. Their limited scope in questions and evaluation metrics fails to comprehensively assess the reasoning capacity improvements enabled by GraphRAG models. To address this gap, we introduce GraphRAG-Bench, a large-scale, domain-specific benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate GraphRAG models. Our benchmark offers three key superiorities: \((i)\) Challenging question design. Featuring college-level, domain-specific questions that demand multi-hop reasoning, the benchmark ensures that simple content retrieval is insufficient for problem-solving. For example, some questions require mathematical reasoning or programming. \((ii)\) Diverse task coverage. The dataset includes a broad spectrum of reasoning tasks, multiple-choice, true/false, multi-select, open-ended, and fill-in-the-blank. It spans 16 disciplines in twenty core textbooks. \((iii)\) Holistic evaluation framework. GraphRAG-Bench provides comprehensive assessment across the entire GraphRAG pipeline, including graph construction, knowledge retrieval, and answer generation. Beyond final-answer correctness, it evaluates the logical coherence of the reasoning process. By applying nine contemporary GraphRAG methods to GraphRAG-Bench, we demonstrate its utility in quantifying how graph-based structuring improves model reasoning capabilities. Our analysis reveals critical insights about graph architectures, retrieval efficacy, and reasoning capabilities, offering actionable guidance for the research community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Traffic Simulation and Cybersecurity Strategies Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16699v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are increasingly vulnerable to sophisticated cyberattacks due to their complex, interconnected nature. Ensuring the cybersecurity of these systems is paramount to maintaining road safety and minimizing traffic disruptions. This study presents a novel multi-agent framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance traffic simulation and cybersecurity testing. The framework automates the creation of traffic scenarios, the design of cyberattack strategies, and the development of defense mechanisms. A case study demonstrates the framework's ability to simulate a cyberattack targeting connected vehicle broadcasts, evaluate its impact, and implement a defense mechanism that significantly mitigates traffic delays. Results show a 10.2 percent increase in travel time during an attack, which is reduced by 3.3 percent with the defense strategy. This research highlights the potential of LLM-driven multi-agent systems in advancing transportation cybersecurity and offers a scalable approach for future research in traffic simulation and cyber defense.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Prompts to Constructs: A Dual-Validity Framework for LLM Research in Psychology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16697v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted across psychology, serving as research tools, experimental subjects, human simulators, and computational models of cognition. However, the application of human measurement tools to these systems can produce contradictory results, raising concerns that many findings are measurement phantoms--statistical artifacts rather than genuine psychological phenomena. In this Perspective, we argue that building a robust science of AI psychology requires integrating two of our field's foundational pillars: the principles of reliable measurement and the standards for sound causal inference. We present a dual-validity framework to guide this integration, which clarifies how the evidence needed to support a claim scales with its scientific ambition. Using an LLM to classify text may require only basic accuracy checks, whereas claiming it can simulate anxiety demands a far more rigorous validation process. Current practice systematically fails to meet these requirements, often treating statistical pattern matching as evidence of psychological phenomena. The same model output--endorsing "I am anxious"--requires different validation strategies depending on whether researchers claim to measure, characterize, simulate, or model psychological constructs. Moving forward requires developing computational analogues of psychological constructs and establishing clear, scalable standards of evidence rather than the uncritical application of human measurement tools.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we evaluate the performance of two LLM- based diagnostic tools, DeepSeek R1 and O3 Mini, using a structured dataset of symptoms and diagnoses. We assessed their predictive accuracy at both the disease and category levels, as well as the reliability of their confidence scores. DeepSeek R1 achieved a disease-level accuracy of 76% and an overall accuracy of 82%, outperforming O3 Mini, which attained 72% and 75% respectively. Notably, DeepSeek R1 demonstrated exceptional performance in Mental Health, Neurological Disorders, and Oncology, where it reached 100% accuracy, while O3 Mini excelled in Autoimmune Disease classification with 100% accuracy. Both models, however, struggled with Respiratory Disease classification, recording accuracies of only 40% for DeepSeek R1 and 20% for O3 Mini. Additionally, the analysis of confidence scores revealed that DeepSeek R1 provided high-confidence predictions in 92% of cases, compared to 68% for O3 Mini. Ethical considerations regarding bias, model interpretability, and data privacy are also discussed to ensure the responsible integration of LLMs into clinical practice. Overall, our findings offer valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of LLM-based diagnostic systems and provide a roadmap for future enhancements in AI-driven healthcare.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |

We introduce a novel framework, LegiGPT, which integrates a large language model (LLM) with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to analyze transportation-related legislative proposals. LegiGPT employs a multi-stage filtering and classification pipeline using zero-shot prompting with GPT-4. Using legislative data from South Korea's 21st National Assembly, we identify key factors - including sponsor characteristics, political affiliations, and geographic variables - that significantly influence transportation policymaking. The LLM was used to classify transportation-related bill proposals through a stepwise filtering process based on keywords, phrases, and contextual relevance. XAI techniques were then applied to examine relationships between party affiliation and associated attributes. The results reveal that the number and proportion of conservative and progressive sponsors, along with district size and electoral population, are critical determinants shaping legislative outcomes. These findings suggest that both parties contributed to bipartisan legislation through different forms of engagement, such as initiating or supporting proposals. This integrated approach provides a valuable tool for understanding legislative dynamics and guiding future policy development, with broader implications for infrastructure planning and governance.</p></details> |  |

Current methods either disrupt the model's inherent structure or introduce severe long-context computational burden, severely limiting scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we rethink multimodal integration and present LaVi, a novel LVLM that enables seamless and efficient vision-language fusion through internal feature modulation within the Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike dominant LVLMs that rely on visual token concatenation, LaVi bypasses long-context expansion by introducing a lightweight and adaptive transformation, which incorporates visual context by injecting token-wise vision-conditioned deltas into the affine parameters of layer normalization. This mechanism directly modulates linguistic hidden states based on visual input, ensuring precise vision-language alignment while preserving the LLM's linguistic priors and drastically reducing computational costs. Extensive evaluations across 15 image and video benchmarks demonstrate that LaVi not only achieves state-of-the-art multimodal performance but also dramatically enhances efficiency. Compared to LLaVA-OV-7B, LaVi reduces FLOPs by 94.0%, improves inference speed by 3.1 times, and cuts memory usage in half - establishing LaVi as a scalable and practical solution for real-time multimodal reasoning. The code and models will be released soon.</p></details> |  |

While this suggests internalized understanding of hierarchical syntax and dependency relations, the precise mechanism by which they represent syntactic structure is an open area within interpretability research. Probing provides one way to identify the mechanism of syntax being linearly encoded in activations, however, no comprehensive study has yet established whether a model's probing accuracy reliably predicts its downstream syntactic performance. Adopting a "mechanisms vs. outcomes" framework, we evaluate 32 open-weight transformer models and find that syntactic features extracted via probing fail to predict outcomes of targeted syntax evaluations across English linguistic phenomena. Our results highlight a substantial disconnect between latent syntactic representations found via probing and observable syntactic behaviors in downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |

Despite this variety, a unified framework for delivering high-quality medical QA has yet to emerge. Although recent progress in reasoning-augmented large language models (LLMs) has shown promise, their ability to achieve comprehensive medical understanding is still largely unexplored. In this paper, we present Med-U1, a unified framework for robust reasoning across medical QA tasks with diverse output formats, ranging from MCQs to complex generation and computation tasks. Med-U1 employs pure large-scale reinforcement learning with mixed rule-based binary reward functions, incorporating a length penalty to manage output verbosity. With multi-objective reward optimization, Med-U1 directs LLMs to produce concise and verifiable reasoning chains. Empirical results reveal that Med-U1 significantly improves performance across multiple challenging Med-QA benchmarks, surpassing even larger specialized and proprietary models. Furthermore, Med-U1 demonstrates robust generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. Extensive analysis presents insights into training strategies, reasoning chain length control, and reward design for medical LLMs. Our code is available here.</p></details> |  |

However, a pressing issue arises: Can the safety risk principles designed and aligned for general MLLMs in dialogue scenarios be effectively transferred to real-world computer-use scenarios? Existing research on evaluating the safety risks of MLLM-based computer-use agents suffers from several limitations: it either lacks realistic interactive environments, or narrowly focuses on one or a few specific risk types. These limitations ignore the complexity, variability, and diversity of real-world environments, thereby restricting comprehensive risk evaluation for computer-use agents. To this end, we introduce \textbf{RiOSWorld}, a benchmark designed to evaluate the potential risks of MLLM-based agents during real-world computer manipulations. Our benchmark includes 492 risky tasks spanning various computer applications, involving web, social media, multimedia, os, email, and office software. We categorize these risks into two major classes based on their risk source: (i) User-originated risks and (ii) Environmental risks. For the evaluation, we evaluate safety risks from two perspectives: (i) Risk goal intention and (ii) Risk goal completion. Extensive experiments with multimodal agents on \textbf{RiOSWorld} demonstrate that current computer-use agents confront significant safety risks in real-world scenarios. Our findings highlight the necessity and urgency of safety alignment for computer-use agents in real-world computer manipulation, providing valuable insights for developing trustworthy computer-use agents.

To ensure such decisions are consistent, prevailing processes primarily make use of high-level rules and guidelines to ground decisions, similar to applying "constitutions" in the legal context. However, inconsistencies in specifying and interpreting constitutional grounding can lead to undesirable and even incorrect decisions being made. In this work, we introduce "case law grounding" (CLG) -- an approach for grounding subjective decision-making using past decisions, similar to how precedents are used in case law. We present how this grounding approach can be implemented in both human and AI decision-making contexts, introducing both a human-led process and a large language model (LLM) prompting setup. Evaluating with five groups and communities across two decision-making task domains, we find that decisions produced with CLG were significantly more accurately aligned to ground truth in 4 out of 5 groups, achieving a 16.0--23.3 %-points higher accuracy in the human process, and 20.8--32.9 %-points higher with LLMs. We also examined the impact of different configurations with the retrieval window size and binding nature of decisions and find that binding decisions and larger retrieval windows were beneficial. Finally, we discuss the broader implications of using CLG to augment existing constitutional grounding when it comes to aligning human and AI decisions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACM Collective Intelligence 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Minimalist Optimizer Design for LLM Pretraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16659v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training large language models (LLMs) typically relies on adaptive optimizers such as Adam, which require significant memory to maintain first- and second-moment matrices, known as optimizer states. While recent works such as GaLore, Fira, and APOLLO have proposed state-compressed variants to reduce memory consumption, a fundamental question remains: What is the minimal amount of optimizer state that is truly necessary to retain state-of-the-art performance in LLM pretraining? In this work, we systematically investigate this question using a bottom-up approach. We find that two memory- and compute-efficient optimization techniques are particularly effective: (1) column-wise gradient normalization significantly boosts the performance of plain SGD without requiring momentum; and (2) adding first-order momentum only to the output layer - where gradient variance is highest - yields performance competitive with fully adaptive methods such as Muon. Based on these insights, we propose SCALE (Stochastic Column-normalized Last-layer Momentum), a new optimizer that combines column-normalized SGD with last-layer momentum, where column normalization refers to normalizing the gradient along the output dimension. Across multiple LLaMA models (60M-1B), SCALE matches or exceeds the performance of Adam while using only 35-45% of the total memory. It also consistently outperforms memory-efficient optimizers such as GaLore, Fira, and APOLLO, making it a strong candidate for large-scale pretraining under memory constraints. For the LLaMA 7B model, SCALE outperforms the state-of-the-art method APOLLO in terms of both perplexity and memory consumption. In addition, our method serves as a minimalist baseline for more sophisticated optimizer design.</p></details> |  |

However, existing LLM routing approaches are limited in two key ways: they evaluate performance using benchmarks that often fail to capture human preferences driven by subjective evaluation criteria, and they typically select from a limited pool of models. In this work, we propose a preference-aligned routing framework that guides model selection by matching queries to user-defined domains (e.g., travel) or action types (e.g., image editing) -- offering a practical mechanism to encode preferences in routing decisions. Specifically, we introduce \textbf{Arch-Router}, a compact 1.5B model that learns to map queries to domain-action preferences for model routing decisions. Our approach also supports seamlessly adding new models for routing without requiring retraining or architectural modifications. Experiments on conversational datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in matching queries with human preferences, outperforming top proprietary models. Our approach captures subjective evaluation criteria and makes routing decisions more transparent and flexible. Our model is available at: \texttt{https://huggingface.co/katanemo/Arch-Router-1.5B}.</p></details> |  |

We analyze two: DeepSeek-V3, a 671-billion-parameter Mixture of Experts large language model (LLM) exemplifying scale-driven generality, and NetraAI, a dynamical system-based framework engineered for stability and interpretability on small clinical trial datasets. We formalize NetraAI's foundations, combining contraction mappings, information geometry, and evolutionary algorithms to identify predictive patient cohorts. Features are embedded in a metric space and iteratively contracted toward stable attractors that define latent subgroups. A pseudo-temporal embedding and long-range memory enable exploration of higher-order feature interactions, while an internal evolutionary loop selects compact, explainable 2-4-variable bundles ("Personas"). To guide discovery, we introduce an LLM Strategist as a meta-evolutionary layer that observes Persona outputs, prioritizes promising variables, injects domain knowledge, and assesses robustness. This two-tier architecture mirrors the human scientific process: NetraAI as experimentalist, the LLM as theorist, forming a self-improving loop. In case studies (schizophrenia, depression, pancreatic cancer), NetraAI uncovered small, high-effect-size subpopulations that transformed weak baseline models (AUC ~0.50-0.68) into near-perfect classifiers using only a few features. We position NetraAI at the intersection of dynamical systems, information geometry, and evolutionary learning, aligned with emerging concept-level reasoning paradigms such as LeCun's Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA). By prioritizing reliable, explainable knowledge, NetraAI offers a new generation of adaptive, self-reflective AI to accelerate clinical discovery.</p></details> | 27 pages |

But as these same tools move human effort up the development stack, they present fresh dangers: 10% of real prompts leak private data, 42% of generated snippets hide security flaws, and the models can even ``agree'' with wrong ideas, a trait called sycophancy. We argue that firms must tag and review every AI-generated line of code, keep prompts and outputs inside private or on-premises deployments, obey emerging safety regulations, and add tests that catch sycophantic answers -- so they can gain speed without losing security and accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[SemAgent: A Semantics Aware Program Repair Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16650v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in downstream software engineering tasks such as Automated Program Repair (APR). In particular, there has been a lot of research on repository-level issue-resolution benchmarks such as SWE-Bench. Although there has been significant progress on this topic, we notice that in the process of solving such issues, existing agentic systems tend to hyper-localize on immediately suspicious lines of code and fix them in isolation, without a deeper understanding of the issue semantics, code semantics, or execution semantics. Consequently, many existing systems generate patches that overfit to the user issue, even when a more general fix is preferable. To address this limitation, we introduce SemAgent, a novel workflow-based procedure that leverages issue, code, and execution semantics to generate patches that are complete - identifying and fixing all lines relevant to the issue. We achieve this through a novel pipeline that (a) leverages execution semantics to retrieve relevant context, (b) comprehends issue-semantics via generalized abstraction, (c) isolates code-semantics within the context of this abstraction, and (d) leverages this understanding in a two-stage architecture: a repair stage that proposes fine-grained fixes, followed by a reviewer stage that filters relevant fixes based on the inferred issue-semantics. Our evaluations show that our methodology achieves a solve rate of 44.66% on the SWEBench-Lite benchmark beating all other workflow-based approaches, and an absolute improvement of 7.66% compared to our baseline, which lacks such deep semantic understanding. We note that our approach performs particularly well on issues requiring multi-line reasoning (and editing) and edge-case handling, suggesting that incorporating issue and code semantics into APR pipelines can lead to robust and semantically consistent repairs.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches such as HTML boilerplate extraction or keyword filters often fail in multilingual settings and struggle with context-sensitive nuances, whereas Large Language Models (LLMs) offer improved quality at high computational cost. We introduce SORE (Semantic Outlier Removal), a cost-effective, transparent method that leverages multilingual sentence embeddings and approximate nearest-neighbor search to identify and excise unwanted text segments. By first identifying core content via metadata embedding and then flagging segments that either closely match predefined outlier groups or deviate significantly from the core, SORE achieves near-LLM extraction precision at a fraction of the cost. Experiments on HTML datasets demonstrate that SORE outperforms structural methods and yield high precision in diverse scenarios. Our system is currently deployed in production, processing millions of documents daily across multiple languages while maintaining both efficiency and accuracy. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we release our implementation and evaluation datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 63rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2025) Industry Track, 10 pages</p></details> |
| **[Learning to Route LLMs with Confidence Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13284v3)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on several tasks and are increasingly deployed in real-world applications. However, especially in high-stakes settings, it becomes vital to know when the output of an LLM may be unreliable. Depending on whether an answer is trustworthy, a system can then choose to route the question to another expert, or otherwise fall back on a safe default behavior. In this work, we study the extent to which LLMs can reliably indicate confidence in their answers, and how this notion of confidence can translate into downstream accuracy gains. We propose Self-Reflection with Error-based Feedback (Self-REF), a lightweight training strategy to teach LLMs to express confidence in whether their answers are correct in a reliable manner. Self-REF introduces confidence tokens into the LLM, from which a confidence score can be extracted. Compared to conventional approaches such as verbalizing confidence and examining token probabilities, we demonstrate empirically that confidence tokens show significant improvements in downstream routing and rejection learning tasks.</p></details> |  |

While individual requirements can usually be analyzed manually, verifying properties (e.g., satisfiability) over sets of NL requirements is particularly challenging. Formal approaches (e.g., SMT solvers) may efficiently verify such properties, but are known to have theoretical limitations. Additionally, the translation of NL requirements into formal constraints typically requires significant manual effort. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as an alternative approach for formal reasoning tasks, but their effectiveness in verifying requirements over strings is less studied. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid approach that verifies the satisfiability of NL requirements over strings by using LLMs (1) to derive a satisfiability outcome (and a consistent string, if possible), and (2) to generate declarative (i.e., SMT) and imperative (i.e., Python) checkers, used to validate the correctness of (1). In our experiments, we assess the performance of four LLMs. Results show that LLMs effectively translate natural language into checkers, even achieving perfect testing accuracy for Python-based checkers. These checkers substantially help LLMs in generating a consistent string and accurately identifying unsatisfiable requirements, leading to more than doubled generation success rate and F1-score in certain cases compared to baselines without generated checkers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 33rd IEEE International Requirements Engineering 2025 conference</p></details> |
| **[Initial Investigation of LLM-Assisted Development of Rule-Based Clinical NLP System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16628v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite advances in machine learning (ML) and large language models (LLMs), rule-based natural language processing (NLP) systems remain active in clinical settings due to their interpretability and operational efficiency. However, their manual development and maintenance are labor-intensive, particularly in tasks with large linguistic variability. To overcome these limitations, we proposed a novel approach employing LLMs solely during the rule-based systems development phase. We conducted the initial experiments focusing on the first two steps of developing a rule-based NLP pipeline: find relevant snippets from the clinical note; extract informative keywords from the snippets for the rule-based named entity recognition (NER) component. Our experiments demonstrated exceptional recall in identifying clinically relevant text snippets (Deepseek: 0.98, Qwen: 0.99) and 1.0 in extracting key terms for NER. This study sheds light on a promising new direction for NLP development, enabling semi-automated or automated development of rule-based systems with significantly faster, more cost-effective, and transparent execution compared with deep learning model-based solutions.</p></details> |  |

Given the challenges in continual learning with large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become the dominant way to introduce new information. However, its reliance on vector retrieval hinders its ability to mimic the dynamic and interconnected nature of human long-term memory. Recent RAG approaches augment vector embeddings with various structures like knowledge graphs to address some of these gaps, namely sense-making and associativity.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown promise in data imputation, existing methods often rely on broad, unfiltered prompts that compromise accuracy, scalability, and explainability. We introduce LDI (Localized Data Imputation), a novel framework that improves both the accuracy and transparency of LLM-based imputation by selecting a compact, contextually relevant subset of attributes and tuples for each missing value. This localized prompting reduces noise, enables traceability by revealing which data influenced each prediction, and is effective across both hosted LLMs and lightweight local models. Our extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that LDI outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 8% higher accuracy when using hosted LLMs. The gains are more substantial with lightweight local models, reaching nearly 17% and 97% accuracy on some datasets when using 3 and 10 examples, respectively. In addition to higher accuracy, LDI offers improved interpretability and robustness to data inconsistencies, making it well-suited for high-stakes and privacy-sensitive applications.</p></details> |  |

We demonstrate that a specialized computer vision system can be built autonomously from a natural language prompt using Agentic AI methods. This involved extending SimpleMind (SM), an open-source Cognitive AI environment with configurable tools for medical image analysis, with an LLM-based agent, implemented using OpenManus, to automate the planning (tool configuration) for a particular computer vision task. We provide a proof-of-concept demonstration that an agentic system can interpret a computer vision task prompt, plan a corresponding SimpleMind workflow by decomposing the task and configuring appropriate tools. From the user input prompt, "provide sm (SimpleMind) config for lungs, heart, and ribs segmentation for cxr (chest x-ray)"), the agent LLM was able to generate the plan (tool configuration file in YAML format), and execute SM-Learn (training) and SM-Think (inference) scripts autonomously. The computer vision agent automatically configured, trained, and tested itself on 50 chest x-ray images, achieving mean dice scores of 0.96, 0.82, 0.83, for lungs, heart, and ribs, respectively.

However, they also exhibit inherent limitations, such as outdated knowledge and susceptibility to hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm to address these issues, but it also introduces new vulnerabilities. Recent efforts have focused on the security of RAG-based LLMs, yet existing attack methods face three critical challenges: (1) their effectiveness declines sharply when only a limited number of poisoned texts can be injected into the knowledge database, (2) they lack sufficient stealth, as the attacks are often detectable by anomaly detection systems, which compromises their effectiveness, and (3) they rely on heuristic approaches to generate poisoned texts, lacking formal optimization frameworks and theoretic guarantees, which limits their effectiveness and applicability. To address these issues, we propose coordinated Prompt-RAG attack (PR-attack), a novel optimization-driven attack that introduces a small number of poisoned texts into the knowledge database while embedding a backdoor trigger within the prompt. When activated, the trigger causes the LLM to generate pre-designed responses to targeted queries, while maintaining normal behavior in other contexts. This ensures both high effectiveness and stealth. We formulate the attack generation process as a bilevel optimization problem leveraging a principled optimization framework to develop optimal poisoned texts and triggers. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PR-Attack, achieving a high attack success rate even with a limited number of poisoned texts and significantly improved stealth compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

However, numerous methodologies frequently neglect the calibration capabilities of large language models (LLMs), which capitalize on their robust in-context reasoning prowess. This work illustrates that providing LLMs with specific cues substantially improves their calibration efficacy, especially in multi-round calibrations. We present a new SGIC: Self-Guided Iterative Calibration Framework that employs uncertainty scores as a tool. Initially, this framework calculates uncertainty scores to determine both the relevance of each document to the query and the confidence level in the responses produced by the LLMs. Subsequently, it reevaluates these scores iteratively, amalgamating them with prior responses to refine calibration. Furthermore, we introduce an innovative approach for constructing an iterative self-calibration training set, which optimizes LLMs to efficiently harness uncertainty scores for capturing critical information and enhancing response accuracy. Our proposed framework significantly improves performance on both closed-source and open-weight LLMs.</p></details> |  |

We present a novel multimodal document chunking approach that leverages Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to process PDF documents in batches while maintaining semantic coherence and structural integrity. Our method processes documents in configurable page batches with cross-batch context preservation, enabling accurate handling of tables spanning multiple pages, embedded visual elements, and procedural content. We evaluate our approach on a curated dataset of PDF documents with manually crafted queries, demonstrating improvements in chunk quality and downstream RAG performance. Our vision-guided approach achieves better accuracy compared to traditional vanilla RAG systems, with qualitative analysis showing superior preservation of document structure and semantic coherence.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 1 Figure, 1 Table</p></details> |

Legal texts are characterized by a predefined hierarchical structure, an extensive network of references and a continuous evolution through multiple temporal versions. This temporal dynamism poses a significant challenge for standard AI systems, demanding a deterministic representation of the law at any given point in time. To address this, our approach grounds the knowledge graph construction in a formal, FRBRoo-inspired model that distinguishes abstract legal works from their concrete textual expressions. We introduce a multi-layered representation of Temporal Versions (capturing date-specific changes) and Language Versions (capturing linguistic variations). By modeling normative evolution as a precise sequence of these versioned entities, we enable the construction of a knowledge graph that serves as a verifiable "ground truth". This allows Large Language Models to generate responses based on accurate, context-aware, and point-in-time correct legal information, overcoming the risk of temporal inaccuracies. Through a detailed analysis of this formal Graph RAG approach and its application to legal norm datasets, this article aims to advance the field of Artificial Intelligence applied to Law, creating opportunities for more effective and reliable systems in legal research, legislative analysis, and decision support.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version enhances the theoretical underpinnings of the proposed Graph RAG methodology, including the introduction of a formal, FRBRoo-based model for versioning, and enabling multi-language support for both content and metadata</p></details> |

It shows that LLMs struggle to capture the root causes of vulnerabilities during vulnerability detection. To address this challenge, we propose enhancing LLMs with multi-dimensional vulnerability knowledge distilled from historical vulnerabilities and fixes. We design a novel knowledge-level Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework Vul-RAG, which improves LLMs with an accuracy increase of 16% - 24% in identifying vulnerable and patched code. Additionally, vulnerability knowledge generated by Vul-RAG can further (1) serve as high-quality explanations to improve manual detection accuracy (from 60% to 77%), and (2) detect 10 previously-unknown bugs in the recent Linux kernel release with 6 assigned CVEs.</p></details> |  |

While large language models (LLMs) facilitate dynamic pedagogical interactions, hallucinations undermine confidence, trust, and instructional value. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) grounds LLM outputs in curated knowledge but requires a clear semantic link between user input and a knowledge base, which is often weak in student dialogue. We propose log-contextualized RAG (LC-RAG), which enhances RAG retrieval by using environment logs to contextualize collaborative discourse. Our findings show that LC-RAG improves retrieval over a discourse-only baseline and allows our collaborative peer agent, Copa, to deliver relevant, personalized guidance that supports students' critical thinking and epistemic decision-making in a collaborative computational modeling environment, C2STEM.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED25) Workshop on Epistemics and Decision-Making in AI-Supported Education</p></details> |

When a user submits a query, RAG executes a vector search to find relevant documents, which are then used to generate a response. However, ensuring the relevance of retrieved documents with a query would be a big challenge. To address this, a secondary model, known as a relevant grader, can be served to verify its relevance. To reduce computational requirements of a relevant grader, a lightweight small language model is preferred. In this work, we finetuned llama-3.2-1b as a relevant grader and achieved a significant increase in precision from 0.1301 to 0.7750. Its precision is comparable to that of llama-3.1-70b.

While RDF/OWL reasoners enable graph-based reasoning, they are limited to fragments of first-order logic, preventing deeper temporal and semantic analysis. This paper addresses both challenges by developing automatic historical event extraction models using multiple LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Llama 3.2) with three enhancement strategies: pure base generation, knowledge graph enhancement, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). We conducted comprehensive evaluations using historical texts from Thucydides. Our findings reveal that enhancement strategies optimize different performance dimensions rather than providing universal improvements. For coverage and historical breadth, base generation achieves optimal performance with Claude and GPT-4 extracting comprehensive events. However, for precision, RAG enhancement improves coordinate accuracy and metadata completeness. Model architecture fundamentally determines enhancement sensitivity: larger models demonstrate robust baseline performance with incremental RAG improvements, while Llama 3.2 shows extreme variance from competitive performance to complete failure. We then developed an automated translation pipeline converting extracted RDF representations into Coq proof assistant specifications, enabling higher-order reasoning beyond RDF capabilities including multi-step causal verification, temporal arithmetic with BC dates, and formal proofs about historical causation. The Coq formalization validates that RAG-discovered event types represent legitimate domain-specific semantic structures rather than ontological violations.</p></details> |  |

Traditional RAG pipelines often suffer from high latency and limited accuracy over massive, diverse datasets. DoTA-RAG addresses these challenges with a three-stage pipeline: query rewriting, dynamic routing to specialized sub-indexes, and multi-stage retrieval and ranking. We further enhance retrieval by evaluating and selecting a superior embedding model, re-embedding the large FineWeb-10BT corpus. Moreover, we create a diverse Q&A dataset of 500 questions generated via the DataMorgana setup across a broad range of WebOrganizer topics and formats. DoTA-RAG improves the answer correctness score from 0.752 (baseline, using LiveRAG pre-built vector store) to 1.478 while maintaining low latency, and it achieves a 0.929 correctness score on the Live Challenge Day. These results highlight DoTA-RAG's potential for practical deployment in domains requiring fast, reliable access to large and evolving knowledge sources.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIGIR...</summary><p>SIGIR LiveRAG 2025 (oral presentation)</p></details> |

Current approaches to supporting research idea generation often rely on generic large language models (LLMs). While LLMs are effective at aiding comprehension and summarization, they often fall short in guiding users toward practical research ideas due to their limitations. In this study, we present a novel structural framework for research ideation. Our framework, The Budget AI Researcher, uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) chains, vector databases, and topic-guided pairing to recombine concepts from hundreds of machine learning papers. The system ingests papers from nine major AI conferences, which collectively span the vast subfields of machine learning, and organizes them into a hierarchical topic tree. It uses the tree to identify distant topic pairs, generate novel research abstracts, and refine them through iterative self-evaluation against relevant literature and peer reviews, generating and refining abstracts that are both grounded in real-world research and demonstrably interesting. Experiments using LLM-based metrics indicate that our method significantly improves the concreteness of generated research ideas relative to standard prompting approaches. Human evaluations further demonstrate a substantial enhancement in the perceived interestingness of the outputs. By bridging the gap between academic data and creative generation, the Budget AI Researcher offers a practical, free tool for accelerating scientific discovery and lowering the barrier for aspiring researchers. Beyond research ideation, this approach inspires solutions to the broader challenge of generating personalized, context-aware outputs grounded in evolving real-world knowledge.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inten...</summary><p>Intended for AAAI's AI4Research Workshop</p></details> |

Data augmentation can potentially alleviate the data shortage, but augmenting vulnerable code is challenging and requires a generative solution that maintains vulnerability. Previous works have only focused on generating samples that contain single statements or specific types of vulnerabilities. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to solve various code generation and comprehension tasks with inspiring results, especially when fused with retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Therefore, we propose VulScribeR, a novel LLM-based solution that leverages carefully curated prompt templates to augment vulnerable datasets. More specifically, we explore three strategies to augment both single and multi-statement vulnerabilities, with LLMs, namely Mutation, Injection, and Extension. Our extensive evaluation across four vulnerability datasets and DLVD models, using three LLMs, show that our approach beats two SOTA methods Vulgen and VGX, and Random Oversampling (ROS) by 27.48%, 27.93%, and 15.41% in f1-score with 5K generated vulnerable samples on average, and 53.84%, 54.10%, 69.90%, and 40.93% with 15K generated vulnerable samples.

However, RAG also introduces new security risks. Existing research focuses mainly on how poisoning attacks in RAG systems affect model output quality, overlooking their potential to amplify model biases. For example, when querying about domestic violence victims, a compromised RAG system might preferentially retrieve documents depicting women as victims, causing the model to generate outputs that perpetuate gender stereotypes even when the original query is gender neutral. To show the impact of the bias, this paper proposes a Bias Retrieval and Reward Attack (BRRA) framework, which systematically investigates attack pathways that amplify language model biases through a RAG system manipulation. We design an adversarial document generation method based on multi-objective reward functions, employ subspace projection techniques to manipulate retrieval results, and construct a cyclic feedback mechanism for continuous bias amplification. Experiments on multiple mainstream large language models demonstrate that BRRA attacks can significantly enhance model biases in dimensions. In addition, we explore a dual stage defense mechanism to effectively mitigate the impacts of the attack. This study reveals that poisoning attacks in RAG systems directly amplify model output biases and clarifies the relationship between RAG system security and model fairness. This novel potential attack indicates that we need to keep an eye on the fairness issues of the RAG system.</p></details> |  |

In this demo paper, we describe how such RAG pipelines can be formulated in the declarative PyTerrier architecture, and the advantages of doing so. Our PyTerrier-RAG extension for PyTerrier provides easy access to standard RAG datasets and evaluation measures, state-of-the-art LLM readers, and using PyTerrier's unique operator notation, easy-to-build pipelines.

While early RAG systems based on static pipelines have shown effectiveness in well-structured tasks, they struggle in real-world scenarios requiring complex reasoning, dynamic retrieval, and multi-modal integration. To address these challenges, the field has shifted toward Reasoning Agentic RAG, a paradigm that embeds decision-making and adaptive tool use directly into the retrieval process. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of Reasoning Agentic RAG methods, categorizing them into two primary systems: predefined reasoning, which follows fixed modular pipelines to boost reasoning, and agentic reasoning, where the model autonomously orchestrates tool interaction during inference. We analyze representative techniques under both paradigms, covering architectural design, reasoning strategies, and tool coordination. Finally, we discuss key research challenges and propose future directions to advance the flexibility, robustness, and applicability of reasoning agentic RAG systems.

However, existing methods typically rely on a single source, either unstructured text or structured knowledge. Moreover, they lack cognitively inspired mechanisms for activating relevant knowledge. To address these issues, we propose KG-Infused RAG, a framework that integrates KGs into RAG systems to implement spreading activation, a cognitive process that enables concept association and inference. KG-Infused RAG retrieves KG facts, expands the query accordingly, and enhances generation by combining corpus passages with structured facts, enabling interpretable, multi-source retrieval grounded in semantic structure. We further improve KG-Infused RAG via preference learning on sampled key stages in the pipeline. Experiments on five QA benchmarks show that KG-Infused RAG consistently outperforms vanilla RAG (by 3.8% to 13.8%). Additionally, when integrated into Self-RAG, KG-Infused RAG brings further performance gains, demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility as a plug-and-play enhancement module for corpus-based RAG methods.</p></details> |  |

However, in our experience of developing a RAG product, LLMs often struggle with source attribution, aligning with other industry studies reporting citation accuracy rates of only about 74% for popular generative search engines. To address this, we present efficient post-processing algorithms to improve citation accuracy in LLM-generated responses, with minimal impact on latency and cost. Our approaches cross-check generated citations against retrieved articles using methods including keyword + semantic matching, fine tuned model with BERTScore, and a lightweight LLM-based technique. Our experimental results demonstrate a relative improvement of 15.46% in the overall accuracy metrics of our RAG system. This significant enhancement potentially enables a shift from our current larger language model to a relatively smaller model that is approximately 12x more cost-effective and 3x faster in inference time, while maintaining comparable performance. This research contributes to enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of AI-generated content in information retrieval and summarization tasks which is critical to gain customer trust especially in commercial products.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safeguarding Multimodal Knowledge Copyright in the RAG-as-a-Service Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10030v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) evolves into service-oriented platforms (Rag-as-a-Service) with shared knowledge bases, protecting the copyright of contributed data becomes essential. Existing watermarking methods in RAG focus solely on textual knowledge, leaving image knowledge unprotected. In this work, we propose AQUA, the first watermark framework for image knowledge protection in Multimodal RAG systems. AQUA embeds semantic signals into synthetic images using two complementary methods: acronym-based triggers and spatial relationship cues. These techniques ensure watermark signals survive indirect watermark propagation from image retriever to textual generator, being efficient, effective and imperceptible. Experiments across diverse models and datasets show that AQUA enables robust, stealthy, and reliable copyright tracing, filling a key gap in multimodal RAG protection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why Uncertainty Estimation Methods Fall Short in RAG: An Axiomatic Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07459v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are valued for their strong performance across various tasks, but they also produce inaccurate or misleading outputs. Uncertainty Estimation (UE) quantifies the model's confidence and helps users assess response reliability. However, existing UE methods have not been thoroughly examined in scenarios like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), where the input prompt includes non-parametric knowledge. This paper shows that current UE methods cannot reliably assess correctness in the RAG setting. We further propose an axiomatic framework to identify deficiencies in existing methods and guide the development of improved approaches. Our framework introduces five constraints that an effective UE method should meet after incorporating retrieved documents into the LLM's prompt. Experimental results reveal that no existing UE method fully satisfies all the axioms, explaining their suboptimal performance in RAG. We further introduce a simple yet effective calibration function based on our framework, which not only satisfies more axioms than baseline methods but also improves the correlation between uncertainty estimates and correctness.</p></details> |  |
| **[ScIRGen: Synthesize Realistic and Large-Scale RAG Dataset for Scientific Research](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11117v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific researchers need intensive information about datasets to effectively evaluate and develop theories and methodologies. The information needs regarding datasets are implicitly embedded in particular research tasks, rather than explicitly expressed in search queries. However, existing scientific retrieval and question-answering (QA) datasets typically address straightforward questions, which do not align with the distribution of real-world research inquiries. To bridge this gap, we developed ScIRGen, a dataset generation framework for scientific QA \& retrieval that more accurately reflects the information needs of professional science researchers, and uses it to create a large-scale scientific retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) dataset with realistic queries, datasets and papers. Technically, we designed a dataset-oriented information extraction method that leverages academic papers to augment the dataset representation. We then proposed a question generation framework by employing cognitive taxonomy to ensure the quality of synthesized questions. We also design a method to automatically filter synthetic answers based on the perplexity shift of LLMs, which is highly aligned with human judgment of answers' validity. Collectively, these methodologies culminated in the creation of the 61k QA dataset, ScIRGen-Geo. We benchmarked representative methods on the ScIRGen-Geo dataset for their question-answering and retrieval capabilities, finding out that current methods still suffer from reasoning from complex questions. This work advances the development of more sophisticated tools to support the intricate information needs of the scientific community.</p></details> | KDD 2025 Accepted |
| **[GaRAGe: A Benchmark with Grounding Annotations for RAG Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07671v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present GaRAGe, a large RAG benchmark with human-curated long-form answers and annotations of each grounding passage, allowing a fine-grained evaluation of whether LLMs can identify relevant grounding when generating RAG answers. Our benchmark contains 2366 questions of diverse complexity, dynamism, and topics, and includes over 35K annotated passages retrieved from both private document sets and the Web, to reflect real-world RAG use cases. This makes it an ideal test bed to evaluate an LLM's ability to identify only the relevant information necessary to compose a response, or provide a deflective response when there is insufficient information. Evaluations of multiple state-of-the-art LLMs on GaRAGe show that the models tend to over-summarise rather than (a) ground their answers strictly on the annotated relevant passages (reaching at most a Relevance-Aware Factuality Score of 60%), or (b) deflect when no relevant grounding is available (reaching at most 31% true positive rate in deflections). The F1 in attribution to relevant sources is at most 58.9%, and we show that performance is particularly reduced when answering time-sensitive questions and when having to draw knowledge from sparser private grounding sources.</p></details> | ACL 2025 (Findings) |

However, existing RAG approaches predominantly rely on flat, similarity-based retrieval that fails to leverage the rich relational structure inherent in user-item interactions. We introduce LlamaRec-LKG-RAG, a novel single-pass, end-to-end trainable framework that integrates personalized knowledge graph context into LLM-based recommendation ranking. Our approach extends the LlamaRec architecture by incorporating a lightweight user preference module that dynamically identifies salient relation paths within a heterogeneous knowledge graph constructed from user behavior and item metadata. These personalized subgraphs are seamlessly integrated into prompts for a fine-tuned Llama-2 model, enabling efficient and interpretable recommendations through a unified inference step. Comprehensive experiments on ML-100K and Amazon Beauty datasets demonstrate consistent and significant improvements over LlamaRec across key ranking metrics (MRR, NDCG, Recall). LlamaRec-LKG-RAG demonstrates the critical value of structured reasoning in LLM-based recommendations and establishes a foundation for scalable, knowledge-aware personalization in next-generation recommender systems.

| **[MrM: Black-Box Membership Inference Attacks against Multimodal RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07399v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems enhance large vision-language models by integrating cross-modal knowledge, enabling their increasing adoption across real-world multimodal tasks. These knowledge databases may contain sensitive information that requires privacy protection. However, multimodal RAG systems inherently grant external users indirect access to such data, making them potentially vulnerable to privacy attacks, particularly membership inference attacks (MIAs). % Existing MIA methods targeting RAG systems predominantly focus on the textual modality, while the visual modality remains relatively underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose MrM, the first black-box MIA framework targeted at multimodal RAG systems. It utilizes a multi-object data perturbation framework constrained by counterfactual attacks, which can concurrently induce the RAG systems to retrieve the target data and generate information that leaks the membership information. Our method first employs an object-aware data perturbation method to constrain the perturbation to key semantics and ensure successful retrieval. Building on this, we design a counterfact-informed mask selection strategy to prioritize the most informative masked regions, aiming to eliminate the interference of model self-knowledge and amplify attack efficacy. Finally, we perform statistical membership inference by modeling query trials to extract features that reflect the reconstruction of masked semantics from response patterns. Experiments on two visual datasets and eight mainstream commercial visual-language models (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2) demonstrate that MrM achieves consistently strong performance across both sample-level and set-level evaluations, and remains robust under adaptive defenses.</p></details> |  |
| **[BRIGHT+: Upgrading the BRIGHT Benchmark with MARCUS, a Multi-Agent RAG Clean-Up Suite](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07116v1)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems require corpora that are both structurally clean and semantically coherent. BRIGHT is a recent and influential benchmark designed to evaluate complex multi-hop retrieval across diverse, high-reasoning domains. However, its practical effectiveness is limited by common web-crawled artifacts - such as content redundancy and semantic discontinuity - that impair retrieval accuracy and downstream reasoning. Notably, we find that such issues are concentrated in seven StackExchange-derived subdomains, while other domains (e.g., Coding and Theorem-based content) remain relatively clean. In this study, we present MARCUS, a multi-agent pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to systematically clean and re-chunk BRIGHT into a higher-quality corpus: BRIGHT-Plus. MARCUS applies dedicated agents for structural noise removal and semantic segmentation, preserving answer-bearing spans while improving contextual integrity. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that BRIGHT-Plus yields consistent and significant improvements in both retrieval accuracy and multi-hop reasoning across a diverse set of retrievers. We release both the BRIGHT-Plus corpus and the MARCUS pipeline to support future research on robust, reasoning-centric retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables.

| **[Graph-based RAG Enhancement via Global Query Disambiguation and Dependency-Aware Reranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11106v1)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contemporary graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods typically begin by extracting entities from user queries and then leverage pre-constructed knowledge graphs to retrieve related relationships and metadata. However, this pipeline's exclusive reliance on entity-level extraction can lead to the misinterpretation or omission of latent yet critical information and relations. As a result, retrieved content may be irrelevant or contradictory, and essential knowledge may be excluded, exacerbating hallucination risks and degrading the fidelity of generated responses. To address these limitations, we introduce PankRAG, a framework that combines a globally aware, hierarchical query-resolution strategy with a novel dependency-aware reranking mechanism. PankRAG first constructs a multi-level resolution path that captures both parallel and sequential interdependencies within a query, guiding large language models (LLMs) through structured reasoning. It then applies its dependency-aware reranker to exploit the dependency structure among resolved sub-questions, enriching and validating retrieval results for subsequent sub-questions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that PankRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across multiple benchmarks, underscoring its robustness and generalizability.</p></details> |  |
| **[E^2GraphRAG: Streamlining Graph-based RAG for High Efficiency and Effectiveness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24226v4)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based RAG methods like GraphRAG have shown promising global understanding of the knowledge base by constructing hierarchical entity graphs. However, they often suffer from inefficiency and rely on manually pre-defined query modes, limiting practical use. In this paper, we propose E^2GraphRAG, a streamlined graph-based RAG framework that improves both Efficiency and Effectiveness. During the indexing stage, E^2GraphRAG constructs a summary tree with large language models and an entity graph with SpaCy based on document chunks. We then construct bidirectional indexes between entities and chunks to capture their many-to-many relationships, enabling fast lookup during both local and global retrieval. For the retrieval stage, we design an adaptive retrieval strategy that leverages the graph structure to retrieve and select between local and global modes. Experiments show that E^2GraphRAG achieves up to 10 times faster indexing than GraphRAG and 100 times speedup over LightRAG in retrieval while maintaining competitive QA performance.</p></details> | 16 pages |

Many existing educational solutions rely on cloud-based infrastructure or proprietary tools, which are costly and may raise privacy concerns. Regulated industries with limited budgets require affordable, self-hosted solutions. We introduce an end-to-end, open-source framework leveraging small (3B-7B parameters), locally deployed LLMs for customized teaching material generation and assessment. Our system uniquely incorporates an interactive loop crucial for effective small-model refinement, and an auxiliary LLM verifier to mitigate jailbreaking risks, enhancing output reliability and safety. Utilizing Retrieval and Context Augmented Generation (RAG/CAG), it produces factually accurate, customized pedagogically-styled content. Deployed on-premises for data privacy and validated through an evaluation pipeline and a college physics pilot, our findings show that carefully engineered small LLM systems can offer robust, affordable, practical, and safe educator support, achieving utility comparable to larger models for targeted tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[ECoRAG: Evidentiality-guided Compression for Long Context RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05167v2)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in Open-Domain Question Answering (ODQA) by leveraging external documents through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To reduce RAG overhead, from longer context, context compression is necessary. However, prior compression methods do not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, which limit the performance in LLM-based RAG. We thus propose Evidentiality-guided RAG, or ECoRAG framework. ECoRAG improves LLM performance by compressing retrieved documents based on evidentiality, ensuring whether answer generation is supported by the correct evidence. As an additional step, ECoRAG reflects whether the compressed content provides sufficient evidence, and if not, retrieves more until sufficient. Experiments show that ECoRAG improves LLM performance on ODQA tasks, outperforming existing compression methods. Furthermore, ECoRAG is highly cost-efficient, as it not only reduces latency but also minimizes token usage by retaining only the necessary information to generate the correct answer. Code is available at https://github.com/ldilab/ECoRAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAGE: A Framework of Precise Retrieval for RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01713v3)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated significant proficiency in conducting question-answering (QA) tasks within a specified corpus. Nonetheless, numerous failure instances of RAG in QA still exist. These failures are not solely attributable to the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs); instead, they predominantly arise from the retrieval of inaccurate information for LLMs due to two limitations: (1) Current RAG methods segment the corpus without considering semantics, making it difficult to find relevant context due to impaired correlation between questions and the segments. (2) There is a trade-off between missing essential context with fewer context retrieved and getting irrelevant context with more context retrieved. In this paper, we introduce a RAG framework (SAGE), to overcome these limitations. First, to address the segmentation issue without considering semantics, we propose to train a semantic segmentation model. This model is trained to segment the corpus into semantically complete chunks. Second, to ensure that only the most relevant chunks are retrieved while the irrelevant ones are ignored, we design a chunk selection algorithm to dynamically select chunks based on the decreasing speed of the relevance score, leading to a more relevant selection. Third, to further ensure the precision of the retrieved chunks, we propose letting LLMs assess whether retrieved chunks are excessive or lacking and then adjust the amount of context accordingly. Experiments show that SAGE outperforms baselines by 61.25% in the quality of QA on average. Moreover, by avoiding retrieving noisy context, SAGE lowers the cost of the tokens consumed in LLM inference and achieves a 49.41% enhancement in cost efficiency on average. Additionally, our work offers valuable insights for boosting RAG.</p></details> |  |

Within financial sectors, modern enterprises increasingly rely on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to address complex compliance requirements in financial document workflows. However, existing solutions struggle to account for the inherent heterogeneity of data (e.g., text, tables, diagrams) and evolving nature of regulatory standards used in financial filings, leading to compromised accuracy in critical information extraction. We propose the FinSage framework as a solution, utilizing a multi-aspect RAG framework tailored for regulatory compliance analysis in multi-modal financial documents. FinSage introduces three innovative components: (1) a multi-modal pre-processing pipeline that unifies diverse data formats and generates chunk-level metadata summaries, (2) a multi-path sparse-dense retrieval system augmented with query expansion (HyDE) and metadata-aware semantic search, and (3) a domain-specialized re-ranking module fine-tuned via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to prioritize compliance-critical content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FinSage achieves an impressive recall of 92.51% on 75 expert-curated questions derived from surpasses the best baseline method on the FinanceBench question answering datasets by 24.06% in accuracy. Moreover, FinSage has been successfully deployed as financial question-answering agent in online meetings, where it has already served more than 1,200 people.</p></details> |  |

It leverages graphs to model the hierarchical structure between specific concepts, enabling more coherent and effective knowledge retrieval for accurate reasoning.Despite its conceptual promise, recent studies report that GraphRAG frequently underperforms vanilla RAG on many real-world tasks. This raises a critical question: Is GraphRAG really effective, and in which scenarios do graph structures provide measurable benefits for RAG systems? To address this, we propose GraphRAG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate GraphRAG models onboth hierarchical knowledge retrieval and deep contextual reasoning. GraphRAG-Bench features a comprehensive dataset with tasks of increasing difficulty, coveringfact retrieval, complex reasoning, contextual summarization, and creative generation, and a systematic evaluation across the entire pipeline, from graph constructionand knowledge retrieval to final generation. Leveraging this novel benchmark, we systematically investigate the conditions when GraphRAG surpasses traditional RAG and the underlying reasons for its success, offering guidelines for its practical application. All related resources and analyses are collected for the community at https://github.com/GraphRAG-Bench/GraphRAG-Benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Head RAG: Solving Multi-Aspect Problems with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05085v3)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling the retrieval of documents into the LLM context to provide more accurate and relevant responses. Existing RAG solutions do not focus on queries that may require fetching multiple documents with substantially different contents. Such queries occur frequently, but are challenging because the embeddings of these documents may be distant in the embedding space, making it hard to retrieve them all. This paper introduces Multi-Head RAG (MRAG), a novel scheme designed to address this gap with a simple yet powerful idea: leveraging activations of Transformer's multi-head attention layer, instead of the decoder layer, as keys for fetching multi-aspect documents. The driving observation is that different attention heads learn to capture different data aspects. Harnessing the corresponding activations results in embeddings that represent various facets of data items and queries, improving the retrieval accuracy for complex queries. We provide an evaluation methodology and metrics, multi-aspect datasets, and real-world use cases to demonstrate MRAG's effectiveness. We show MRAG's design advantages over 18 RAG baselines, empirical improvements of up to 20% in retrieval success ratios, and benefits for downstream LLM generation. MRAG can be seamlessly integrated with existing RAG frameworks and benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

While traditional flight control relies on hardcoded equations, recent Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential for more flexible problem-solving but struggle with reliably selecting and applying correct mathematical formulations and executing precise multi-step arithmetic. We propose RAG-UAV, a retrieval-augmented generation framework designed to improve the mathematical reasoning of several LLMs (including GPT o1/Turbo, Llama-3.2/3.3, Mistral, and DeepSeek R1) in UAV-specific contexts by providing access to relevant domain literature. To conduct an initial assessment, we introduce the UAV-Math-Bench, a small problem set comprising 20 UAV-centric mathematical problems across four difficulty levels. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating retrieval substantially increases exact answer accuracy (achieving up to 75% with o1), reduces instances of incorrect formulation selection (from 25% without RAG to 5% with RAG), decreases numerical errors, reducing Mean Squared Error (MSE) by orders of magnitude for the best-performing models. This pilot study indicates that RAG can enable general-purpose LLMs to function as more reliable tools for engineering analysis, although direct real-time flight control requires further investigation and validation on a larger scale. All benchmark data, question and answer are publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures, 4 appendix subsections</p></details> |

However, RAG systems are highly sensitive to retrieval noise prevalent in real-world scenarios. Existing benchmarks fail to emulate the complex and heterogeneous noise distributions encountered in real-world retrieval environments, undermining reliable robustness assessment. In this paper, we define four categories of retrieval noise based on linguistic properties and noise characteristics, aiming to reflect the heterogeneity of noise in real-world scenarios. Building on this, we introduce Magic Mushroom, a benchmark for replicating "magic mushroom" noise: contexts that appear relevant on the surface but covertly mislead RAG systems. Magic Mushroom comprises 7,468 single-hop and 3,925 multi-hop question-answer pairs. More importantly, Magic Mushroom enables researchers to flexibly configure combinations of retrieval noise according to specific research objectives or application scenarios, allowing for highly controlled evaluation setups. We evaluate LLM generators of varying parameter scales and classic RAG denoising strategies under diverse noise distributions to investigate their performance dynamics during progressive noise encroachment. Our analysis reveals that both generators and denoising strategies have significant room for improvement and exhibit extreme sensitivity to noise distributions. Magic Mushroom emerges as a promising tool for evaluating and advancing noise-robust RAG systems, accelerating their widespread deployment in real-world applications.

Semantic variability across domains like medicine, networking, or law hampers RAG's context precision, while fine-tuning solutions are costly, slow, and lack generalization as new data emerges. Achieving zero-shot precision with retrievers without fine-tuning still remains a key challenge. We introduce 'MetaGen Blended RAG', a novel enterprise search approach that enhances semantic retrievers through a metadata generation pipeline and hybrid query indexes using dense and sparse vectors. By leveraging key concepts, topics, and acronyms, our method creates metadata-enriched semantic indexes and boosted hybrid queries, delivering robust, scalable performance without fine-tuning. On the biomedical PubMedQA dataset, MetaGen Blended RAG achieves 82% retrieval accuracy and 77% RAG accuracy, surpassing all prior zero-shot RAG benchmarks and even rivaling fine-tuned models on that dataset, while also excelling on datasets like SQuAD and NQ. This approach redefines enterprise search using a new approach to building semantic retrievers with unmatched generalization across specialized domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

We show that existing attacks are not designed to be stealthy, allowing reliable detection and mitigation. We formalize stealth using a distinguishability-based security game. If a few poisoned passages are designed to control the response, they must differentiate themselves from benign ones, inherently compromising stealth. This motivates the need for attackers to rigorously analyze intermediate signals involved in generation$\unicode{x2014}$such as attention patterns or next-token probability distributions$\unicode{x2014}$to avoid easily detectable traces of manipulation. Leveraging attention patterns, we propose a passage-level score$\unicode{x2014}$the Normalized Passage Attention Score$\unicode{x2014}$used by our Attention-Variance Filter algorithm to identify and filter potentially poisoned passages. This method mitigates existing attacks, improving accuracy by up to $\sim 20 \%$ over baseline defenses. To probe the limits of attention-based defenses, we craft stealthier adaptive attacks that obscure such traces, achieving up to $35 \%$ attack success rate, and highlight the challenges in improving stealth.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we propose Cross-source knowledge \textbf{Re}conciliation for Multimodal RAG (CoRe-MMRAG), a novel end-to-end framework that effectively reconciles inconsistencies across knowledge sources. CoRe-MMRAG follows a four-stage pipeline: it first generates an internal response from parametric knowledge, then selects the most relevant multimodal evidence via joint similarity assessment, generates an external response, and finally integrates both to produce a reliable answer. Additionally, a specialized training paradigm enhances knowledge source discrimination, multimodal integration, and unified answer generation. Experiments on KB-VQA benchmarks show that CoRe-MMRAG achieves substantial improvements over baseline methods, achieving 5.6% and 9.3% performance gains on InfoSeek and Encyclopedic-VQA, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 Main</p></details> |

| **[IndicRAGSuite: Large-Scale Datasets and a Benchmark for Indian Language RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01615v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enable language models to access relevant information and generate accurate, well-grounded, and contextually informed responses. However, for Indian languages, the development of high-quality RAG systems is hindered by the lack of two critical resources: (1) evaluation benchmarks for retrieval and generation tasks, and (2) large-scale training datasets for multilingual retrieval. Most existing benchmarks and datasets are centered around English or high-resource languages, making it difficult to extend RAG capabilities to the diverse linguistic landscape of India. To address the lack of evaluation benchmarks, we create IndicMSMarco, a multilingual benchmark for evaluating retrieval quality and response generation in 13 Indian languages, created via manual translation of 1000 diverse queries from MS MARCO-dev set. To address the need for training data, we build a large-scale dataset of (question, answer, relevant passage) tuples derived from the Wikipedias of 19 Indian languages using state-of-the-art LLMs. Additionally, we include translated versions of the original MS MARCO dataset to further enrich the training data and ensure alignment with real-world information-seeking tasks.

| **[KET-RAG: A Cost-Efficient Multi-Granular Indexing Framework for Graph-RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09304v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-RAG constructs a knowledge graph from text chunks to improve retrieval in Large Language Model (LLM)-based question answering. It is particularly useful in domains such as biomedicine, law, and political science, where retrieval often requires multi-hop reasoning over proprietary documents. Some existing Graph-RAG systems construct KNN graphs based on text chunk relevance, but this coarse-grained approach fails to capture entity relationships within texts, leading to sub-par retrieval and generation quality. To address this, recent solutions leverage LLMs to extract entities and relationships from text chunks, constructing triplet-based knowledge graphs. However, this approach incurs significant indexing costs, especially for large document collections. To ensure a good result accuracy while reducing the indexing cost, we propose KET-RAG, a multi-granular indexing framework. KET-RAG first identifies a small set of key text chunks and leverages an LLM to construct a knowledge graph skeleton. It then builds a text-keyword bipartite graph from all text chunks, serving as a lightweight alternative to a full knowledge graph. During retrieval, KET-RAG searches both structures: it follows the local search strategy of existing Graph-RAG systems on the skeleton while mimicking this search on the bipartite graph to improve retrieval quality. We evaluate 13 solutions on three real-world datasets, demonstrating that KET-RAG outperforms all competitors in indexing cost, retrieval effectiveness, and generation quality. Notably, it achieves comparable or superior retrieval quality to Microsoft's Graph-RAG while reducing indexing costs by over an order of magnitude. Additionally, it improves the generation quality by up to 32.4% while lowering indexing costs by around 20%.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAG4ITOps: A Supervised Fine-Tunable and Comprehensive RAG Framework for IT Operations and Maintenance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15805v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the ever-increasing demands on Question Answering (QA) systems for IT operations and maintenance, an efficient and supervised fine-tunable framework is necessary to ensure the data security, private deployment and continuous upgrading. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have notably improved the open-domain QA's performance, how to efficiently handle enterprise-exclusive corpora and build domain-specific QA systems are still less-studied for industrial applications. In this paper, we propose a general and comprehensive framework based on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and facilitate the whole business process of establishing QA systems for IT operations and maintenance. In accordance with the prevailing RAG method, our proposed framework, named with RAG4ITOps, composes of two major stages: (1) Models Fine-tuning \& Data Vectorization, and (2) Online QA System Process. At the Stage 1, we leverage a contrastive learning method with two negative sampling strategies to fine-tune the embedding model, and design the instruction templates to fine-tune the LLM with a Retrieval Augmented Fine-Tuning method. At the Stage 2, an efficient process of QA system is built for serving. We collect enterprise-exclusive corpora from the domain of cloud computing, and the extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior results than counterparts on two kinds of QA tasks. Our experiment also provide a case for applying the RAG4ITOps to real-world enterprise-level applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2024 Industry Track</p></details> |

We demonstrate that enhancing generative models' capacity to process noisy content is equally critical for robust performance. In this paper, we present KARE-RAG (Knowledge-Aware Refinement and Enhancement for RAG), which improves knowledge utilization through three key innovations: (1) structured knowledge representations that facilitate error detection during training, (2) Dense Direct Preference Optimization (DDPO)-a refined training objective that prioritizes correction of critical errors, and (3) a contrastive data generation pipeline that maintains semantic consistency while rectifying factual inaccuracies. Experiments show our method significantly enhances standard RAG pipelines across model scales, improving both in-domain and out-of-domain task performance without compromising general capabilities. Notably, these gains are achieved with modest training data, suggesting data-efficient optimization is possible through targeted learning strategies. Our findings establish a new direction for RAG improvement: by improving how models learn to process retrieved content, we can enhance performance across diverse inference paradigms. All data and code will be publicly available on Github.</p></details> |  |

Traditional text-based methods cannot handle visual-related information. On the other hand, current vision-based RAG approaches are often limited by fixed pipelines and frequently struggle to reason effectively due to the insufficient activation of the fundamental capabilities of models. As RL has been proven to be beneficial for model reasoning, we introduce VRAG-RL, a novel RL framework tailored for complex reasoning across visually rich information. With this framework, VLMs interact with search engines, autonomously sampling single-turn or multi-turn reasoning trajectories with the help of visual perception tokens and undergoing continual optimization based on these samples. Our approach highlights key limitations of RL in RAG domains: (i) Prior Multi-modal RAG approaches tend to merely incorporate images into the context, leading to insufficient reasoning token allocation and neglecting visual-specific perception; and (ii) When models interact with search engines, their queries often fail to retrieve relevant information due to the inability to articulate requirements, thereby leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we define an action space tailored for visually rich inputs, with actions including cropping and scaling, allowing the model to gather information from a coarse-to-fine perspective. Furthermore, to bridge the gap between users' original inquiries and the retriever, we employ a simple yet effective reward that integrates query rewriting and retrieval performance with a model-based reward. Our VRAG-RL optimizes VLMs for RAG tasks using specially designed RL strategies, aligning the model with real-world applications. The code is available at https://github.com/Alibaba-NLP/VRAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ranking Free RAG: Replacing Re-ranking with Selection in RAG for Sensitive Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16014v3)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines rely on similarity-based retrieval and re-ranking, which depend on heuristics such as top-k, and lack explainability, interpretability, and robustness against adversarial content. To address this gap, we propose a novel method METEORA that replaces re-ranking in RAG with a rationale-driven selection approach. METEORA operates in two stages. First, a general-purpose LLM is preference-tuned to generate rationales conditioned on the input query using direct preference optimization. These rationales guide the evidence chunk selection engine, which selects relevant chunks in three stages: pairing individual rationales with corresponding retrieved chunks for local relevance, global selection with elbow detection for adaptive cutoff, and context expansion via neighboring chunks. This process eliminates the need for top-k heuristics. The rationales are also used for consistency check using a Verifier LLM to detect and filter poisoned or misleading content for safe generation. The framework provides explainable and interpretable evidence flow by using rationales consistently across both selection and verification. Our evaluation across six datasets spanning legal, financial, and academic research domains shows that METEORA improves generation accuracy by 33.34% while using approximately 50% fewer chunks than state-of-the-art re-ranking methods. In adversarial settings, METEORA significantly improves the F1 score from 0.10 to 0.44 over the state-of-the-art perplexity-based defense baseline, demonstrating strong resilience to poisoning attacks.

However, large-scale RAG systems consume significant computational resources and are prone to generating hallucinated content from Humans. In this work, we introduce $\texttt{DRAG}$, a novel framework for distilling RAG knowledge from large-scale Language Models (LLMs) into small LMs (SLMs). Our approach leverages evidence- and knowledge graph-based distillation, ensuring that the distilled model retains critical factual knowledge while significantly reducing model size and computational cost. By aligning the smaller model's predictions with a structured knowledge graph and ranked evidence, $\texttt{DRAG}$ effectively mitigates hallucinations and improves factual accuracy. We further present a case demonstrating how our framework mitigates user privacy risks and introduce a corresponding benchmark. Experimental evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the prior competitive RAG methods like MiniRAG for SLMs by up to 27.7% using the same models, preserving high-level efficiency and reliability. With $\texttt{DRAG}$, we provide a practical and resource-efficient roadmap to deploying enhanced retrieval and generation capabilities in small-sized LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 Main.

However, discrepancies between these textbooks and the parametric knowledge inherent in Large Language Models (LLMs) can undermine the effectiveness of RAG systems. To systematically investigate RAG system robustness against such knowledge discrepancies, we introduce KnowShiftQA. This novel question answering dataset simulates these discrepancies by applying deliberate hypothetical knowledge updates to both answers and source documents, reflecting how textbook knowledge can shift. KnowShiftQA comprises 3,005 questions across five subjects, designed with a comprehensive question typology focusing on context utilization and knowledge integration. Our extensive experiments on retrieval and question answering performance reveal that most RAG systems suffer a substantial performance drop when faced with these knowledge discrepancies. Furthermore, questions requiring the integration of contextual (textbook) knowledge with parametric (LLM) knowledge pose a significant challenge to current LLMs.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Main |

A key challenge is designing AI methods that can incrementally extract, structure, and validate information while preserving hierarchical and contextual relationships. We introduce CDMizer, a template-driven, LLM, and RAG-based framework for structured text transformation. By leveraging depth-based retrieval and hierarchical generation, CDMizer ensures a controlled, modular process that aligns generated outputs with predefined schema. Its template-driven approach guarantees syntactic correctness, schema adherence, and improved scalability, addressing key limitations of direct generation methods. Additionally, we propose an LLM-powered evaluation framework to assess the completeness and accuracy of structured representations. Demonstrated in the transformation of Over-the-Counter (OTC) financial derivative contracts into the Common Domain Model (CDM), CDMizer establishes a scalable foundation for AI-driven document understanding, structured synthesis, and automated validation in broader contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

This paper presents an automated platform designed to streamline key aspects of LEED certification. The platform integrates a PySide6-based user interface, a review Manager for process orchestration, and multiple analysis engines for credit compliance, energy modeling via EnergyPlus, and location-based evaluation. Key components include an OpenCV-based preprocessing pipeline for document analysis and a report generation module powered by the Gemma3 large language model with a retrieval-augmented generation framework. Implementation techniques - including computer vision for document analysis, structured LLM prompt design, and RAG-based report generation - are detailed. Initial results from pilot project deployment show improvements in efficiency and accuracy compared to traditional manual workflows, achieving 82% automation coverage and up to 70% reduction in documentation time.

| **[Investigating Language Preference of Multilingual RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11175v4)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) systems enhance language models by integrating external multilingual information to produce context-aware responses. However, mRAG systems struggle with retrieving relevant information due to linguistic variations between queries and documents, generating inconsistent responses when multilingual sources conflict. In this work, we systematically investigate language preferences in both retrieval and generation of mRAG through a series of experiments. Our analysis indicates that retrievers tend to prefer high-resource and query languages, yet this preference does not consistently improve generation performance. Moreover, we observe that generators prefer the query language or Latin scripts, leading to inconsistent outputs. To overcome these issues, we propose Dual Knowledge Multilingual RAG (DKM-RAG), a simple yet effective framework that fuses translated multilingual passages with complementary model knowledge. Empirical results demonstrate that DKM-RAG mitigates language preference in generation and enhances performance across diverse linguistic settings.

While several studies have investigated RAG pipelines for high-resource languages, the optimization of RAG components for Arabic remains underexplored. This study presents a comprehensive empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art RAG components-including chunking strategies, embedding models, rerankers, and language models-across a diverse set of Arabic datasets. Using the RAGAS framework, we systematically compare performance across four core metrics: context precision, context recall, answer faithfulness, and answer relevancy. Our experiments demonstrate that sentence-aware chunking outperforms all other segmentation methods, while BGE-M3 and Multilingual-E5-large emerge as the most effective embedding models. The inclusion of a reranker (bge-reranker-v2-m3) significantly boosts faithfulness in complex datasets, and Aya-8B surpasses StableLM in generation quality. These findings provide critical insights for building high-quality Arabic RAG pipelines and offer practical guidelines for selecting optimal components across different document types.</p></details> |  |
| **[ORAN-GUIDE: RAG-Driven Prompt Learning for LLM-Augmented Reinforcement Learning in O-RAN Network Slicing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00576v1)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced wireless networks must support highly dynamic and heterogeneous service demands. Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture enables this flexibility by adopting modular, disaggregated components, such as the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC), Centralized Unit (CU), and Distributed Unit (DU), that can support intelligent control via machine learning (ML). While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a powerful tool for managing dynamic resource allocation and slicing, it often struggles to process raw, unstructured input like RF features, QoS metrics, and traffic trends. These limitations hinder policy generalization and decision efficiency in partially observable and evolving environments. To address this, we propose \textit{ORAN-GUIDE}, a dual-LLM framework that enhances multi-agent RL (MARL) with task-relevant, semantically enriched state representations. The architecture employs a domain-specific language model, ORANSight, pretrained on O-RAN control and configuration data, to generate structured, context-aware prompts. These prompts are fused with learnable tokens and passed to a frozen GPT-based encoder that outputs high-level semantic representations for DRL agents. This design adopts a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) style pipeline tailored for technical decision-making in wireless systems. Experimental results show that ORAN-GUIDE improves sample efficiency, policy convergence, and performance generalization over standard MARL and single-LLM baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pandora's Box or Aladdin's Lamp: A Comprehensive Analysis Revealing the Role of RAG Noise in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13533v4)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a crucial method for addressing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). While recent research has extended RAG models to complex noisy scenarios, these explorations often confine themselves to limited noise types and presuppose that noise is inherently detrimental to LLMs, potentially deviating from real-world retrieval environments and restricting practical applicability. In this paper, we define seven distinct noise types from a linguistic perspective and establish a Noise RAG Benchmark (NoiserBench), a comprehensive evaluation framework encompassing multiple datasets and reasoning tasks. Through empirical evaluation of eight representative LLMs with diverse architectures and scales, we reveal that these noises can be further categorized into two practical groups: noise that is beneficial to LLMs (aka beneficial noise) and noise that is harmful to LLMs (aka harmful noise). While harmful noise generally impairs performance, beneficial noise may enhance several aspects of model capabilities and overall performance. Our analysis offers insights for developing more robust, adaptable RAG solutions and mitigating hallucinations across diverse retrieval scenarios.

| **[Astute RAG: Overcoming Imperfect Retrieval Augmentation and Knowledge Conflicts for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07176v2)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval augmented generation (RAG), while effectively integrating external knowledge to address the inherent limitations of large language models (LLMs), can be hindered by imperfect retrieval that contain irrelevant, misleading, or even malicious information. Previous studies have rarely connected the behavior of RAG through joint analysis, particularly regarding error propagation coming from imperfect retrieval and potential conflicts between LLMs' internal knowledge and external sources. Through comprehensive and controlled analyses under realistic conditions, we find that imperfect retrieval augmentation is inevitable, common, and harmful. We identify the knowledge conflicts between LLM-internal and external knowledge from retrieval as a bottleneck to overcome imperfect retrieval in the post-retrieval stage of RAG. To address this, we propose Astute RAG, a novel RAG approach designed to be resilient to imperfect retrieval augmentation. It adaptively elicits essential information from LLMs' internal knowledge, iteratively consolidates internal and external knowledge with source-awareness, and finalizes the answer according to information reliability. Our experiments with Gemini and Claude demonstrate the superior performance of Astute RAG compared to previous robustness-enhanced RAG approaches. Specifically, Astute RAG is the only RAG method that achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing conventional use of LLMs under the worst-case scenario. Further analysis reveals the effectiveness of Astute RAG in resolving knowledge conflicts, thereby improving the trustworthiness of RAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 main conference</p></details> |
| **[ComposeRAG: A Modular and Composable RAG for Corpus-Grounded Multi-Hop Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00232v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are increasingly diverse, yet many suffer from monolithic designs that tightly couple core functions like query reformulation, retrieval, reasoning, and verification. This limits their interpretability, systematic evaluation, and targeted improvement, especially for complex multi-hop question answering. We introduce ComposeRAG, a novel modular abstraction that decomposes RAG pipelines into atomic, composable modules. Each module, such as Question Decomposition, Query Rewriting, Retrieval Decision, and Answer Verification, acts as a parameterized transformation on structured inputs/outputs, allowing independent implementation, upgrade, and analysis. To enhance robustness against errors in multi-step reasoning, ComposeRAG incorporates a self-reflection mechanism that iteratively revisits and refines earlier steps upon verification failure. Evaluated on four challenging multi-hop QA benchmarks, ComposeRAG consistently outperforms strong baselines in both accuracy and grounding fidelity. Specifically, it achieves up to a 15% accuracy improvement over fine-tuning-based methods and up to a 5% gain over reasoning-specialized pipelines under identical retrieval conditions. Crucially, ComposeRAG significantly enhances grounding: its verification-first design reduces ungrounded answers by over 10% in low-quality retrieval settings, and by approximately 3% even with strong corpora. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the modular architecture, demonstrating distinct and additive contributions from each component. These findings underscore ComposeRAG's capacity to deliver flexible, transparent, scalable, and high-performing multi-hop reasoning with improved grounding and interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[REIC: RAG-Enhanced Intent Classification at Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00210v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate intent classification is critical for efficient routing in customer service, ensuring customers are connected with the most suitable agents while reducing handling times and operational costs. However, as companies expand their product lines, intent classification faces scalability challenges due to the increasing number of intents and variations in taxonomy across different verticals. In this paper, we introduce REIC, a Retrieval-augmented generation Enhanced Intent Classification approach, which addresses these challenges effectively. REIC leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to dynamically incorporate relevant knowledge, enabling precise classification without the need for frequent retraining. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that REIC outperforms traditional fine-tuning, zero-shot, and few-shot methods in large-scale customer service settings. Our results highlight its effectiveness in both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, demonstrating its potential for real-world deployment in adaptive and large-scale intent classification systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[The RAG Paradox: A Black-Box Attack Exploiting Unintentional Vulnerabilities in Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20995v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing adoption of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, various attack methods have been proposed to degrade their performance. However, most existing approaches rely on unrealistic assumptions in which external attackers have access to internal components such as the retriever. To address this issue, we introduce a realistic black-box attack based on the RAG paradox, a structural vulnerability arising from the system's effort to enhance trust by revealing both the retrieved documents and their sources to users. This transparency enables attackers to observe which sources are used and how information is phrased, allowing them to craft poisoned documents that are more likely to be retrieved and upload them to the identified sources. Moreover, as RAG systems directly provide retrieved content to users, these documents must not only be retrievable but also appear natural and credible to maintain user confidence in the search results. Unlike prior work that focuses solely on improving document retrievability, our attack method explicitly considers both retrievability and user trust in the retrieved content. Both offline and online experiments demonstrate that our method significantly degrades system performance without internal access, while generating natural-looking poisoned documents.</p></details> |  |

A robust benchmark dataset must satisfy three key criteria: quality, diversity, and difficulty, which capturing the complexity of reasoning based on hops and the distribution of supporting evidence. In this paper, we propose MHTS (Multi-Hop Tree Structure), a novel dataset synthesis framework that systematically controls multi-hop reasoning complexity by leveraging a multi-hop tree structure to generate logically connected, multi-chunk queries. Our fine-grained difficulty estimation formula exhibits a strong correlation with the overall performance metrics of a RAG system, validating its effectiveness in assessing both retrieval and answer generation capabilities. By ensuring high-quality, diverse, and difficulty-controlled queries, our approach enhances RAG evaluation and benchmarking capabilities.</p></details> |  |

However, despite their widespread use, popular datasets such as WebQSP and CWQ suffer from critical quality issues, including inaccurate or incomplete ground-truth annotations, poorly constructed questions that are ambiguous, trivial, or unanswerable, and outdated or inconsistent knowledge. Through a manual audit of 16 popular KGQA datasets, including WebQSP and CWQ, we find that the average factual correctness rate is only 57 %. To address these issues, we introduce KGQAGen, an LLM-in-the-loop framework that systematically resolves these pitfalls. KGQAGen combines structured knowledge grounding, LLM-guided generation, and symbolic verification to produce challenging and verifiable QA instances. Using KGQAGen, we construct KGQAGen-10k, a ten-thousand scale benchmark grounded in Wikidata, and evaluate a diverse set of KG-RAG models. Experimental results demonstrate that even state-of-the-art systems struggle on this benchmark, highlighting its ability to expose limitations of existing models. Our findings advocate for more rigorous benchmark construction and position KGQAGen as a scalable framework for advancing KGQA evaluation.</p></details> | 9 pages |

We experimented with various Large Language Models (LLMs) and integrated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance the generation process. We incorporate a LLM feedback mechanism to improve the quality of the generated content and propose an LLM-as-a-judge approach for evaluation.

Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods attempt to address this by retrieving globally relevant images, but they fail when no single image contains all desired elements from a complex user query. We propose Cross-modal RAG, a novel framework that decomposes both queries and images into sub-dimensional components, enabling subquery-aware retrieval and generation. Our method introduces a hybrid retrieval strategy - combining a sub-dimensional sparse retriever with a dense retriever - to identify a Pareto-optimal set of images, each contributing complementary aspects of the query. During generation, a multimodal large language model is guided to selectively condition on relevant visual features aligned to specific subqueries, ensuring subquery-aware image synthesis. Extensive experiments on MS-COCO, Flickr30K, WikiArt, CUB, and ImageNet-LT demonstrate that Cross-modal RAG significantly outperforms existing baselines in both retrieval and generation quality, while maintaining high efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[DocReRank: Single-Page Hard Negative Query Generation for Training Multi-Modal RAG Rerankers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22584v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rerankers play a critical role in multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by refining ranking of an initial set of retrieved documents. Rerankers are typically trained using hard negative mining, whose goal is to select pages for each query which rank high, but are actually irrelevant. However, this selection process is typically passive and restricted to what the retriever can find in the available corpus, leading to several inherent limitations. These include: limited diversity, negative examples which are often not hard enough, low controllability, and frequent false negatives which harm training. Our paper proposes an alternative approach: Single-Page Hard Negative Query Generation, which goes the other way around. Instead of retrieving negative pages per query, we generate hard negative queries per page. Using an automated LLM-VLM pipeline, and given a page and its positive query, we create hard negatives by rephrasing the query to be as similar as possible in form and context, yet not answerable from the page. This paradigm enables fine-grained control over the generated queries, resulting in diverse, hard, and targeted negatives. It also supports efficient false negative verification. Our experiments show that rerankers trained with data generated using our approach outperform existing models and significantly improve retrieval performance.</p></details> |  |

However, current LLM-based evaluation frameworks predominantly rely on directly prompting resource-intensive models with complex multi-stage prompts, underutilizing models' reasoning capabilities and introducing significant computational cost. In this paper, we present RAG-Zeval (RAG-Zero Evaluator), a novel end-to-end framework that formulates faithfulness and correctness evaluation as a rule-guided reasoning task. Our approach trains evaluators with reinforcement learning, facilitating compact models to generate comprehensive and sound assessments with detailed explanation in one-pass. We introduce a ranking-based outcome reward mechanism, using preference judgments rather than absolute scores, to address the challenge of obtaining precise pointwise reward signals. To this end, we synthesize the ranking references by generating quality-controlled responses with zero human annotation. Experiments demonstrate RAG-Zeval's superior performance, achieving the strongest correlation with human judgments and outperforming baselines that rely on LLMs with 10-100 times more parameters. Our approach also exhibits superior interpretability in response evaluation.</p></details> |  |

However, existing VLM often generate inaccurate answers due to a lack of up-to-date knowledge. To address this issue, recent research has introduced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, commonly used in Large Language Models (LLM), into VLM, incorporating external multi-modal knowledge to enhance the accuracy and practicality of VLM systems. Nevertheless, the RAG in LLM may be susceptible to data poisoning attacks. RAG-based VLM may also face the threat of this attack. This paper first reveals the vulnerabilities of the RAG-based large model under poisoning attack, showing that existing single-modal RAG poisoning attacks have a 100\% failure rate in multi-modal RAG scenarios. To address this gap, we propose Spa-VLM (Stealthy Poisoning Attack on RAG-based VLM), a new paradigm for poisoning attacks on large models. We carefully craft malicious multi-modal knowledge entries, including adversarial images and misleading text, which are then injected into the RAG's knowledge base. When users access the VLM service, the system may generate misleading outputs. We evaluate Spa-VLM on two Wikipedia datasets and across two different RAGs. Results demonstrate that our method achieves highly stealthy poisoning, with the attack success rate exceeding 0.8 after injecting just 5 malicious entries into knowledge bases with 100K and 2M entries, outperforming state-of-the-art poisoning attacks designed for RAG-based LLMs. Additionally, we evaluated several defense mechanisms, all of which ultimately proved ineffective against Spa-VLM, underscoring the effectiveness and robustness of our attack.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAGPPI: RAG Benchmark for Protein-Protein Interactions in Drug Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23823v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieving the biological impacts of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is essential for target identification (Target ID) in drug development. Given the vast number of proteins involved, this process remains time-consuming and challenging. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks have supported Target ID; however, no benchmark currently exists for identifying the biological impacts of PPIs. To bridge this gap, we introduce the RAG Benchmark for PPIs (RAGPPI), a factual question-answer benchmark of 4,420 question-answer pairs that focus on the potential biological impacts of PPIs. Through interviews with experts, we identified criteria for a benchmark dataset, such as a type of QA and source. We built a gold-standard dataset (500 QA pairs) through expert-driven data annotation. We developed an ensemble auto-evaluation LLM that reflected expert labeling characteristics, which facilitates the construction of a silver-standard dataset (3,720 QA pairs). We are committed to maintaining RAGPPI as a resource to support the research community in advancing RAG systems for drug discovery QA solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 4 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

To improve the robustness of such systems against noisy retrievals, Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning (RAFT) has emerged as a widely adopted method. However, RAFT conditions models to generate answers even in the absence of reliable knowledge. This behavior undermines their reliability in high-stakes domains, where acknowledging uncertainty is critical. To address this issue, we propose Divide-Then-Align (DTA), a post-training approach designed to endow RAG systems with the ability to respond with "I don't know" when the query is out of the knowledge boundary of both the retrieved passages and the model's internal knowledge. DTA divides data samples into four knowledge quadrants and constructs tailored preference data for each quadrant, resulting in a curated dataset for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that DTA effectively balances accuracy with appropriate abstention, enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of retrieval-augmented systems.</p></details> | ACL 2025 main |

In real-world scenarios, user questions often require retrieving answers that are distributed across multiple tables. GraphRAG has recently attracted much attention for enhancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities by organizing external knowledge to address ad-hoc and complex questions, exemplifying a promising direction for cross-table question answering. In this paper, to address the current gap in available data, we first introduce a multi-table benchmark, MutliTableQA, comprising 60k tables and 25k user queries collected from real-world sources. Then, we propose the first Graph-Table-RAG framework, namely GTR, which reorganizes table corpora into a heterogeneous graph, employs a hierarchical coarse-to-fine retrieval process to extract the most relevant tables, and integrates graph-aware prompting for downstream LLMs' tabular reasoning. Extensive experiments show that GTR exhibits superior cross-table question-answering performance while maintaining high deployment efficiency, demonstrating its real-world practical applicability.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |

To bridge this gap, we propose DoctorRAG, a RAG framework that emulates doctor-like reasoning by integrating both explicit clinical knowledge and implicit case-based experience. DoctorRAG enhances retrieval precision by first allocating conceptual tags for queries and knowledge sources, together with a hybrid retrieval mechanism from both relevant knowledge and patient. In addition, a Med-TextGrad module using multi-agent textual gradients is integrated to ensure that the final output adheres to the retrieved knowledge and patient query. Comprehensive experiments on multilingual, multitask datasets demonstrate that DoctorRAG significantly outperforms strong baseline RAG models and gains improvements from iterative refinements. Our approach generates more accurate, relevant, and comprehensive responses, taking a step towards more doctor-like medical reasoning systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

A plethora of things in human life, such as lifestyle, health, and food are dependent on the environment and agriculture. It comes under our responsibility to support the environment as well as agriculture. However, traditional farming practices often result in inefficient resource use and environmental challenges. To address these issues, precision agriculture has emerged as a promising approach that leverages advanced technologies to optimise agricultural processes. In this work, a hybrid approach is proposed that combines the three different potential fields of model AI: object detection, large language model (LLM), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). In this novel framework, we have tried to combine the vision and language models to work together to identify potential diseases in the tree leaf. This study introduces a novel AI-based precision agriculture system that uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide context-aware diagnoses and natural language processing (NLP) and YOLOv8 for crop disease detection. The system aims to tackle major issues with large language models (LLMs), especially hallucinations and allows for adaptive treatment plans and real-time disease detection. The system provides an easy-to-use interface to the farmers, which they can use to detect the different diseases related to coffee leaves by just submitting the image of the affected leaf the model will detect the diseases as well as suggest potential remediation methodologies which aim to lower the use of pesticides, preserving livelihoods, and encouraging environmentally friendly methods. With an emphasis on scalability, dependability, and user-friendliness, the project intends to improve RAG-integrated object detection systems for wider agricultural applications in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>There...</summary><p>There are 14 pages, 8 figures</p></details> |

To address this, we propose Debate-Augmented RAG (DRAG), a training-free framework that integrates Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) mechanisms into both retrieval and generation stages. In retrieval, DRAG employs structured debates among proponents, opponents, and judges to refine retrieval quality and ensure factual reliability. In generation, DRAG introduces asymmetric information roles and adversarial debates, enhancing reasoning robustness and mitigating factual inconsistencies. Evaluations across multiple tasks demonstrate that DRAG improves retrieval reliability, reduces RAG-induced hallucinations, and significantly enhances overall factual accuracy.

This study explores whether a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach using only the most relevant text segments can match the performance of processing entire clinical notes with large context LLMs. We begin by splitting clinical documents into smaller chunks, converting them into vector embeddings, and storing these in a FAISS index. We then retrieve the top 4,000 words most pertinent to the classification query and feed these consolidated segments into an LLM. We evaluated three LLMs (GPT4o, LLaMA, and Mistral) on a surgical complication identification task. Metrics such as AUC ROC, precision, recall, and F1 showed no statistically significant differences between the RAG based approach and whole-text processing (p > 0.05p > 0.05). These findings indicate that RAG can significantly reduce token usage without sacrificing classification accuracy, providing a scalable and cost effective solution for analyzing lengthy clinical documents.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing RAG research in finance focuses predominantly on textual data, overlooking the rich visual content in financial documents, resulting in the loss of key analytical insights. To bridge this gap, we present FinRAGBench-V, a comprehensive visual RAG benchmark tailored for finance which effectively integrates multimodal data and provides visual citation to ensure traceability. It includes a bilingual retrieval corpus with 60,780 Chinese and 51,219 English pages, along with a high-quality, human-annotated question-answering (QA) dataset spanning heterogeneous data types and seven question categories. Moreover, we introduce RGenCite, an RAG baseline that seamlessly integrates visual citation with generation. Furthermore, we propose an automatic citation evaluation method to systematically assess the visual citation capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Extensive experiments on RGenCite underscore the challenging nature of FinRAGBench-V, providing valuable insights for the development of multimodal RAG systems in finance.</p></details> |  |

VoxRAG employs silence-aware segmentation, speaker diarization, CLAP audio embeddings, and FAISS retrieval using L2-normalized cosine similarity. We construct a 50-query test set recorded as spoken input by a native English speaker. Retrieval quality was evaluated using LLM-as-a-judge annotations. For very relevant segments, cosine similarity achieved a Recall@10 of 0.34. For somewhat relevant segments, Recall@10 rose to 0.60 and nDCG@10 to 0.27, highlighting strong topical alignment. Answer quality was judged on a 0--2 scale across relevance, accuracy, completeness, and precision, with mean scores of 0.84, 0.58, 0.56, and 0.46 respectively. While precision and retrieval quality remain key limitations, VoxRAG shows that transcription-free speech-to-speech retrieval is feasible in RAG systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 Workshop MAGMaR</p></details> |

A large enough context ensures that the relevant information is present in the input context for the LLM, but also incorporates irrelevant content that has been shown to confuse the models. On the other hand, a smaller context reduces the irrelevant information, but it often comes at the risk of losing important information necessary to answer the input question. This duality is especially challenging to manage for complex queries that contain little information to retrieve the relevant chunks from the full context. To address this, we present a novel framework, called FB-RAG, which enhances the RAG pipeline by relying on a combination of backward lookup (overlap with the query) and forward lookup (overlap with candidate reasons and answers) to retrieve specific context chunks that are the most relevant for answering the input query. Our evaluations on 9 datasets from two leading benchmarks show that FB-RAG consistently outperforms RAG and Long Context baselines developed recently for these benchmarks. We further show that FB-RAG can improve performance while reducing latency. We perform qualitative analysis of the strengths and shortcomings of our approach, providing specific insights to guide future work.</p></details> |  |

To overcome the limitations of existing methods, this paper shifts away from prior dedicated heuristic approaches and revisits the most fundamental idea to HR perception by enhancing the long-context capability of MLLMs, driven by recent advances in long-context techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for general LLMs. Towards this end, this paper presents the first study exploring the use of RAG to address HR perception challenges. Specifically, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Perception (RAP), a training-free framework that retrieves and fuses relevant image crops while preserving spatial context using the proposed Spatial-Awareness Layout. To accommodate different tasks, the proposed Retrieved-Exploration Search (RE-Search) dynamically selects the optimal number of crops based on model confidence and retrieval scores. Experimental results on HR benchmarks demonstrate the significant effectiveness of RAP, with LLaVA-v1.5-13B achieving a 43% improvement on $V^*$ Bench and 19% on HR-Bench.</p></details> |  |

At Volvo Construction Equipment (VCE), customer personas have traditionally been developed through qualitative methods, which are time-consuming and lack scalability. The main objective of this paper is to generate synthetic customer personas and integrate them into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot to support decision-making in business processes. To this end, we first focus on developing a persona-based RAG chatbot integrated with verified personas. Next, synthetic personas are generated using Few-Shot and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting techniques and evaluated based on completeness, relevance, and consistency using McNemar's test. In the final step, the chatbot's knowledge base is augmented with synthetic personas and additional segment information to assess improvements in response accuracy and practical utility. Key findings indicate that Few-Shot prompting outperformed CoT in generating more complete personas, while CoT demonstrated greater efficiency in terms of response time and token usage. After augmenting the knowledge base, the average accuracy rating of the chatbot increased from 5.88 to 6.42 on a 10-point scale, and 81.82% of participants found the updated system useful in business contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Process vs. Outcome Reward: Which is Better for Agentic RAG Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14069v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances the text generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge and up-to-date information. However, traditional RAG systems are limited by static workflows and lack the adaptability required for multistep reasoning and complex task management. To address these limitations, agentic RAG systems (e.g., DeepResearch) have been proposed, enabling dynamic retrieval strategies, iterative context refinement, and adaptive workflows for handling complex search queries beyond the capabilities of conventional RAG. Recent advances, such as Search-R1, have demonstrated promising gains using outcome-based reinforcement learning, where the correctness of the final answer serves as the reward signal. Nevertheless, such outcome-supervised agentic RAG methods face challenges including low exploration efficiency, gradient conflict, and sparse reward signals. To overcome these challenges, we propose to utilize fine-grained, process-level rewards to improve training stability, reduce computational costs, and enhance efficiency. Specifically, we introduce a novel method ReasonRAG that automatically constructs RAG-ProGuide, a high-quality dataset providing process-level rewards for (i) query generation, (ii) evidence extraction, and (iii) answer generation, thereby enhancing model inherent capabilities via process-supervised reinforcement learning. With the process-level policy optimization, the proposed framework empowers LLMs to autonomously invoke search, generate queries, extract relevant evidence, and produce final answers. Compared to existing approaches such as Search-R1 and traditional RAG systems, ReasonRAG, leveraging RAG-ProGuide, achieves superior performance on five benchmark datasets using only 5k training instances, significantly fewer than the 90k training instances required by Search-R1.</p></details> |  |

A Fact-Checking Dataset for Evaluating the Robustness of RAG Against Misleading Retrievals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16101v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has shown impressive capabilities in mitigating hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs struggle to handle misleading retrievals and often fail to maintain their own reasoning when exposed to conflicting or selectively-framed evidence, making them vulnerable to real-world misinformation. In such real-world retrieval scenarios, misleading and conflicting information is rampant, particularly in the political domain, where evidence is often selectively framed, incomplete, or polarized. However, existing RAG benchmarks largely assume a clean retrieval setting, where models succeed by accurately retrieving and generating answers from gold-standard documents. This assumption fails to align with real-world conditions, leading to an overestimation of RAG system performance. To bridge this gap, we introduce RAGuard, a fact-checking dataset designed to evaluate the robustness of RAG systems against misleading retrievals. Unlike prior benchmarks that rely on synthetic noise, our dataset constructs its retrieval corpus from Reddit discussions, capturing naturally occurring misinformation. It categorizes retrieved evidence into three types: supporting, misleading, and irrelevant, providing a realistic and challenging testbed for assessing how well RAG systems navigate different retrieval information. Our benchmark experiments reveal that when exposed to misleading retrievals, all tested LLM-powered RAG systems perform worse than their zero-shot baselines (i.e., no retrieval at all), highlighting their susceptibility to noisy environments. To the best of our knowledge, RAGuard is the first benchmark to systematically assess RAG robustness against misleading evidence. We expect this benchmark will drive future research toward improving RAG systems beyond idealized datasets, making them more reliable for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[After Retrieval, Before Generation: Enhancing the Trustworthiness of Large Language Models in RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17118v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems face critical challenges in balancing internal (parametric) and external (retrieved) knowledge, especially when these sources conflict or are unreliable. To analyze these scenarios comprehensively, we construct the Trustworthiness Response Dataset (TRD) with 36,266 questions spanning four RAG settings. We reveal that existing approaches address isolated scenarios-prioritizing one knowledge source, naively merging both, or refusing answers-but lack a unified framework to handle different real-world conditions simultaneously. Therefore, we propose the BRIDGE framework, which dynamically determines a comprehensive response strategy of large language models (LLMs). BRIDGE leverages an adaptive weighting mechanism named soft bias to guide knowledge collection, followed by a Maximum Soft-bias Decision Tree to evaluate knowledge and select optimal response strategies (trust internal/external knowledge, or refuse). Experiments show BRIDGE outperforms baselines by 5-15% in accuracy while maintaining balanced performance across all scenarios. Our work provides an effective solution for LLMs' trustworthy responses in real-world RAG applications.</p></details> | 24 pages, 8 figures |

Existing extraction methods typically rely on malicious inputs such as prompt injection or jailbreaking, making them easily detectable via input- or output-level detection. In this paper, we introduce Implicit Knowledge Extraction Attack (IKEA), which conducts knowledge extraction on RAG systems through benign queries. IKEA first leverages anchor concepts to generate queries with the natural appearance, and then designs two mechanisms to lead to anchor concept thoroughly 'explore' the RAG's privacy knowledge: (1) Experience Reflection Sampling, which samples anchor concepts based on past query-response patterns to ensure the queries' relevance to RAG documents; (2) Trust Region Directed Mutation, which iteratively mutates anchor concepts under similarity constraints to further exploit the embedding space. Extensive experiments demonstrate IKEA's effectiveness under various defenses, surpassing baselines by over 80% in extraction efficiency and 90% in attack success rate. Moreover, the substitute RAG system built from IKEA's extractions consistently outperforms those based on baseline methods across multiple evaluation tasks, underscoring the significant privacy risk in RAG systems.</p></details> |  |

This capability enhances the quality and accuracy of responses but also introduces novel security and privacy challenges, particularly when sensitive data is integrated. With the rapid adoption of RAG, securing data and services has become a critical priority. This paper first reviews the vulnerabilities of RAG pipelines, and outlines the attack surface from data pre-processing and data storage management to integration with LLMs. The identified risks are then paired with corresponding mitigations in a structured overview. In a second step, the paper develops a framework that combines RAG-specific security considerations, with existing general security guidelines, industry standards, and best practices. The proposed framework aims to guide the implementation of robust, compliant, secure, and trustworthy RAG systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, Sara Ott and Lukas Ammann contributed equally.

A Comparative Study on LCMs-based Code Completion in Industry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15179v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code completion, a crucial practice in industrial settings, helps developers improve programming efficiency by automatically suggesting code snippets during development. With the emergence of Large Code Models (LCMs), this field has witnessed significant advancements. Due to the natural differences between open-source and industrial codebases, such as coding patterns and unique internal dependencies, it is a common practice for developers to conduct domain adaptation when adopting LCMs in industry. There exist multiple adaptation approaches, among which retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and fine-tuning are the two most popular paradigms. However, no prior research has explored the trade-off of the two approaches in industrial scenarios. To mitigate the gap, we comprehensively compare the two paradigms including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Fine-tuning (FT), for industrial code completion in this paper. In collaboration with Tencent's WXG department, we collect over 160,000 internal C++ files as our codebase. We then compare the two types of adaptation approaches from three dimensions that are concerned by industrial practitioners, including effectiveness, efficiency, and parameter sensitivity, using six LCMs. Our findings reveal that RAG, when implemented with appropriate embedding models that map code snippets into dense vector representations, can achieve higher accuracy than fine-tuning alone. Specifically, BM25 presents superior retrieval effectiveness and efficiency among studied RAG methods. Moreover, RAG and fine-tuning are orthogonal and their combination leads to further improvement. We also observe that RAG demonstrates better scalability than FT, showing more sustained performance gains with larger scales of codebase.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in FSE 25 Industry Track</p></details> |

However, existing RAG systems often suffer from imprecise retrieval, incomplete context coverage under constrained windows, and fragmented information from suboptimal context construction. We introduce Multi-scale Adaptive Context RAG (MacRAG), a hierarchical RAG framework that compresses and partitions documents into coarse-to-fine granularities, then adaptively merges relevant contexts through real-time chunk- and document-level expansions. By initiating with finest-level retrieval and progressively incorporating broader, higher-level context, MacRAG constructs effective query-specific long contexts, optimizing both precision and coverage. Evaluations on challenging LongBench expansions of HotpotQA, 2WikiMultihopQA, and Musique confirm MacRAG consistently surpasses baseline RAG pipelines in single- and multi-step generation using Llama-3.1-8B, Gemini-1.5-pro, and GPT-4o. Our results establish MacRAG as an efficient, scalable solution for real-world long-context, multi-hop reasoning. Our code is available at https://github.com/Leezekun/MacRAG.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches often rely on monolithic graph retrieval, incurring unnecessary latency for simple queries and fragmented reasoning for complex multi-hop questions. To address these challenges, this paper propose SPLIT-RAG, a multi-agent RAG framework that addresses these limitations with question-driven semantic graph partitioning and collaborative subgraph retrieval. The innovative framework first create Semantic Partitioning of Linked Information, then use the Type-Specialized knowledge base to achieve Multi-Agent RAG. The attribute-aware graph segmentation manages to divide knowledge graphs into semantically coherent subgraphs, ensuring subgraphs align with different query types, while lightweight LLM agents are assigned to partitioned subgraphs, and only relevant partitions are activated during retrieval, thus reduce search space while enhancing efficiency. Finally, a hierarchical merging module resolves inconsistencies across subgraph-derived answers through logical verifications. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates considerable improvements compared to existing approaches.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |

This study presents a novel multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation-based framework that automates anomaly detection across various Additive Manufacturing processes leveraging retrieved information from literature, including images and descriptive text, rather than training datasets. This framework integrates text and image retrieval from scientific literature and multimodal generation models to perform zero-shot anomaly identification, classification, and explanation generation in a Laser Powder Bed Fusion setting. The proposed framework is evaluated on four L-PBF manufacturing datasets from Oak Ridge National Laboratory, featuring various printer makes, models, and materials. This evaluation demonstrates the framework's adaptability and generalizability across diverse images without requiring additional training. Comparative analysis using Qwen2-VL-2B and GPT-4o-mini as MLLM within the proposed framework highlights that GPT-4o-mini outperforms Qwen2-VL-2B and proportional random baseline in manufacturing anomalies classification. Additionally, the evaluation of the RAG system confirms that incorporating retrieval mechanisms improves average accuracy by 12% by reducing the risk of hallucination and providing additional information. The proposed framework can be continuously updated by integrating emerging research, allowing seamless adaptation to the evolving landscape of AM technologies. This scalable, automated, and zero-shot-capable framework streamlines AM anomaly analysis, enhancing efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>ASME ...</summary><p>ASME 2025 International Design Engineering Technical Conferences and Computers and Information in Engineering Conference IDETC/CIE2025, August 17-20, 2025, Anaheim, CA (IDETC2025-168615)</p></details> |

We observe that for different queries, it could retrieve similar subgraphs as prompts, and thus we propose SubGCache, which aims to reduce inference latency by reusing computation across queries with similar structural prompts (i.e., subgraphs). Specifically, SubGCache clusters queries based on subgraph embeddings, constructs a representative subgraph for each cluster, and pre-computes the key-value (KV) cache of the representative subgraph. For each query with its retrieved subgraph within a cluster, it reuses the pre-computed KV cache of the representative subgraph of the cluster without computing the KV tensors again for saving computation. Experiments on two new datasets across multiple LLM backbones and graph-based RAG frameworks demonstrate that SubGCache consistently reduces inference latency with comparable and even improved generation quality, achieving up to 6.68$\times$ reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT).</p></details> |  |
| **[Effective and Transparent RAG: Adaptive-Reward Reinforcement Learning for Decision Traceability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13258v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly improved the performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive domains. However, although RAG achieved successes across distinct domains, there are still some unsolved challenges: 1) Effectiveness. Existing research mainly focuses on developing more powerful RAG retrievers, but how to enhance the generator's (LLM's) ability to utilize the retrieved information for reasoning and generation? 2) Transparency. Most RAG methods ignore which retrieved content actually contributes to the reasoning process, resulting in a lack of interpretability and visibility. To address this, we propose ARENA (Adaptive-Rewarded Evidence Navigation Agent), a transparent RAG generator framework trained via reinforcement learning (RL) with our proposed rewards. Based on the structured generation and adaptive reward calculation, our RL-based training enables the model to identify key evidence, perform structured reasoning, and generate answers with interpretable decision traces. Applied to Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, abundant experiments with various RAG baselines demonstrate that our model achieves 10-30% improvements on all multi-hop QA datasets, which is comparable with the SOTA Commercially-developed LLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1, DeepSeek-R1). Further analyses show that ARENA has strong flexibility to be adopted on new datasets without extra training. Our models and codes are publicly released.</p></details> |  |

To contribute to this, we implemented a Conversational AI system that enables staff in an airport to communicate with flight information systems. This system not only answers standard airport queries but also resolves airport terminology, jargon, abbreviations, and dynamic questions involving reasoning. In this paper, we built three different Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods, including traditional RAG, SQL RAG, and Knowledge Graph-based RAG (Graph RAG). Experiments showed that traditional RAG achieved 84.84% accuracy using BM25 + GPT-4 but occasionally produced hallucinations, which is risky to airport safety. In contrast, SQL RAG and Graph RAG achieved 80.85% and 91.49% accuracy respectively, with significantly fewer hallucinations. Moreover, Graph RAG was especially effective for questions that involved reasoning. Based on our observations, we thus recommend SQL RAG and Graph RAG are better for airport environments, due to fewer hallucinations and the ability to handle dynamic questions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NAACL 2025 industry track</p></details> |
| **[AMAQA: A Metadata-based QA Dataset for RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13557v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are widely used in question-answering (QA) tasks, but current benchmarks lack metadata integration, hindering evaluation in scenarios requiring both textual data and external information. To address this, we present AMAQA, a new open-access QA dataset designed to evaluate tasks combining text and metadata. The integration of metadata is especially important in fields that require rapid analysis of large volumes of data, such as cybersecurity and intelligence, where timely access to relevant information is critical. AMAQA includes about 1.1 million English messages collected from 26 public Telegram groups, enriched with metadata such as timestamps, topics, emotional tones, and toxicity indicators, which enable precise and contextualized queries by filtering documents based on specific criteria. It also includes 450 high-quality QA pairs, making it a valuable resource for advancing research on metadata-driven QA and RAG systems. To the best of our knowledge, AMAQA is the first single-hop QA benchmark to incorporate metadata and labels such as topics covered in the messages. We conduct extensive tests on the benchmark, establishing a new standard for future research. We show that leveraging metadata boosts accuracy from 0.12 to 0.61, highlighting the value of structured context. Building on this, we explore several strategies to refine the LLM input by iterating over provided context and enriching it with noisy documents, achieving a further 3-point gain over the best baseline and a 14-point improvement over simple metadata filtering. The dataset is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AMAQA-5D0D/</p></details> |  |
| **[Know3-RAG: A Knowledge-aware RAG Framework with Adaptive Retrieval, Generation, and Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12662v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to impressive progress in natural language generation, yet their tendency to produce hallucinated or unsubstantiated content remains a critical concern. To improve factual reliability, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates external knowledge during inference. However, existing RAG systems face two major limitations: (1) unreliable adaptive control due to limited external knowledge supervision, and (2) hallucinations caused by inaccurate or irrelevant references. To address these issues, we propose Know3-RAG, a knowledge-aware RAG framework that leverages structured knowledge from knowledge graphs (KGs) to guide three core stages of the RAG process, including retrieval, generation, and filtering. Specifically, we introduce a knowledge-aware adaptive retrieval module that employs KG embedding to assess the confidence of the generated answer and determine retrieval necessity, a knowledge-enhanced reference generation strategy that enriches queries with KG-derived entities to improve generated reference relevance, and a knowledge-driven reference filtering mechanism that ensures semantic alignment and factual accuracy of references. Experiments on multiple open-domain QA benchmarks demonstrate that Know3-RAG consistently outperforms strong baselines, significantly reducing hallucinations and enhancing answer reliability.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAGXplain: From Explainable Evaluation to Actionable Guidance of RAG Pipelines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13538v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems show promise by coupling large language models with external knowledge, yet traditional RAG evaluation methods primarily report quantitative scores while offering limited actionable guidance for refining these complex pipelines. In this paper, we introduce RAGXplain, an evaluation framework that quantifies RAG performance and translates these assessments into clear insights that clarify the workings of its complex, multi-stage pipeline and offer actionable recommendations. Using LLM reasoning, RAGXplain converts raw scores into coherent narratives identifying performance gaps and suggesting targeted improvements. By providing transparent explanations for AI decision-making, our framework fosters user trust-a key challenge in AI adoption. Our LLM-based metric assessments show strong alignment with human judgments, and experiments on public question-answering datasets confirm that applying RAGXplain's actionable recommendations measurably improves system performance. RAGXplain thus bridges quantitative evaluation and practical optimization, empowering users to understand, trust, and enhance their AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAGSynth: Synthetic Data for Robust and Faithful RAG Component Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10989v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RAG can enhance the performance of LLMs on knowledge-intensive tasks. Various RAG paradigms, including vanilla, planning-based, and iterative RAG, are built upon 2 cores: the retriever, which should robustly select relevant documents across complex queries, and the generator, which should faithfully synthesize responses. However, existing retrievers rely heavily on public knowledge and struggle with queries of varying logical complexity and clue completeness, while generators frequently face fidelity problems. In this work, we introduce RAGSynth, a framework that includes a data construction modeling and a corresponding synthetic data generation implementation, designed to optimize retriever robustness and generator fidelity. Additionally, we present SynthBench, a benchmark encompassing 8 domain-specific documents across 4 domains, featuring diverse query complexities, clue completeness, and fine-grained citation granularity. Leveraging RAGSynth, we generate a large-scale synthetic dataset, including single and multi-hop. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the synthetic data significantly improves the robustness of the retrievers and the fidelity of the generators. Additional evaluations confirm that RAGSynth can also generalize well across different domains. By integrating the optimized retrievers into various RAG paradigms, we consistently observe enhanced RAG system performance. We have open-sourced the implementation on https://github.com/EachSheep/RAGSynth.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Automated Situation Awareness: A RAG-Based Framework for Peacebuilding Reports](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10586v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Timely and accurate situation awareness is vital for decision-making in humanitarian response, conflict monitoring, and early warning and early action. However, the manual analysis of vast and heterogeneous data sources often results in delays, limiting the effectiveness of interventions. This paper introduces a dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that autonomously generates situation awareness reports by integrating real-time data from diverse sources, including news articles, conflict event databases, and economic indicators. Our system constructs query-specific knowledge bases on demand, ensuring timely, relevant, and accurate insights. To ensure the quality of generated reports, we propose a three-level evaluation framework that combines semantic similarity metrics, factual consistency checks, and expert feedback. The first level employs automated NLP metrics to assess coherence and factual accuracy. The second level involves human expert evaluation to verify the relevance and completeness of the reports. The third level utilizes LLM-as-a-Judge, where large language models provide an additional layer of assessment to ensure robustness. The system is tested across multiple real-world scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing coherent, insightful, and actionable reports. By automating report generation, our approach reduces the burden on human analysts and accelerates decision-making processes. To promote reproducibility and further research, we openly share our code and evaluation tools with the community via GitHub.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAG-Enabled Intent Reasoning for Application-Network Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09339v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intent-based network (IBN) is a promising solution to automate network operation and management. IBN aims to offer human-tailored network interaction, allowing the network to communicate in a way that aligns with the network users' language, rather than requiring the network users to understand the technical language of the network/devices. Nowadays, different applications interact with the network, each with its own specialized needs and domain language. Creating semantic languages (i.e., ontology-based languages) and associating them with each application to facilitate intent translation lacks technical expertise and is neither practical nor scalable. To tackle the aforementioned problem, we propose a context-aware AI framework that utilizes machine reasoning (MR), retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and generative AI technologies to interpret intents from different applications and generate structured network intents. The proposed framework allows for generalized/domain-specific intent expression and overcomes the drawbacks of large language models (LLMs) and vanilla-RAG framework. The experimental results show that our proposed intent-RAG framework outperforms the LLM and vanilla-RAG framework in intent translation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving the Reliability of LLMs: Combining CoT, RAG, Self-Consistency, and Self-Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09031v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucination, where large language models (LLMs) generate confident but incorrect or irrelevant information, remains a key limitation in their application to complex, open-ended tasks. Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a promising method for improving multistep reasoning by guiding models through intermediate steps. However, CoT alone does not fully address the hallucination problem. In this work, we investigate how combining CoT with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), as well as applying self-consistency and self-verification strategies, can reduce hallucinations and improve factual accuracy. By incorporating external knowledge sources during reasoning and enabling models to verify or revise their own outputs, we aim to generate more accurate and coherent responses. We present a comparative evaluation of baseline LLMs against CoT, CoT+RAG, self-consistency, and self-verification techniques. Our results highlight the effectiveness of each method and identify the most robust approach for minimizing hallucinations while preserving fluency and reasoning depth.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Thyroid Cytology Diagnosis with RAG-Optimized LLMs and Pa-thology Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08590v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming pathology by integrat-ing large language models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and domain-specific foundation models. This study explores the application of RAG-enhanced LLMs coupled with pathology foundation models for thyroid cytology diagnosis, addressing challenges in cytological interpretation, standardization, and diagnostic accuracy. By leveraging a curated knowledge base, RAG facilitates dy-namic retrieval of relevant case studies, diagnostic criteria, and expert interpreta-tion, improving the contextual understanding of LLMs. Meanwhile, pathology foun-dation models, trained on high-resolution pathology images, refine feature extrac-tion and classification capabilities. The fusion of these AI-driven approaches en-hances diagnostic consistency, reduces variability, and supports pathologists in dis-tinguishing benign from malignant thyroid lesions. Our results demonstrate that integrating RAG with pathology-specific LLMs significantly improves diagnostic efficiency and interpretability, paving the way for AI-assisted thyroid cytopathology, with foundation model UNI achieving AUC 0.73-0.93 for correct prediction of surgi-cal pathology diagnosis from thyroid cytology samples.</p></details> |  |
| **[KAQG: A Knowledge-Graph-Enhanced RAG for Difficulty-Controlled Question Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07618v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>KAQG introduces a decisive breakthrough for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by explicitly tackling the two chronic weaknesses of current pipelines: transparent multi-step reasoning and fine-grained cognitive difficulty control. This transforms RAG from a passive retriever into an accountable generator of calibrated exam items. Technically, the framework fuses knowledge graphs, RAG retrieval, and educational assessment theory into a single pipeline. Domain passages are parsed into a structured graph; graph-aware retrieval feeds fact chains to an LLM; and an assessment layer governed by Bloom's Taxonomy levels and Item Response Theory (IRT) transforms those chains into psychometrically sound questions. This cross-disciplinary marriage yields two scholarly contributions: it shows how semantic graph contexts guide LLM reasoning paths, and it operationalizes difficulty metrics within the generation process, producing items whose IRT parameters match expert benchmarks. Every module, from KG construction scripts to the multi-agent reasoning scheduler and the automatic IRT validator, is openly released on GitHub. This enables peer laboratories to replicate experiments, benchmark against baselines, and extend individual components without licensing barriers. Its reproducible design paves the way for rigorous ablation studies, cross-domain transfer experiments, and shared leaderboards on multi-step reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Requirements Engineering for RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07553v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This short paper explores how a maritime company develops and integrates large-language models (LLM). Specifically by looking at the requirements engineering for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in expert settings. Through a case study at a maritime service provider, we demonstrate how data scientists face a fundamental tension between user expectations of AI perfection and the correctness of the generated outputs. Our findings reveal that data scientists must identify context-specific "retrieval requirements" through iterative experimentation together with users because they are the ones who can determine correctness. We present an empirical process model describing how data scientists practically elicited these "retrieval requirements" and managed system limitations. This work advances software engineering knowledge by providing insights into the specialized requirements engineering processes for implementing RAG systems in complex domain-specific applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EASE 2025, 17-20 June, Istanbul, Turkey</p></details> |
| **[The Distracting Effect: Understanding Irrelevant Passages in RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06914v1)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A well-known issue with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is that retrieved passages that are irrelevant to the query sometimes distract the answer-generating LLM, causing it to provide an incorrect response. In this paper, we shed light on this core issue and formulate the distracting effect of a passage w.r.t. a query (and an LLM). We provide a quantifiable measure of the distracting effect of a passage and demonstrate its robustness across LLMs. Our research introduces novel methods for identifying and using hard distracting passages to improve RAG systems. By fine-tuning LLMs with these carefully selected distracting passages, we achieve up to a 7.5% increase in answering accuracy compared to counterparts fine-tuned on conventional RAG datasets. Our contribution is two-fold: first, we move beyond the simple binary classification of irrelevant passages as either completely unrelated vs. distracting, and second, we develop and analyze multiple methods for finding hard distracting passages. To our knowledge, no other research has provided such a comprehensive framework for identifying and utilizing hard distracting passages.</p></details> |  |
