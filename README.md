We introduce EchoInk-R1, a reinforcement learning framework that enhances such reasoning in MLLMs. Built upon the Qwen2.5-Omni-7B foundation and optimized with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), EchoInk-R1 tackles multiple-choice question answering over synchronized audio-image pairs. To enable this, we curate AVQA-R1-6K, a dataset pairing such audio-image inputs with multiple-choice questions derived from OmniInstruct-v1. EchoInk-R1-7B achieves 85.77% accuracy on the validation set, outperforming the base model, which scores 80.53%, using only 562 reinforcement learning steps. Beyond accuracy, EchoInk-R1 demonstrates reflective reasoning by revisiting initial interpretations and refining responses when facing ambiguous multimodal inputs. These results suggest that lightweight reinforcement learning fine-tuning enhances cross-modal reasoning in MLLMs. EchoInk-R1 is the first framework to unify audio, visual, and textual modalities for general open-world reasoning via reinforcement learning. Code and data are publicly released to facilitate further research.</p></details> |  |

Initially limited to understanding multiple modalities, these models have advanced to not only comprehend but also generate across modalities. Their capabilities have expanded from coarse-grained to fine-grained multimodal understanding and from supporting limited modalities to arbitrary ones. While many benchmarks exist to assess MLLMs, a critical question arises: Can we simply assume that higher performance across tasks indicates a stronger MLLM capability, bringing us closer to human-level AI? We argue that the answer is not as straightforward as it seems. This project introduces General-Level, an evaluation framework that defines 5-scale levels of MLLM performance and generality, offering a methodology to compare MLLMs and gauge the progress of existing systems towards more robust multimodal generalists and, ultimately, towards AGI. At the core of the framework is the concept of Synergy, which measures whether models maintain consistent capabilities across comprehension and generation, and across multiple modalities. To support this evaluation, we present General-Bench, which encompasses a broader spectrum of skills, modalities, formats, and capabilities, including over 700 tasks and 325,800 instances. The evaluation results that involve over 100 existing state-of-the-art MLLMs uncover the capability rankings of generalists, highlighting the challenges in reaching genuine AI. We expect this project to pave the way for future research on next-generation multimodal foundation models, providing a robust infrastructure to accelerate the realization of AGI.

| **[OmniGIRL: A Multilingual and Multimodal Benchmark for GitHub Issue Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04606v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The GitHub issue resolution task aims to resolve issues reported in repositories automatically. With advances in large language models (LLMs), this task has gained increasing attention, and several benchmarks are proposed to evaluate the issue resolution ability of LLMs. However, existing benchmarks have three main limitations. First, current benchmarks focus on a single programming language, limiting the evaluation of issues from repositories across different languages. Second, they usually cover a narrow range of domains, which may fail to represent the diversity of real-world issues. Third, existing benchmarks rely solely on textual information in issue descriptions, overlooking multimodal information such as images in issues. In this paper, we propose OmniGIRL, a GitHub Issue ResoLution benchmark that is multilingual, multimodal, and multi-domain. OmniGIRL includes 959 task instances, which are collected from repositories across four programming languages (i.e., Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Java) and eight different domains. Our evaluation shows that current LLMs show limited performances on OmniGIRL. Notably, the best-performing model, GPT-4o, resolves only 8.6% of the issues. Besides, we find that current LLMs struggle to resolve issues requiring understanding images. The best performance is achieved by Claude-3.5-Sonnet, which resolves only 10.5% of the issues with image information. Finally, we analyze the reasons behind current LLMs' failure on OmniGIRL, providing insights for future improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at ISSTA'25</p></details> |
| **[MonoCoP: Chain-of-Prediction for Monocular 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04594v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting 3D attributes is crucial for monocular 3D object detection (Mono3D), with depth estimation posing the greatest challenge due to the inherent ambiguity in mapping 2D images to 3D space. While existing methods leverage multiple depth cues (e.g., estimating depth uncertainty, modeling depth error) to improve depth accuracy, they overlook that accurate depth prediction requires conditioning on other 3D attributes, as these attributes are intrinsically inter-correlated through the 3D to 2D projection, which ultimately limits overall accuracy and stability. Inspired by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in large language models (LLMs), this paper proposes MonoCoP, which leverages a Chain-of-Prediction (CoP) to predict attributes sequentially and conditionally via three key designs. First, it employs a lightweight AttributeNet (AN) for each 3D attribute to learn attribute-specific features. Next, MonoCoP constructs an explicit chain to propagate these learned features from one attribute to the next. Finally, MonoCoP uses a residual connection to aggregate features for each attribute along the chain, ensuring that later attribute predictions are conditioned on all previously processed attributes without forgetting the features of earlier ones. Experimental results show that our MonoCoP achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance on the KITTI leaderboard without requiring additional data and further surpasses existing methods on the Waymo and nuScenes frontal datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[ZeroSearch: Incentivize the Search Capability of LLMs without Searching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04588v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective information searching is essential for enhancing the reasoning and generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Recent research has explored using reinforcement learning (RL) to improve LLMs' search capabilities by interacting with live search engines in real-world environments. While these approaches show promising results, they face two major challenges: (1) Uncontrolled Document Quality: The quality of documents returned by search engines is often unpredictable, introducing noise and instability into the training process. (2) Prohibitively High API Costs: RL training requires frequent rollouts, potentially involving hundreds of thousands of search requests, which incur substantial API expenses and severely constrain scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce ZeroSearch, a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes the search capabilities of LLMs without interacting with real search engines. Our approach begins with lightweight supervised fine-tuning to transform the LLM into a retrieval module capable of generating both relevant and noisy documents in response to a query. During RL training, we employ a curriculum-based rollout strategy that incrementally degrades the quality of generated documents, progressively eliciting the model's reasoning ability by exposing it to increasingly challenging retrieval scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ZeroSearch effectively incentivizes the search capabilities of LLMs using a 3B LLM as the retrieval module. Remarkably, a 7B retrieval module achieves comparable performance to the real search engine, while a 14B retrieval module even surpasses it. Furthermore, it generalizes well across both base and instruction-tuned models of various parameter sizes and is compatible with a wide range of RL algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[ACE: A Security Architecture for LLM-Integrated App Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20984v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-integrated app systems extend the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) with third-party apps that are invoked by a system LLM using interleaved planning and execution phases to answer user queries. These systems introduce new attack vectors where malicious apps can cause integrity violation of planning or execution, availability breakdown, or privacy compromise during execution. In this work, we identify new attacks impacting the integrity of planning, as well as the integrity and availability of execution in LLM-integrated apps, and demonstrate them against IsolateGPT, a recent solution designed to mitigate attacks from malicious apps. We propose Abstract-Concrete-Execute (ACE), a new secure architecture for LLM-integrated app systems that provides security guarantees for system planning and execution. Specifically, ACE decouples planning into two phases by first creating an abstract execution plan using only trusted information, and then mapping the abstract plan to a concrete plan using installed system apps. We verify that the plans generated by our system satisfy user-specified secure information flow constraints via static analysis on the structured plan output. During execution, ACE enforces data and capability barriers between apps, and ensures that the execution is conducted according to the trusted abstract plan. We show experimentally that our system is secure against attacks from the INJECAGENT benchmark, a standard benchmark for control flow integrity in the face of indirect prompt injection attacks, and our newly introduced attacks. Our architecture represents a significant advancement towards hardening LLM-based systems containing system facilities of varying levels of trustworthiness.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 13 figures; clarify relation to indirect prompt injection attacks</p></details> |
| **[SlideItRight: Using AI to Find Relevant Slides and Provide Feedback for Open-Ended Questions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04584v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feedback is important in supporting student learning. While various automated feedback systems have been implemented to make the feedback scalable, many existing solutions only focus on generating text-based feedback. As is indicated in the multimedia learning principle, learning with more modalities could help utilize more separate channels, reduce the cognitive load and facilitate students' learning. Hence, it is important to explore the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in feedback generation from and to different modalities. Our study leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for textual feedback with the supplementary guidance from other modality - relevant lecture slide retrieved from the slides hub. Through an online crowdsourcing study (N=91), this study investigates learning gains and student perceptions using a 2x2 design (i.e., human feedback vs. AI feedback and with vs. without relevant slide), evaluating the clarity, engagement, perceived effectiveness, and reliability) of AI-facilitated multimodal feedback. We observed significant pre-to-post learning gains across all conditions. However, the differences in these gains were not statistically significant between conditions. The post-survey revealed that students found the slide feedback helpful in their learning process, though they reported difficulty in understanding it. Regarding the AI-generated open-ended feedback, students considered it personalized and relevant to their responses, but they expressed lower trust in the AI feedback compared to human-generated feedback.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, to be published at the 26th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED '25)</p></details> |
| **[Fight Fire with Fire: Defending Against Malicious RL Fine-Tuning via Reward Neutralization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04578v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning transforms large language models while creating a vulnerability we experimentally verify: Our experiment shows that malicious RL fine-tuning dismantles safety guardrails with remarkable efficiency, requiring only 50 steps and minimal adversarial prompts, with harmful escalating from 0-2 to 7-9. This attack vector particularly threatens open-source models with parameter-level access. Existing defenses targeting supervised fine-tuning prove ineffective against RL's dynamic feedback mechanisms. We introduce Reward Neutralization, the first defense framework specifically designed against RL fine-tuning attacks, establishing concise rejection patterns that render malicious reward signals ineffective. Our approach trains models to produce minimal-information rejections that attackers cannot exploit, systematically neutralizing attempts to optimize toward harmful outputs. Experiments validate that our approach maintains low harmful scores (no greater than 2) after 200 attack steps, while standard models rapidly deteriorate. This work provides the first constructive proof that robust defense against increasingly accessible RL attacks is achievable, addressing a critical security gap for open-weight models.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM2CLIP: Powerful Language Model Unlocks Richer Visual Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04997v4)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CLIP is a foundational multimodal model that aligns image and text features into a shared representation space via contrastive learning on large-scale image-text pairs. Its effectiveness primarily stems from the use of natural language as rich supervision. Motivated by the remarkable advancements in large language models (LLMs), this work explores how LLMs' superior text understanding and extensive open-world knowledge can enhance CLIP's capability, especially for processing longer and more complex image captions. We propose an efficient post-training strategy that integrates LLMs into pretrained CLIP. To address the challenge posed by the autoregressive nature of LLMs, we introduce a caption-to-caption contrastive fine-tuning framework, significantly enhancing the discriminative quality of LLM outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms LoRA-based methods, achieving nearly fourfold faster training with superior performance. Furthermore, we validate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art models such as CLIP, EVA02, and SigLip2 across various zero-shot multimodal retrieval tasks, cross-lingual retrieval tasks, and multimodal language model pretraining.</p></details> |  |
| **[An LLM-based Self-Evolving Security Framework for 6G Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03161v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently emerged 6G space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs), which integrate satellites, aerial networks, and terrestrial communications, offer ubiquitous coverage for various mobile applications. However, the highly dynamic, open, and heterogeneous nature of SAGINs poses severe security issues. Forming a defense line of SAGINs suffers from two preliminary challenges: 1) accurately understanding massive unstructured multi-dimensional threat information to generate defense strategies against various malicious attacks, 2) rapidly adapting to potential unknown threats to yield more effective security strategies. To tackle the above two challenges, we propose a novel security framework for SAGINs based on Large Language Models (LLMs), which consists of two key ingredients LLM-6GNG and 6G-INST. Our proposed LLM-6GNG leverages refined chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and dynamic multi-agent mechanisms to analyze massive unstructured multi-dimensional threat data and generate comprehensive security strategies, thus addressing the first challenge. Our proposed 6G-INST relies on a novel self-evolving method to automatically update LLM-6GNG, enabling it to accommodate unknown threats under dynamic communication environments, thereby addressing the second challenge. Additionally, we prototype the proposed framework with ns-3, OpenAirInterface (OAI), and software-defined radio (SDR). Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. The results show that our framework produces highly accurate security strategies that remain robust against a variety of unknown attacks. We will release our code to contribute to the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Communications Magazine</p></details> |
| **[High-Dimensional Interlingual Representations of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11280v3)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) trained on massive multilingual datasets hint at the formation of interlingual constructs--a shared subspace in the representation space. However, evidence regarding this phenomenon is mixed, leaving it unclear whether these models truly develop unified interlingual representations, or present a partially aligned constructs. We explore 31 diverse languages varying on their resource-levels, typologies, and geographical regions; and find that multilingual LLMs exhibit inconsistent cross-lingual alignments. To address this, we propose an interlingual representation framework identifying both the shared interlingual semantic subspace and fragmented components, existed due to representational limitations. We introduce Interlingual Local Overlap (ILO) score to quantify interlingual alignment by comparing the local neighborhood structures of high-dimensional representations. We utilize ILO to investigate the impact of single-language fine-tuning on the interlingual representations in multilingual LLMs. Our results indicate that training exclusively on a single language disrupts the alignment in early layers, while freezing these layers preserves the alignment of interlingual representations, leading to improved cross-lingual generalization. These results validate our framework and metric for evaluating interlingual representation, and further underscore that interlingual alignment is crucial for scalable multilingual learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comparative Analysis of Carbon Footprint in Manual vs. LLM-Assisted Code Development](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04521v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLM) have significantly transformed various domains, including software development. These models assist programmers in generating code, potentially increasing productivity and efficiency. However, the environmental impact of utilising these AI models is substantial, given their high energy consumption during both training and inference stages. This research aims to compare the energy consumption of manual software development versus an LLM-assisted approach, using Codeforces as a simulation platform for software development. The goal is to quantify the environmental impact and propose strategies for minimising the carbon footprint of using LLM in software development. Our results show that the LLM-assisted code generation leads on average to 32.72 higher carbon footprint than the manual one. Moreover, there is a significant correlation between task complexity and the difference in the carbon footprint of the two approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pangu Ultra MoE: How to Train Your Big MoE on Ascend NPUs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04519v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse large language models (LLMs) with Mixture of Experts (MoE) and close to a trillion parameters are dominating the realm of most capable language models. However, the massive model scale poses significant challenges for the underlying software and hardware systems. In this paper, we aim to uncover a recipe to harness such scale on Ascend NPUs. The key goals are better usage of the computing resources under the dynamic sparse model structures and materializing the expected performance gain on the actual hardware. To select model configurations suitable for Ascend NPUs without repeatedly running the expensive experiments, we leverage simulation to compare the trade-off of various model hyperparameters. This study led to Pangu Ultra MoE, a sparse LLM with 718 billion parameters, and we conducted experiments on the model to verify the simulation results. On the system side, we dig into Expert Parallelism to optimize the communication between NPU devices to reduce the synchronization overhead. We also optimize the memory efficiency within the devices to further reduce the parameter and activation management overhead. In the end, we achieve an MFU of 30.0% when training Pangu Ultra MoE, with performance comparable to that of DeepSeek R1, on 6K Ascend NPUs, and demonstrate that the Ascend system is capable of harnessing all the training stages of the state-of-the-art language models. Extensive experiments indicate that our recipe can lead to efficient training of large-scale sparse language models with MoE. We also study the behaviors of such models for future reference.</p></details> |  |

To tackle the substantial challenge of addressing hallucinations for LLM-based ontology matching (OM) systems, we introduce a new benchmark dataset called OAEI-LLM-T. The dataset evolves from the TBox (i.e. schema-matching) datasets in the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI), capturing hallucinations of different LLMs performing OM tasks. These OM-specific hallucinations are carefully classified into two primary categories and six sub-categories. We showcase the usefulness of the dataset in constructing the LLM leaderboard and fine-tuning foundational LLMs for LLM-based OM systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables, 2 prompt templates</p></details> |
| **[CAD-Llama: Leveraging Large Language Models for Computer-Aided Design Parametric 3D Model Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04481v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant success, prompting increased interest in expanding their generative capabilities beyond general text into domain-specific areas. This study investigates the generation of parametric sequences for computer-aided design (CAD) models using LLMs. This endeavor represents an initial step towards creating parametric 3D shapes with LLMs, as CAD model parameters directly correlate with shapes in three-dimensional space. Despite the formidable generative capacities of LLMs, this task remains challenging, as these models neither encounter parametric sequences during their pretraining phase nor possess direct awareness of 3D structures. To address this, we present CAD-Llama, a framework designed to enhance pretrained LLMs for generating parametric 3D CAD models. Specifically, we develop a hierarchical annotation pipeline and a code-like format to translate parametric 3D CAD command sequences into Structured Parametric CAD Code (SPCC), incorporating hierarchical semantic descriptions. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive pretraining approach utilizing SPCC, followed by an instruction tuning process aligned with CAD-specific guidelines. This methodology aims to equip LLMs with the spatial knowledge inherent in parametric sequences. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms prior autoregressive methods and existing LLM baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrajEvo: Designing Trajectory Prediction Heuristics via LLM-driven Evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04480v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a crucial task in modeling human behavior, especially in fields as social robotics and autonomous vehicle navigation. Traditional heuristics based on handcrafted rules often lack accuracy, while recently proposed deep learning approaches suffer from computational cost, lack of explainability, and generalization issues that limit their practical adoption. In this paper, we introduce TrajEvo, a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design trajectory prediction heuristics. TrajEvo employs an evolutionary algorithm to generate and refine prediction heuristics from past trajectory data. We introduce a Cross-Generation Elite Sampling to promote population diversity and a Statistics Feedback Loop allowing the LLM to analyze alternative predictions. Our evaluations show TrajEvo outperforms previous heuristic methods on the ETH-UCY datasets, and remarkably outperforms both heuristics and deep learning methods when generalizing to the unseen SDD dataset. TrajEvo represents a first step toward automated design of fast, explainable, and generalizable trajectory prediction heuristics. We make our source code publicly available to foster future research at https://github.com/ai4co/trajevo.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces Miipher-2, an SR model designed for million-hour scale data, for training data cleaning for large-scale generative models like large language models. Key challenges addressed include generalization to unseen languages, operation without explicit conditioning (e.g., text, speaker ID), and computational efficiency. Miipher-2 utilizes a frozen, pre-trained Universal Speech Model (USM), supporting over 300 languages, as a robust, conditioning-free feature extractor. To optimize efficiency and minimize memory, Miipher-2 incorporates parallel adapters for predicting clean USM features from noisy inputs and employs the WaneFit neural vocoder for waveform synthesis. These components were trained on 3,000 hours of multi-lingual, studio-quality recordings with augmented degradations, while USM parameters remained fixed. Experimental results demonstrate Miipher-2's superior or comparable performance to conventional SR models in word-error-rate, speaker similarity, and both objective and subjective sound quality scores across all tested languages. Miipher-2 operates efficiently on consumer-grade accelerators, achieving a real-time factor of 0.0078, enabling the processing of a million-hour speech dataset in approximately three days using only 100 such accelerators.</p></details> |  |

Such models are trained on massive datasets comprising billions of public image-text pairs with diverse tasks. However, their performance on task-specific domains, such as radiology, is still under-investigated and potentially limited due to a lack of sophistication in understanding biomedical images. On the other hand, conversational medical models have exhibited remarkable success but have mainly focused on text-based analysis. In this paper, we introduce XrayGPT, a novel conversational medical vision-language model that can analyze and answer open-ended questions about chest radiographs. Specifically, we align both medical visual encoder (MedClip) with a fine-tuned large language model (Vicuna), using a simple linear transformation. This alignment enables our model to possess exceptional visual conversation abilities, grounded in a deep understanding of radiographs and medical domain knowledge. To enhance the performance of LLMs in the medical context, we generate ~217k interactive and high-quality summaries from free-text radiology reports. These summaries serve to enhance the performance of LLMs through the fine-tuning process. Our approach opens up new avenues the research for advancing the automated analysis of chest radiographs.

While Transformer-based methods struggle with quadratic computational complexity, recent Mamba-based models improve efficiency but fail to capture periodic user behaviors, leverage rich semantic information, or effectively fuse multimodal features. To address these challenges, we propose \model, a novel sequential recommendation framework that integrates multi-scale Mamba with Fourier analysis, Large Language Models (LLMs), and adaptive gating. First, we enhance Mamba with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to explicitly model periodic patterns in the frequency domain, separating meaningful trends from noise. Second, we incorporate LLM-based text embeddings to enrich sparse interaction data with semantic context from item descriptions. Finally, we introduce a learnable gate mechanism to dynamically balance temporal (Mamba), frequency (FFT), and semantic (LLM) features, ensuring harmonious multimodal fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \model\ achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Hit Rate@10 by 3.2\% over existing Mamba-based models while maintaining 20\% faster inference than Transformer baselines. Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining frequency analysis, semantic understanding, and adaptive fusion for sequential recommendation.

However, most approaches to LLM-based APR are limited to the static analysis of the programs, while disregarding their runtime behavior. Inspired by knowledge-augmented NLP, in this work, we aim to remedy this potential blind spot by augmenting standard APR prompts with program execution traces. We evaluate our approach using the GPT family of models on three popular APR datasets. Our findings suggest that simply incorporating execution traces into the prompt provides a limited performance improvement over trace-free baselines, in only 2 out of 6 tested dataset / model configurations. We further find that the effectiveness of execution traces for APR diminishes as their complexity increases. We explore several strategies for leveraging traces in prompts and demonstrate that LLM-optimized prompts help outperform trace-free prompts more consistently. Additionally, we show trace-based prompting to be superior to finetuning a smaller LLM on a small-scale dataset; and conduct probing studies reinforcing the notion that execution traces can complement the reasoning abilities of the LLMs.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose OBLIVIATE, a robust unlearning framework that removes targeted data while preserving model utility. The framework follows a structured process: extracting target tokens, building retain sets, and fine-tuning with a tailored loss function comprising three components -- masking, distillation, and world fact. Using low-rank adapters (LoRA), it ensures efficiency without compromising unlearning quality. We conduct experiments on multiple datasets, including the Harry Potter series, WMDP, and TOFU, using a comprehensive suite of metrics: forget quality (new document-level memorization score), model utility, and fluency. Results demonstrate its effectiveness in resisting membership inference attacks, minimizing the impact on retained data, and maintaining robustness across diverse scenarios.</p></details> | 18 pages, 2 figures |

Typically, the performance of LLMs is measured on benchmarks with small or medium-sized context windows of thousands of lines of code. At the same time, in real-world software projects, repositories can span up to millions of LoC. This paper closes this gap by contributing to the long context code generation benchmark (YABLoCo). The benchmark featured a test set of 215 functions selected from four large repositories with thousands of functions. The dataset contained metadata of functions, contexts of the functions with different levels of dependencies, docstrings, functions bodies, and call graphs for each repository. This paper presents three key aspects of the contribution. First, the benchmark aims at function body generation in large repositories in C and C++, two languages not covered by previous benchmarks. Second, the benchmark contains large repositories from 200K to 2,000K LoC. Third, we contribute a scalable evaluation pipeline for efficient computing of the target metrics and a tool for visual analysis of generated code. Overall, these three aspects allow for evaluating code generation in large repositories in C and C++.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at LLM4Code 2025 Workshop co-located wtih ICSE 2025</p></details> |

However, the current community suffers from a lack of large-scale datasets with intensive, descriptive emotion annotations, as well as a multimodal-centric framework to maximize the potential of MLLMs for emotion understanding. To address this, we establish a new benchmark for MLLM-based emotion understanding with a novel dataset (MER-Caption) and a new model (AffectGPT). Utilizing our model-based crowd-sourcing data collection strategy, we construct the largest descriptive emotion dataset to date (by far), featuring over 2K fine-grained emotion categories across 115K samples. We also introduce the AffectGPT model, designed with pre-fusion operations to enhance multimodal integration. Finally, we present MER-UniBench, a unified benchmark with evaluation metrics tailored for typical MER tasks and the free-form, natural language output style of MLLMs. Extensive experimental results show AffectGPT's robust performance across various MER tasks. We have released both the code and the dataset to advance research and development in emotion understanding: https://github.com/zeroQiaoba/AffectGPT.</p></details> |  |

Large language models (LLMs) are predominantly used by many as a primary source of information for various topics. LLMs frequently make factual errors, fabricate data (hallucinations), or present biases, exposing users to misinformation and influencing opinions. Educating users on their risks is key to responsible use, as bias, unlike hallucinations, cannot be caught through data verification. We quantify the political bias of popular LLMs in the context of the recent vote of the German Bundestag using the score produced by the Wahl-O-Mat. This metric measures the alignment between an individual's political views and the positions of German political parties. We compare the models' alignment scores to identify factors influencing their political preferences. Doing so, we discover a bias toward left-leaning parties, most dominant in larger LLMs. Also, we find that the language we use to communicate with the models affects their political views. Additionally, we analyze the influence of a model's origin and release date and compare the results to the outcome of the recent vote of the Bundestag. Our results imply that LLMs are prone to exhibiting political bias. Large corporations with the necessary means to develop LLMs, thus, knowingly or unknowingly, have a responsibility to contain these biases, as they can influence each voter's decision-making process and inform public opinion in general and at scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimating LLM Uncertainty with Logits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00290v4)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past few years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have developed rapidly and are widely applied in various domains. However, LLMs face the issue of hallucinations, generating responses that may be unreliable when the models lack relevant knowledge. To be aware of potential hallucinations, uncertainty estimation methods have been introduced, and most of them have confirmed that reliability lies in critical tokens. However, probability-based methods perform poorly in identifying token reliability, limiting their practical utility. In this paper, we reveal that the probability-based method fails to estimate token reliability due to the loss of evidence strength information which is accumulated in the training stage. Therefore, we present Logits-induced token uncertainty (LogTokU), a framework for estimating decoupled token uncertainty in LLMs, enabling real-time uncertainty estimation without requiring multiple sampling processes. We employ evidence modeling to implement LogTokU and use the estimated uncertainty to guide downstream tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that LogTokU has significant effectiveness and promise.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fixed...</summary><p>Fixed some data errors in Table 1</p></details> |

Recent RLVR works that operate under the zero setting avoid supervision in labeling the reasoning process, but still depend on manually curated collections of questions and answers for training. The scarcity of high-quality, human-produced examples raises concerns about the long-term scalability of relying on human supervision, a challenge already evident in the domain of language model pretraining. Furthermore, in a hypothetical future where AI surpasses human intelligence, tasks provided by humans may offer limited learning potential for a superintelligent system. To address these concerns, we propose a new RLVR paradigm called Absolute Zero, in which a single model learns to propose tasks that maximize its own learning progress and improves reasoning by solving them, without relying on any external data. Under this paradigm, we introduce the Absolute Zero Reasoner (AZR), a system that self-evolves its training curriculum and reasoning ability by using a code executor to both validate proposed code reasoning tasks and verify answers, serving as an unified source of verifiable reward to guide open-ended yet grounded learning. Despite being trained entirely without external data, AZR achieves overall SOTA performance on coding and mathematical reasoning tasks, outperforming existing zero-setting models that rely on tens of thousands of in-domain human-curated examples. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AZR can be effectively applied across different model scales and is compatible with various model classes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking the Lens of the Telescope: Online Relevance Estimation over Large Retrieval Sets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09353v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced relevance models, such as those that use large language models (LLMs), provide highly accurate relevance estimations. However, their computational costs make them infeasible for processing large document corpora. To address this, retrieval systems often employ a telescoping approach, where computationally efficient but less precise lexical and semantic retrievers filter potential candidates for further ranking. However, this approach heavily depends on the quality of early-stage retrieval, which can potentially exclude relevant documents early in the process. In this work, we propose a novel paradigm for re-ranking called online relevance estimation that continuously updates relevance estimates for a query throughout the ranking process. Instead of re-ranking a fixed set of top-k documents in a single step, online relevance estimation iteratively re-scores smaller subsets of the most promising documents while adjusting relevance scores for the remaining pool based on the estimations from the final model using an online bandit-based algorithm. This dynamic process mitigates the recall limitations of telescoping systems by re-prioritizing documents initially deemed less relevant by earlier stages -- including those completely excluded by earlier-stage retrievers. We validate our approach on TREC benchmarks under two scenarios: hybrid retrieval and adaptive retrieval. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is sample-efficient and significantly improves recall, highlighting the effectiveness of our online relevance estimation framework for modern search systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at SIGIR'25 . 11 pages,5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Playing repeated games with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16867v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs are increasingly used in applications where they interact with humans and other agents. We propose to use behavioural game theory to study LLM's cooperation and coordination behaviour. We let different LLMs play finitely repeated $2\times2$ games with each other, with human-like strategies, and actual human players. Our results show that LLMs perform particularly well at self-interested games like the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma family. However, they behave sub-optimally in games that require coordination, like the Battle of the Sexes. We verify that these behavioural signatures are stable across robustness checks. We additionally show how GPT-4's behaviour can be modulated by providing additional information about its opponent and by using a "social chain-of-thought" (SCoT) strategy. This also leads to better scores and more successful coordination when interacting with human players. These results enrich our understanding of LLM's social behaviour and pave the way for a behavioural game theory for machines.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-based Bi-level Multi-interest Learning Framework for Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09410v3)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation (SR) leverages users' dynamic preferences, with recent advances incorporating multi-interest learning to model diverse user interests. However, most multi-interest SR models rely on noisy, sparse implicit feedback, limiting recommendation accuracy. Large language models (LLMs) offer robust reasoning on low-quality data but face high computational costs and latency challenges for SR integration. We propose a novel LLM-based multi-interest SR framework combining implicit behavioral and explicit semantic perspectives. It includes two modules: the Implicit Behavioral Interest Module (IBIM), which learns from user behavior using a traditional SR model, and the Explicit Semantic Interest Module (ESIM), which uses clustering and prompt-engineered LLMs to extract semantic multi-interest representations from informative samples. Semantic insights from ESIM enhance IBIM's behavioral representations via modality alignment and semantic prediction tasks. During inference, only IBIM is used, ensuring efficient, LLM-free recommendations. Experiments on four real-world datasets validate the framework's effectiveness and practicality.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods often falter when standardizing CDEs of varying representation and complex structure, impeding data integration and interoperability in clinical research. We introduce CDE-Mapper, an innovative framework that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation approach combined with Large Language Models to automate the linking of CDEs to controlled vocabularies. Our modular approach features query decomposition to manage varying levels of CDEs complexity, integrates expert-defined rules within prompt engineering, and employs in-context learning alongside multiple retriever components to resolve terminological ambiguities. In addition, we propose a knowledge reservoir validated by a human-in-loop approach, achieving accurate concept linking for future applications while minimizing computational costs. For four diverse datasets, CDE-Mapper achieved an average of 7.2\% higher accuracy improvement compared to baseline methods. This work highlights the potential of advanced language models in improving data harmonization and significantly advancing capabilities in clinical decision support systems and research.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages (one column), 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Benchmarking LLMs' Swarm intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04364v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential for complex reasoning, yet their capacity for emergent coordination in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) when operating under strict constraints-such as limited local perception and communication, characteristic of natural swarms-remains largely unexplored, particularly concerning the nuances of swarm intelligence. Existing benchmarks often do not fully capture the unique challenges of decentralized coordination that arise when agents operate with incomplete spatio-temporal information. To bridge this gap, we introduce SwarmBench, a novel benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the swarm intelligence capabilities of LLMs acting as decentralized agents. SwarmBench features five foundational MAS coordination tasks within a configurable 2D grid environment, forcing agents to rely primarily on local sensory input (k x k view) and local communication. We propose metrics for coordination effectiveness and analyze emergent group dynamics. Evaluating several leading LLMs in a zero-shot setting, we find significant performance variations across tasks, highlighting the difficulties posed by local information constraints. While some coordination emerges, results indicate limitations in robust planning and strategy formation under uncertainty in these decentralized scenarios. Assessing LLMs under swarm-like conditions is crucial for realizing their potential in future decentralized systems. We release SwarmBench as an open, extensible toolkit-built upon a customizable and scalable physical system with defined mechanical properties. It provides environments, prompts, evaluation scripts, and the comprehensive experimental datasets generated, aiming to foster reproducible research into LLM-based MAS coordination and the theoretical underpinnings of Embodied MAS.

However, the issues of variability and reproducibility of results from each trial of LLMs have been largely overlooked in existing literature while actual human annotation uses majority voting to resolve disagreements among annotators. Therefore, this study introduces the straightforward ensemble strategy to a sentiment analysis using LLMs. As the results, we demonstrate that the ensemble of multiple inference using medium-sized LLMs produces more robust and accurate results than using a large model with a single attempt with reducing RMSE by 18.6%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been accepted for the 30th International Conference on Natural Language \& Information Systems (NLDB 2025) and will appear in Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)</p></details> |

Mitigating the Hallucination for Path Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13184v3)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) is the foundation for embodied intelligence. However, even in simple maze environments, LLMs still encounter challenges in long-term path-planning, primarily influenced by their spatial hallucination and context inconsistency hallucination by long-term reasoning. To address this challenge, this study proposes an innovative model, Spatial-to-Relational Transformation and Curriculum Q-Learning (S2RCQL). To address the spatial hallucination of LLMs, we propose the Spatial-to-Relational approach, which transforms spatial prompts into entity relations and paths representing entity relation chains. This approach fully taps the potential of LLMs in terms of sequential thinking. As a result, we design a path-planning algorithm based on Q-learning to mitigate the context inconsistency hallucination, which enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs. Using the Q-value of state-action as auxiliary information for prompts, we correct the hallucinations of LLMs, thereby guiding LLMs to learn the optimal path. Finally, we propose a reverse curriculum learning technique based on LLMs to further mitigate the context inconsistency hallucination. LLMs can rapidly accumulate successful experiences by reducing task difficulty and leveraging them to tackle more complex tasks. We performed comprehensive experiments based on Baidu's self-developed LLM: ERNIE-Bot 4.0. The results showed that our S2RCQL achieved a 23%--40% improvement in both success and optimality rates compared with advanced prompt engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICIC 2025</p></details> |
| **[EEmo-Bench: A Benchmark for Multi-modal Large Language Models on Image Evoked Emotion Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16405v3)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The furnishing of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has led to the emergence of numerous benchmark studies, particularly those evaluating their perception and understanding capabilities. Among these, understanding image-evoked emotions aims to enhance MLLMs' empathy, with significant applications such as human-machine interaction and advertising recommendations. However, current evaluations of this MLLM capability remain coarse-grained, and a systematic and comprehensive assessment is still lacking. To this end, we introduce EEmo-Bench, a novel benchmark dedicated to the analysis of the evoked emotions in images across diverse content categories. Our core contributions include: 1) Regarding the diversity of the evoked emotions, we adopt an emotion ranking strategy and employ the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) as emotional attributes for emotional assessment. In line with this methodology, 1,960 images are collected and manually annotated. 2) We design four tasks to evaluate MLLMs' ability to capture the evoked emotions by single images and their associated attributes: Perception, Ranking, Description, and Assessment. Additionally, image-pairwise analysis is introduced to investigate the model's proficiency in performing joint and comparative analysis. In total, we collect 6,773 question-answer pairs and perform a thorough assessment on 19 commonly-used MLLMs. The results indicate that while some proprietary and large-scale open-source MLLMs achieve promising overall performance, the analytical capabilities in certain evaluation dimensions remain suboptimal. Our EEmo-Bench paves the path for further research aimed at enhancing the comprehensive perceiving and understanding capabilities of MLLMs concerning image-evoked emotions, which is crucial for machine-centric emotion perception and understanding.</p></details> |  |

While the volume and complexity of pharmacovigilance data have increased, existing research in this field has predominantly focused on general diseases rather than specifically addressing cancer. This work introduces the task of grouped summarization of adverse drug events reported by multiple patients using the same drug for cancer treatment. To address the challenge of limited resources in cancer pharmacovigilance, we present the MultiLabeled Cancer Adverse Drug Reaction and Summarization (MCADRS) dataset. This dataset includes pharmacovigilance posts detailing patient concerns regarding drug efficacy and adverse effects, along with extracted labels for drug names, adverse drug events, severity, and adversity of reactions, as well as summaries of ADEs for each drug. Additionally, we propose the Grouping and Abstractive Summarization of Cancer Adverse Drug events (GASCADE) framework, a novel pipeline that combines the information extraction capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the summarization power of the encoder-decoder T5 model. Our work is the first to apply alignment techniques, including advanced algorithms like Direct Preference Optimization, to encoder-decoder models using synthetic datasets for summarization tasks. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance of GASCADE across various metrics, validated through both automated assessments and human evaluations. This multitasking approach enhances drug-related decision-making and fosters a deeper understanding of patient concerns, paving the way for advancements in personalized and responsive cancer care. The code and dataset used in this work are publicly available.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Cue Learning using Evolution for Accurate Recognition (CLEAR), which uses a combination of LLMs and evolutionary computation to generate and optimize cues such that recognition of specialized features in images is improved. It achieves this by auto-generating a novel domain-specific representation and then using it to optimize suitable textual cues with a genetic algorithm. We apply CLEAR to the real-world task of identifying sustainability data from interior and exterior images of buildings. We investigate the effects of using a variable-length representation compared to fixed-length and show how LLM consistency can be improved by refactoring from categorical to real-valued estimates. We show that CLEAR enables higher accuracy compared to expert human recognition and human-authored prompts in every task with error rates improved by up to two orders of magnitude and an ablation study evincing solution concision.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages plus 2 pages of supplemental material</p></details> |

Despite their impressive adaptability, these models remain vulnerable to subtle adversarial perturbations and exhibit unpredictable behavior when faced with linguistic variations. Inspired by software testing principles, we introduce a software testing-inspired framework, called MMT4NL, for evaluating the trustworthiness of in-context learning by utilizing adversarial perturbations and software testing techniques. It includes diverse evaluation aspects of linguistic capabilities for testing the ICL capabilities of LLMs. MMT4NL is built around the idea of crafting metamorphic adversarial examples from a test set in order to quantify and pinpoint bugs in the designed prompts of ICL. Our philosophy is to treat any LLM as software and validate its functionalities just like testing the software. Finally, we demonstrate applications of MMT4NL on the sentiment analysis and question-answering tasks. Our experiments could reveal various linguistic bugs in state-of-the-art LLMs.</p></details> |  |

In this regard, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a highly promising tool for defensive and offensive cybersecurity-related strategies. While existing literature has focused much on the defensive use of LLMs, when it comes to their offensive utilization, very little has been reported-namely, concerning Vulnerability Assessment (VA) report validation. Consequentially, this paper tries to fill that gap by investigating the capabilities of LLMs in automating and improving the validation process of the report of the VA. From the critical review of the related literature, this paper hereby proposes a new approach to using the LLMs in the automation of the analysis and within the validation process of the report of the VA that could potentially reduce the number of false positives and generally enhance efficiency. These results are promising for LLM automatization for improving validation on reports coming from VA in order to improve accuracy while reducing human effort and security postures. The contribution of this paper provides further evidence about the offensive and defensive LLM capabilities and therefor helps in devising more appropriate cybersecurity strategies and tools accordingly.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-p...</summary><p>Pre-print - Accepted for publication in the Proceedings of the International Computer Sciences and Informatics Conference (ICSIC-2024), published by AIP Publishing</p></details> |

However, untrained lay users have poor prompt specification abilities and often struggle with conveying their latent preferences to AI assistants. To address this, we leverage activation steering to guide LLMs to align with interpretable preference dimensions during inference. In contrast to memory-based personalization methods that require longer user history, steering is extremely lightweight and can be easily controlled by the user via an linear strength factor. We embed steering into three different interactive chatbot interfaces and conduct a within-subjects user study (n=14) to investigate how end users prefer to personalize their conversations. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of preference-based steering for aligning real-world conversations with hidden user preferences, and highlight further insights on how diverse values around control, usability, and transparency lead users to prefer different interfaces.</p></details> |  |

However, existing HBD architectures face fundamental limitations in scalability, cost, and fault resiliency: switch-centric HBDs (e.g., NVL-72) incur prohibitive scaling costs, while GPU-centric HBDs (e.g., TPUv3/Dojo) suffer from severe fault propagation. Switch-GPU hybrid HBDs such as TPUv4 takes a middle-ground approach by leveraging Optical Circuit Switches, but the fault explosion radius remains large at the cube level (e.g., 64 TPUs). We propose InfiniteHBD, a novel transceiver-centric HBD architecture that unifies connectivity and dynamic switching at the transceiver level using Optical Circuit Switching (OCS). By embedding OCS within each transceiver, InfiniteHBD achieves reconfigurable point-to-multipoint connectivity, allowing the topology to adapt into variable-size rings. This design provides: i) datacenter-wide scalability without cost explosion; ii) fault resilience by isolating failures to a single node, and iii) full bandwidth utilization for fault-free GPUs. Key innovations include a Silicon Photonic (SiPh) based low-cost OCS transceiver (OCSTrx), a reconfigurable k-hop ring topology co-designed with intra-/inter-node communication, and an HBD-DCN orchestration algorithm maximizing GPU utilization while minimizing cross-ToR datacenter network traffic. The evaluation demonstrates that InfiniteHBD achieves 31% of the cost of NVL-72, near-zero GPU waste ratio (over one order of magnitude lower than NVL-72 and TPUv4), near-zero cross-ToR traffic when node fault ratios under 7%, and improves Model FLOPs Utilization by 3.37x compared to NVIDIA DGX (8 GPUs per Node).</p></details> |  |
| **[Fate: Fast Edge Inference of Mixture-of-Experts Models via Cross-Layer Gate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12224v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various tasks, and their application in edge scenarios has attracted significant attention. However, sparse-activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, which are well suited for edge scenarios, have received relatively little attention due to their high memory demands. Offload-based methods have been proposed to address this challenge, but they face difficulties with expert prediction. Inaccurate expert predictions can result in prolonged inference delays. To promote the application of MoE models in edge scenarios, we propose Fate, an offloading system designed for MoE models to enable efficient inference in resource-constrained environments. The key insight behind Fate is that gate inputs from adjacent layers can be effectively used for expert prefetching, achieving high prediction accuracy without additional GPU overhead. Furthermore, Fate employs a shallow-favoring expert caching strategy that increases the expert hit rate to 99\%. Additionally, Fate integrates tailored quantization strategies for cache optimization and IO efficiency. Experimental results show that, compared to Load on Demand and Expert Activation Path-based method, Fate achieves up to 4.5x and 1.9x speedups in prefill speed and up to 4.1x and 2.2x speedups in decoding speed, respectively, while maintaining inference quality. Moreover, Fate's performance improvements are scalable across different memory budgets.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Large Language Model for Feasible and Diverse Population Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04196v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating a synthetic population that is both feasible and diverse is crucial for ensuring the validity of downstream activity schedule simulation in activity-based models (ABMs). While deep generative models (DGMs), such as variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks, have been applied to this task, they often struggle to balance the inclusion of rare but plausible combinations (i.e., sampling zeros) with the exclusion of implausible ones (i.e., structural zeros). To improve feasibility while maintaining diversity, we propose a fine-tuning method for large language models (LLMs) that explicitly controls the autoregressive generation process through topological orderings derived from a Bayesian Network (BN). Experimental results show that our hybrid LLM-BN approach outperforms both traditional DGMs and proprietary LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT-4o) with few-shot learning. Specifically, our approach achieves approximately 95% feasibility, significantly higher than the ~80% observed in DGMs, while maintaining comparable diversity, making it well-suited for practical applications. Importantly, the method is based on a lightweight open-source LLM, enabling fine-tuning and inference on standard personal computing environments. This makes the approach cost-effective and scalable for large-scale applications, such as synthesizing populations in megacities, without relying on expensive infrastructure. By initiating the ABM pipeline with high-quality synthetic populations, our method improves overall simulation reliability and reduces downstream error propagation. The source code for these methods is available for research and practical application.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables.

However, their knowledge is limited to a fixed cutoff date, making them prone to generating code vulnerable to newly disclosed CVEs. Frequent fine-tuning with new CVE sets is costly, and existing LLM-based approaches focus on oversimplified CWE examples and require providing explicit bug locations to LLMs, limiting their ability to patch complex real-world vulnerabilities. To address these limitations, we propose AutoPatch, a multi-agent framework designed to patch vulnerable LLM-generated code, particularly those introduced after the LLMs' knowledge cutoff. AutoPatch integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a structured database of recently disclosed vulnerabilities, comprising 525 code snippets derived from 75 high-severity CVEs across real-world systems such as the Linux kernel and Chrome. AutoPatch combines semantic and taint analysis to identify the most relevant CVE and leverages enhanced Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to construct enriched prompts for verification and patching. Our unified similarity model, which selects the most relevant vulnerabilities, achieves 90.4 percent accuracy in CVE matching. AutoPatch attains 89.5 percent F1-score for vulnerability verification and 95.0 percent accuracy in patching, while being over 50x more cost-efficient than traditional fine-tuning approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, single column, 7 figures.

Despite their demonstrated efficiency and performance, pretraining such non-standard architectures from scratch remains costly and risky. The linearization of large language models (LLMs) transforms pretrained standard models into linear recurrent structures, enabling more efficient deployment. However, current linearization methods typically introduce additional feature map modules that require extensive fine-tuning and overlook the gating mechanisms used in state-of-the-art linear recurrent models. To address these issues, this paper presents Liger, short for Linearizing LLMs to gated recurrent structures. Liger is a novel approach for converting pretrained LLMs into gated linear recurrent models without adding extra parameters. It repurposes the pretrained key matrix weights to construct diverse gating mechanisms, facilitating the formation of various gated recurrent structures while avoiding the need to train additional components from scratch. Using lightweight fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Liger restores the performance of the linearized gated recurrent models to match that of the original LLMs. Additionally, we introduce Liger Attention, an intra-layer hybrid attention mechanism, which significantly recovers 93\% of the Transformer-based LLM at 0.02\% pre-training tokens during the linearization process, achieving competitive results across multiple benchmarks, as validated on models ranging from 1B to 8B parameters.

Analyzing the sentiment expressed in these online discussions can offer valuable insights into public perception, inform policy decisions, and enhance emergency responses. Although sentiment analysis has been widely studied in various fields, its specific application to climate-induced events, particularly in real-time, high-impact situations like the 2025 Los Angeles forest fires, remains underexplored. In this survey, we thoroughly examine the methods, datasets, challenges, and ethical considerations related to sentiment analysis of social media content concerning weather and climate change events. We present a detailed taxonomy of approaches, ranging from lexicon-based and machine learning models to the latest strategies driven by large language models (LLMs). Additionally, we discuss data collection and annotation techniques, including weak supervision and real-time event tracking. Finally, we highlight several open problems, such as misinformation detection, multimodal sentiment extraction, and model alignment with human values. Our goal is to guide researchers and practitioners in effectively understanding sentiment during the climate crisis era.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 Pa...</summary><p>13 Pages, 1 figure, Under review for a computer science conference</p></details> |

Such a human-in-the-loop radiology assistant could facilitate a collaborative diagnostic process, thus saving time and improving the quality of reports. Towards this goal, we introduce RaDialog, the first thoroughly evaluated and publicly available large vision-language model for radiology report generation and interactive dialog. RaDialog effectively integrates visual image features and structured pathology findings with a large language model (LLM) while simultaneously adapting it to a specialized domain using parameter-efficient fine-tuning. To keep the conversational abilities of the underlying LLM, we propose a comprehensive, semi-automatically labeled, image-grounded instruct dataset for chest X-ray radiology tasks. By training with this dataset, our method achieves state-of-the-art clinical correctness in report generation and shows impressive abilities in interactive tasks such as correcting reports and answering questions, serving as a foundational step toward clinical dialog systems.

Conventional threshold-based or heuristic schemes often fail, leading to either sticky or excessive handovers. We introduce the first cross-layer use of an on-device large language model (LLM): high-level reasoning in the application layer that issues real-time actions executed in the PHY/MAC stack. The LLM addresses two tasks: (i) context-aware AP selection, where structured prompts fuse environmental cues (e.g., location, time) to choose the best BSSID; and (ii) dynamic threshold adjustment, where the model adaptively decides when to roam. To satisfy the tight latency and resource budgets of edge hardware, we apply a suite of optimizations-chain-of-thought prompting, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and quantization. Experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets show that our approach surpasses legacy heuristics and DRL baselines, achieving a strong balance between roaming stability and signal quality. These findings underscore the promise of application-layer LLM reasoning for lower-layer wireless control in future edge systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models are often politically extreme, usually ideologically inconsistent, and persuasive even in informational contexts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04171v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are a transformational technology, fundamentally changing how people obtain information and interact with the world. As people become increasingly reliant on them for an enormous variety of tasks, a body of academic research has developed to examine these models for inherent biases, especially political biases, often finding them small. We challenge this prevailing wisdom. First, by comparing 31 LLMs to legislators, judges, and a nationally representative sample of U.S. voters, we show that LLMs' apparently small overall partisan preference is the net result of offsetting extreme views on specific topics, much like moderate voters. Second, in a randomized experiment, we show that LLMs can promulgate their preferences into political persuasiveness even in information-seeking contexts: voters randomized to discuss political issues with an LLM chatbot are as much as 5 percentage points more likely to express the same preferences as that chatbot. Contrary to expectations, these persuasive effects are not moderated by familiarity with LLMs, news consumption, or interest in politics. LLMs, especially those controlled by private companies or governments, may become a powerful and targeted vector for political influence.</p></details> | 61 pages, 29 figures |
| **[Can Language Models Understand Social Behavior in Clinical Conversations?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04152v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective communication between providers and their patients influences health and care outcomes. The effectiveness of such conversations has been linked not only to the exchange of clinical information, but also to a range of interpersonal behaviors; commonly referred to as social signals, which are often conveyed through non-verbal cues and shape the quality of the patient-provider relationship. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated an increasing ability to infer emotional and social behaviors even when analyzing only textual information. As automation increases also in clinical settings, such as for transcription of patient-provider conversations, there is growing potential for LLMs to automatically analyze and extract social behaviors from these interactions. To explore the foundational capabilities of LLMs in tracking social signals in clinical dialogue, we designed task-specific prompts and evaluated model performance across multiple architectures and prompting styles using a highly imbalanced, annotated dataset spanning 20 distinct social signals such as provider dominance, patient warmth, etc. We present the first system capable of tracking all these 20 coded signals, and uncover patterns in LLM behavior. Further analysis of model configurations and clinical context provides insights for enhancing LLM performance on social signal processing tasks in healthcare settings.</p></details> |  |

Through preliminary testing on platforms such as ChatGPT, MetaAI, and Grok, we observed that even short, natural prompts could lead to the generation of compromising images ranging from realistic depictions of forged documents to manipulated images of public figures. We introduce Unmasking the Canvas (UTC Benchmark; UTCB), a dynamic and scalable benchmark dataset to evaluate LLM vulnerability in image generation. Our methodology combines structured prompt engineering, multilingual obfuscation (e.g., Zulu, Gaelic, Base64), and evaluation using Groq-hosted LLaMA-3. The pipeline supports both zero-shot and fallback prompting strategies, risk scoring, and automated tagging. All generations are stored with rich metadata and curated into Bronze (non-verified), Silver (LLM-aided verification), and Gold (manually verified) tiers. UTCB is designed to evolve over time with new data sources, prompt templates, and model behaviors. Warning: This paper includes visual examples of adversarial inputs designed to test model safety.

However, these methods fail when all pathways to the goal are blocked. In such cases, the robot must reason about how to reconfigure the environment to access task-relevant regions - a problem known as Navigation Among Movable Objects (NAMO). While various solutions to this problem have been developed, they often struggle to scale to highly cluttered environments. To address this, we propose NAMO-LLM, a sampling-based planner that searches over robot and obstacle configurations to compute feasible plans specifying which obstacles to move, where, and in what order. Its key novelty is a non-uniform sampling strategy guided by Large Language Models (LLMs) biasing the tree construction toward directions more likely to yield a solution. We show that NAMO-LLM is probabilistically complete and demonstrate through experiments that it efficiently scales to cluttered environments, outperforming related works in both runtime and plan quality.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely available and have demonstrated intelligent behaviors in various benchmarks with natural conversation skills. However, their ability to replicate human color-word associations remains understudied. We compared multiple generations of LLMs (from GPT-3 to GPT-4o) against human color-word associations using data collected from over 10,000 Japanese participants, involving 17 colors and 80 words (10 word from eight categories) in Japanese. Our findings reveal a clear progression in LLM performance across generations, with GPT-4o achieving the highest accuracy in predicting the best voted word for each color and category. However, the highest median performance was approximately 50% even for GPT-4o with visual inputs (chance level of 10%). Moreover, we found performance variations across word categories and colors: while LLMs tended to excel in categories such as Rhythm and Landscape, they struggled with categories such as Emotions. Interestingly, color discrimination ability estimated from our color-word association data showed high correlation with human color discrimination patterns, consistent with previous studies. Thus, despite reasonable alignment in basic color discrimination, humans and LLMs still diverge systematically in the words they assign to those colors. Our study highlights both the advancements in LLM capabilities and their persistent limitations, raising the possibility of systematic differences in semantic memory structures between humans and LLMs in representing color-word associations.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

One significant application of LLMs is in tackling software engineering challenges, particularly in resolving real-world tasks on GitHub by fixing code based on the issues reported by the users. However, many current approaches rely on proprietary LLMs, which limits reproducibility, accessibility, and transparency. The critical components of LLMs for addressing software engineering issues and how their capabilities can be effectively enhanced remain unclear. To address these challenges, we introduce SWE-Fixer, a novel open-source framework designed to effectively and efficiently resolve GitHub issues. SWE-Fixer comprises two essential modules: a code file retrieval module and a code editing module. The retrieval module employs BM25 along with a lightweight model to achieve coarse-to-fine file retrieval. Subsequently, the code editing module utilizes the other model to generate patches for the identified files. To mitigate the lack of publicly available datasets, we compile an extensive dataset that includes 110K GitHub issues along with their corresponding patches and train the two models of SWE-Fixer separately. We assess our approach on the SWE-Bench Lite and Verified benchmarks, achieving competitive performance among open-source models with scores of 22.0% and 30.2%. Furthermore, SWE-Fixer reaches state-of-the-art performance (24.7% on Lite and 32.8% on Verified) with PASS_TO_PASS (P2P) filtering. Additionally, our approach requires only two model calls per instance, making it significantly more efficient than existing methods. These results highlight the effectiveness of SWE-Fixer in real-world code-fixing scenarios. We will make our model, dataset, and code publicly available at https://github.com/InternLM/SWE-Fixer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code, data, and model will be released at https://github.com/InternLM/SWE-Fixer</p></details> |

We introduce a methodology for converting 113 existing FMWC challenges into programmatically evaluable JSON formats and use this dataset to compare the performance of several leading LLMs. Our findings demonstrate significant variations in performance across different challenge categories, with models showing specific strengths in pattern recognition tasks but struggling with complex numerical reasoning. The benchmark provides a standardized framework for assessing LLM capabilities in realistic business-oriented tasks rather than abstract academic problems. This research contributes to the growing field of AI benchmarking by establishing proficiency among the 1.5 billion people who daily use Microsoft Excel as a meaningful evaluation metric that bridges the gap between academic AI benchmarks and practical business applications.</p></details> |  |

However, current protections against web crawling or sample-specific memorization are inherently limited, as they require compliance from crawlers (e.g., respecting robots.txt) or model trainers (e.g., applying differential privacy). To empower data owners with direct control, we propose ExpShiled, a proactive self-defense mechanism that mitigates sample-specific memorization via imperceptible text perturbations. This approach requires no external collaboration while maintaining original readability. To evaluate individual-level defense efficacy, we first propose the metric of instance exploitation: a zero value indicates perfect defense, achieved when a protected text's log-perplexity ranking aligns with its counterfactual untrained ranking. We then reveal and validate the memorization trigger hypothesis, demonstrating that a model's memorization of a specific text sample stems primarily from its outlier tokens. Leveraging this insight, we design targeted perturbations that (1) prioritize inherent trigger tokens and (2) introduce artificial trigger tokens as pitfalls to disrupt memorization on the protected sample. Experiments validate our defense across model scales, languages, vision-to-language tasks, and fine-tuning methods. Even with privacy backdoors, the Membership Inference Attack (MIA) AUC drops from 0.95 to 0.55, and instance exploitation approaches zero. This suggests that compared to the ideal no-misuse scenario, the risk of exposing a text instance remains nearly unchanged despite its inclusion in training data.</p></details> | 13 pages |

With the prevalence of AI, researchers have identified numerous use cases of AI in network security. However, there are almost nonexistent studies that analyze the suitability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in network security. To fill this gap, we examine the suitability of LLMs in network security, particularly with the case study of STRIDE threat modeling. We utilize four prompting techniques with five LLMs to perform STRIDE classification of 5G threats. From our evaluation results, we point out key findings and detailed insights along with the explanation of the possible underlying factors influencing the behavior of LLMs in the modeling of certain threats. The numerical results and the insights support the necessity for adjusting and fine-tuning LLMs for network security use cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[DynamicControl: Adaptive Condition Selection for Improved Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03255v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To enhance the controllability of text-to-image diffusion models, current ControlNet-like models have explored various control signals to dictate image attributes. However, existing methods either handle conditions inefficiently or use a fixed number of conditions, which does not fully address the complexity of multiple conditions and their potential conflicts. This underscores the need for innovative approaches to manage multiple conditions effectively for more reliable and detailed image synthesis. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, DynamicControl, which supports dynamic combinations of diverse control signals, allowing adaptive selection of different numbers and types of conditions. Our approach begins with a double-cycle controller that generates an initial real score sorting for all input conditions by leveraging pre-trained conditional generation models and discriminative models. This controller evaluates the similarity between extracted conditions and input conditions, as well as the pixel-level similarity with the source image. Then, we integrate a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to build an efficient condition evaluator. This evaluator optimizes the ordering of conditions based on the double-cycle controller's score ranking. Our method jointly optimizes MLLMs and diffusion models, utilizing MLLMs' reasoning capabilities to facilitate multi-condition text-to-image (T2I) tasks. The final sorted conditions are fed into a parallel multi-control adapter, which learns feature maps from dynamic visual conditions and integrates them to modulate ControlNet, thereby enhancing control over generated images. Through both quantitative and qualitative comparisons, DynamicControl demonstrates its superiority over existing methods in terms of controllability, generation quality and composability under various conditional controls.</p></details> |  |

However, given a long conversation, these chatbots fail to recall past information and tend to generate inconsistent responses. To address this, we propose to recursively generate summaries/ memory using large language models (LLMs) to enhance long-term memory ability. Specifically, our method first stimulates LLMs to memorize small dialogue contexts and then recursively produce new memory using previous memory and following contexts. Finally, the chatbot can easily generate a highly consistent response with the help of the latest memory. We evaluate our method on both open and closed LLMs, and the experiments on the widely-used public dataset show that our method can generate more consistent responses in a long-context conversation. Also, we show that our strategy could nicely complement both long-context (e.g., 8K and 16K) and retrieval-enhanced LLMs, bringing further long-term dialogue performance. Notably, our method is a potential solution to enable the LLM to model the extremely long context. The code and scripts will be released later.</p></details> |  |

Parsing these scenes into semantic triplets <Subject-Predicate-Object> for accurate Scene Graph Generation (SGG) is highly challenging due to the fluctuating spatio-temporal complexity. Inspired by the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose SceneLLM, a novel framework that leverages LLMs as powerful scene analyzers for dynamic SGG. Our framework introduces a Video-to-Language (V2L) mapping module that transforms video frames into linguistic signals (scene tokens), making the input more comprehensible for LLMs. To better encode spatial information, we devise a Spatial Information Aggregation (SIA) scheme, inspired by the structure of Chinese characters, which encodes spatial data into tokens. Using Optimal Transport (OT), we generate an implicit language signal from the frame-level token sequence that captures the video's spatio-temporal information. To further improve the LLM's ability to process this implicit linguistic input, we apply Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the model. Finally, we use a transformer-based SGG predictor to decode the LLM's reasoning and predict semantic triplets. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the Action Genome (AG) benchmark, and extensive experiments show the effectiveness of SceneLLM in understanding and generating accurate dynamic scene graphs.</p></details> | 29 pages, 7 figures |

However, the capacity of LLMs to address math problems under unconventional conditions, such as internal inconsistencies and flawed assumptions, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel benchmark Unreasonable Math Problem (UMP) designed to assess LLMs' ability to recognize and respond to unreasonability in math problem. The benchmark consists of a carefully curated collection of unreasonable math questions across diverse types. Based on extensive experiments covering 19 LLMs, we observe that even state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o achieve only limited performance of 0.6 in UMP, while reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 are prone to overthinking and unstable. We further explore strategies for improving the recognition of unreasonable inputs, shedding light on both the possibility and limitations of LLMs in this challenging setting.</p></details> | 32 pages, 8 figures |

However, OpenAI APIs introduce unique challenges that differ from traditional APIs, such as the complexities of prompt engineering, token-based cost management, non-deterministic outputs, and operation as black boxes. To the best of our knowledge, the challenges developers encounter when using OpenAI APIs have not been explored in previous empirical studies. To fill this gap, we conduct the first comprehensive empirical study by analyzing 2,874 OpenAI API-related discussions from the popular Q&A forum Stack Overflow. We first examine the popularity and difficulty of these posts. After manually categorizing them into nine OpenAI API-related categories, we identify specific challenges associated with each category through topic modeling analysis. Based on our empirical findings, we finally propose actionable implications for developers, LLM vendors, and researchers.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeBC: A More Secure Large Language Model for Smart Contract Code Generation in Blockchain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21043v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating code from natural language instructions, yet they often lack an understanding of security vulnerabilities. This limitation makes it difficult for LLMs to avoid security risks in generated code, particularly in high-security programming tasks such as smart contract development for blockchain. Researchers have attempted to enhance the vulnerability awareness of these models by training them to differentiate between vulnerable and fixed code snippets. However, this approach relies heavily on manually labeled vulnerability data, which is only available for popular languages like Python and C++. For low-resource languages like Solidity, used in smart contracts, large-scale annotated datasets are scarce and difficult to obtain. To address this challenge, we introduce CodeBC, a code generation model specifically designed for generating secure smart contracts in blockchain. CodeBC employs a three-stage fine-tuning approach based on CodeLlama, distinguishing itself from previous methods by not relying on pairwise vulnerability location annotations. Instead, it leverages vulnerability and security tags to teach the model the differences between vulnerable and secure code. During the inference phase, the model leverages security tags to generate secure and robust code. Experimental results demonstrate that CodeBC outperforms baseline models in terms of BLEU, CodeBLEU, and compilation pass rates, while significantly reducing vulnerability rates. These findings validate the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of our three-stage fine-tuning strategy, making CodeBC a promising solution for generating secure smart contract code.</p></details> |  |

To address these questions, we introduce a novel classification framework that distinguishes between compute-dependent innovations -- which yield disproportionate benefits at high compute levels (e.g., the Transformer architecture and mixture-of-experts models) and compute-independent innovations, which improve efficiency across all compute scales (e.g., rotary positional encoding, FlashAttention, or layer normalization). We quantify these contributions using a metric called compute-equivalent gain (CEG), which estimates the additional compute that would be required to achieve similar improvements without these algorithmic advancements. To validate this framework, we conduct small-scale training experiments with a scaled-down GPT-2 model. Our results confirm that compute-independent advancements yield meaningful performance gains even in resource-constrained settings, with a CEG of up to $3.5\times$ over a baseline model. By contrast, compute-dependent advancements provided little benefit or even degraded performance at the small scale, reinforcing the importance of compute availability for certain algorithmic gains.</p></details> |  |

With the breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs), NLG has been widely used in various medical applications, demonstrating the potential to enhance clinical workflows, support clinical decision-making, and improve clinical documentation. Heterogeneous and diverse medical data modalities, such as medical text, images, and knowledge bases, are utilized in NLG. Researchers have proposed many generative models and applied them in a number of healthcare applications. There is a need for a comprehensive review of NLG methods and applications in the medical domain. In this study, we systematically reviewed 113 scientific publications from a total of 3,988 NLG-related articles identified using a literature search, focusing on data modality, model architecture, clinical applications, and evaluation methods. Following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, we categorize key methods, identify clinical applications, and assess their capabilities, limitations, and emerging challenges. This timely review covers the key NLG technologies and medical applications and provides valuable insights for future studies to leverage NLG to transform medical discovery and healthcare.</p></details> |  |

It enables LLMs to solve complex problems through tool calls while accessing up-to-date world knowledge. However, existing work primarily focuses on the fundamental ability of LLMs to invoke tools for problem-solving, without considering personalized constraints in tool invocation. In this work, we introduce the concept of Personalized Tool Invocation and define two key tasks: Tool Preference and Profile-dependent Query. Tool Preference addresses user preferences when selecting among functionally similar tools, while Profile-dependent Query considers cases where a user query lacks certain tool parameters, requiring the model to infer them from the user profile. To tackle these challenges, we propose PTool, a data synthesis framework designed for personalized tool invocation. Additionally, we construct \textbf{PTBench}, the first benchmark for evaluating personalized tool invocation. We then fine-tune various open-source models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework and providing valuable insights.

However, traditional optimization methods based on Artificial Noise (AN), power control, and channel manipulation might not adapt to dynamic and adversarial environments due to the high dimensionality, nonlinearity, and stringent real-time covertness requirements. To bridge this gap, we introduce Shadow Wireless Intelligence (SWI), which integrates the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation to enable intelligent decision-making in covert wireless systems. Specifically, we utilize DeepSeek-R1, a mixture-of-experts-based LLM with RL-enhanced reasoning, combined with real-time retrieval of domain-specific knowledge to improve context accuracy and mitigate hallucinations. Our approach develops a structured CC knowledge base, supports context-aware retrieval, and performs semantic optimization, allowing LLMs to generate and adapt CC strategies in real time. In a case study on optimizing AN power in a full-duplex CC scenario, DeepSeek-R1 achieves 85% symbolic derivation accuracy and 94% correctness in the generation of simulation code, outperforming baseline models. These results validate SWI as a robust, interpretable, and adaptive foundation for LLM-driven intelligent covert wireless systems in 6G networks.</p></details> |  |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning capabilities, their high computational cost and limited adaptability in dynamic scenarios hinder real-time deployment on edge devices. We present SmallPlan -- a novel framework leveraging LLMs as teacher models to train lightweight Small Language Models (SLMs) for high-level path planning tasks. In SmallPlan, the SLMs provide optimal action sequences to navigate across scene graphs that compactly represent full-scaled 3D scenes. The SLMs are trained in a simulation-powered, interleaved manner with LLM-guided supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). This strategy not only enables SLMs to successfully complete navigation tasks but also makes them aware of important factors like travel distance and number of trials. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the fine-tuned SLMs perform competitively with larger models like GPT-4o on sequential path planning, without suffering from hallucination and overfitting. SmallPlan is resource-efficient, making it well-suited for edge-device deployment and advancing practical autonomous robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper is under review</p></details> |
| **[BuildingBlock: A Hybrid Approach for Structured Building Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04051v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Three-dimensional building generation is vital for applications in gaming, virtual reality, and digital twins, yet current methods face challenges in producing diverse, structured, and hierarchically coherent buildings. We propose BuildingBlock, a hybrid approach that integrates generative models, procedural content generation (PCG), and large language models (LLMs) to address these limitations. Specifically, our method introduces a two-phase pipeline: the Layout Generation Phase (LGP) and the Building Construction Phase (BCP). LGP reframes box-based layout generation as a point-cloud generation task, utilizing a newly constructed architectural dataset and a Transformer-based diffusion model to create globally consistent layouts. With LLMs, these layouts are extended into rule-based hierarchical designs, seamlessly incorporating component styles and spatial structures. The BCP leverages these layouts to guide PCG, enabling local-customizable, high-quality structured building generation. Experimental results demonstrate BuildingBlock's effectiveness in generating diverse and hierarchically structured buildings, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, and paving the way for scalable and intuitive architectural workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIGGR...</summary><p>SIGGRAPH 2025 (Conference Track)</p></details> |
| **[Identification and Optimization of Redundant Code Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04040v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Redundant code is a persistent challenge in software development that makes systems harder to maintain, scale, and update. It adds unnecessary complexity, hinders bug fixes, and increases technical debt. Despite their impact, removing redundant code manually is risky and error-prone, often introducing new bugs or missing dependencies. While studies highlight the prevalence and negative impact of redundant code, little focus has been given to Artificial Intelligence (AI) system codebases and the common patterns that cause redundancy. Additionally, the reasons behind developers unintentionally introducing redundant code remain largely unexplored. This research addresses these gaps by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to automatically detect and optimize redundant code in AI projects. Our research aims to identify recurring patterns of redundancy and analyze their underlying causes, such as outdated practices or insufficient awareness of best coding principles. Additionally, we plan to propose an LLM agent that will facilitate the detection and refactoring of redundancies on a large scale while preserving original functionality. This work advances the application of AI in identifying and optimizing redundant code, ultimately helping developers maintain cleaner, more readable, and scalable codebases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-aware LLM-based Safe Control Against Latent Risks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11863v2)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous control systems face significant challenges in performing complex tasks in the presence of latent risks. To address this, we propose an integrated framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs), numerical optimization, and optimization-based control to facilitate efficient subtask learning while ensuring safety against latent risks. The framework decomposes complex tasks into a sequence of context-aware subtasks that account for latent risks. These subtasks and their parameters are then refined through a multi-time-scale process: high-layer multi-turn in-context learning, mid-layer LLM Chain-of-Thought reasoning and numerical optimization, and low-layer model predictive control. The framework iteratively improves decisions by leveraging qualitative feedback and optimized trajectory data from lower-layer optimization processes and a physics simulator. We validate the proposed framework through simulated case studies involving robot arm and autonomous vehicle scenarios. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework can mediate actions based on the context and latent risks and learn complex behaviors efficiently.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prism: Unleashing GPU Sharing for Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04021v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serving large language models (LLMs) is expensive, especially for providers hosting many models, making cost reduction essential. The unique workload patterns of serving multiple LLMs (i.e., multi-LLM serving) create new opportunities and challenges for this task. The long-tail popularity of models and their long idle periods present opportunities to improve utilization through GPU sharing. However, existing GPU sharing systems lack the ability to adjust their resource allocation and sharing policies at runtime, making them ineffective at meeting latency service-level objectives (SLOs) under rapidly fluctuating workloads. This paper presents Prism, a multi-LLM serving system that unleashes the full potential of GPU sharing to achieve both cost efficiency and SLO attainment. At its core, Prism tackles a key limitation of existing systems$\unicode{x2014}$the lack of $\textit{cross-model memory coordination}$, which is essential for flexibly sharing GPU memory across models under dynamic workloads. Prism achieves this with two key designs. First, it supports on-demand memory allocation by dynamically mapping physical to virtual memory pages, allowing flexible memory redistribution among models that space- and time-share a GPU. Second, it improves memory efficiency through a two-level scheduling policy that dynamically adjusts sharing strategies based on models' runtime demands. Evaluations on real-world traces show that Prism achieves more than $2\times$ cost savings and $3.3\times$ SLO attainment compared to state-of-the-art systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[SLOT: Structuring the Output of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04016v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Structured outputs are essential for large language models (LLMs) in critical applications like agents and information extraction. Despite their capabilities, LLMs often generate outputs that deviate from predefined schemas, significantly hampering reliable application development. We present SLOT (Structured LLM Output Transformer), a model-agnostic approach that transforms unstructured LLM outputs into precise structured formats. While existing solutions predominantly rely on constrained decoding techniques or are tightly coupled with specific models, SLOT employs a fine-tuned lightweight language model as a post-processing layer, achieving flexibility across various LLMs and schema specifications. We introduce a systematic pipeline for data curation and synthesis alongside a formal evaluation methodology that quantifies both schema accuracy and content fidelity. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuned Mistral-7B model with constrained decoding achieves near perfect schema accuracy (99.5%) and content similarity (94.0%), outperforming Claude-3.5-Sonnet by substantial margins (+25 and +20 percentage points, respectively). Notably, even compact models like Llama-3.2-1B can match or exceed the structured output capabilities of much larger proprietary models when equipped with SLOT, enabling reliable structured generation in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Universal and Black-Box Query-Response Only Attack on LLMs with QROA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02044v3)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has exposed critical security and ethical vulnerabilities, particularly their susceptibility to adversarial manipulations. This paper introduces QROA, a novel black-box jailbreak method designed to identify adversarial suffixes that can bypass LLM alignment safeguards when appended to a malicious instruction. Unlike existing suffix-based jailbreak approaches, QROA does not require access to the model's logit or any other internal information. It also eliminates reliance on human-crafted templates, operating solely through the standard query-response interface of LLMs. By framing the attack as an optimization bandit problem, QROA employs a surrogate model and token level optimization to efficiently explore suffix variations. Furthermore, we propose QROA-UNV, an extension that identifies universal adversarial suffixes for individual models, enabling one-query jailbreaks across a wide range of instructions. Testing on multiple models demonstrates Attack Success Rate (ASR) greater than 80\%. These findings highlight critical vulnerabilities, emphasize the need for advanced defenses, and contribute to the development of more robust safety evaluations for secure AI deployment.

| **[Adaptive Rank Allocation: Speeding Up Modern Transformers with RaNA Adapters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18216v2)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are computationally intensive, particularly during inference. Neuron-adaptive techniques, which selectively activate neurons in Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layers, offer some speedups but suffer from limitations in modern Transformers. These include reliance on sparse activations, incompatibility with attention layers, and the use of costly neuron masking techniques. To address these issues, we propose the Adaptive Rank Allocation framework and introduce the Rank and Neuron Allocator (RaNA) adapter. RaNA adapters leverage rank adapters, which operate on linear layers by applying both low-rank matrix decompositions and adaptive masking to efficiently allocate compute without depending on activation sparsity. This enables RaNA to be generally applied to MLPs and linear components of attention modules, while eliminating the need for expensive maskers found in neuron-adaptive methods. Notably, when compared to neuron adapters, RaNA improves perplexity by up to 7 points and increases accuracy by up to 8 percentage-points when reducing FLOPs by $\sim$44% in state-of-the-art Transformer architectures. These results position RaNA as a robust solution for improving inference efficiency in modern Transformer architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Towards a HIPAA Compliant Agentic AI System in Healthcare](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17669v2)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic AI systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) as their foundational reasoning engine, are transforming clinical workflows such as medical report generation and clinical summarization by autonomously analyzing sensitive healthcare data and executing decisions with minimal human oversight. However, their adoption demands strict compliance with regulatory frameworks such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), particularly when handling Protected Health Information (PHI). This work-in-progress paper introduces a HIPAA-compliant Agentic AI framework that enforces regulatory compliance through dynamic, context-aware policy enforcement. Our framework integrates three core mechanisms: (1) Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) for granular PHI governance, (2) a hybrid PHI sanitization pipeline combining regex patterns and BERT-based model to minimize leakage, and (3) immutable audit trails for compliance verification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Large Language Models Predict Parallel Code Performance?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03988v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate determination of the performance of parallel GPU code typically requires execution-time profiling on target hardware -- an increasingly prohibitive step due to limited access to high-end GPUs. This paper explores whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can offer an alternative approach for GPU performance prediction without relying on hardware. We frame the problem as a roofline classification task: given the source code of a GPU kernel and the hardware specifications of a target GPU, can an LLM predict whether the GPU kernel is compute-bound or bandwidth-bound? For this study, we build a balanced dataset of 340 GPU kernels, obtained from HeCBench benchmark and written in CUDA and OpenMP, along with their ground-truth labels obtained via empirical GPU profiling. We evaluate LLMs across four scenarios: (1) with access to profiling data of the kernel source, (2) zero-shot with source code only, (3) few-shot with code and label pairs, and (4) fine-tuned on a small custom dataset. Our results show that state-of-the-art LLMs have a strong understanding of the Roofline model, achieving 100% classification accuracy when provided with explicit profiling data. We also find that reasoning-capable LLMs significantly outperform standard LLMs in zero- and few-shot settings, achieving up to 64% accuracy on GPU source codes, without profiling information. Lastly, we find that LLM fine-tuning will require much more data than what we currently have available. This work is among the first to use LLMs for source-level roofline performance prediction via classification, and illustrates their potential to guide optimization efforts when runtime profiling is infeasible. Our findings suggest that with better datasets and prompt strategies, LLMs could become practical tools for HPC performance analysis and performance portability.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, accepted to AI4Sys Workshop at HPDC 2025</p></details> |

To ensure call-taking performance consistency, quality assurance is implemented to evaluate and refine call-takers' skillsets. However, traditional human-led evaluations struggle with high call volumes, leading to low coverage and delayed assessments. We introduce LogiDebrief, an AI-driven framework that automates traditional 9-1-1 call debriefing by integrating Signal-Temporal Logic (STL) with Large Language Models (LLMs) for fully-covered rigorous performance evaluation. LogiDebrief formalizes call-taking requirements as logical specifications, enabling systematic assessment of 9-1-1 calls against procedural guidelines. It employs a three-step verification process: (1) contextual understanding to identify responder types, incident classifications, and critical conditions; (2) STL-based runtime checking with LLM integration to ensure compliance; and (3) automated aggregation of results into quality assurance reports. Beyond its technical contributions, LogiDebrief has demonstrated real-world impact. Successfully deployed at Metro Nashville Department of Emergency Communications, it has assisted in debriefing 1,701 real-world calls, saving 311.85 hours of active engagement. Empirical evaluation with real-world data confirms its accuracy, while a case study and extensive user study highlight its effectiveness in enhancing call-taking performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IJCAI-2025</p></details> |

To address this, we introduce two novel legal RAG benchmarks: Bar Exam QA and Housing Statute QA. Our tasks correspond to real-world legal research tasks, and were produced through annotation processes which resemble legal research. We describe the construction of these benchmarks and the performance of existing retriever pipelines.

| **[On the generalization of language models from in-context learning and finetuning: a controlled study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00661v2)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models exhibit exciting capabilities, yet can show surprisingly narrow generalization from finetuning. E.g. they can fail to generalize to simple reversals of relations they are trained on, or fail to make simple logical deductions based on trained information. These failures to generalize from fine-tuning can hinder practical application of these models. On the other hand, language models' in-context learning shows different inductive biases, and can generalize better in some cases. Here, we explore these differences in generalization between in-context- and fine-tuning-based learning. To do so, we constructed several novel datasets to evaluate and improve models' abilities to generalize from finetuning data. The datasets are designed to create clean tests of generalization, by isolating the knowledge in the dataset from that in pretraining. We expose pretrained large models to controlled subsets of the information in these datasets -- either in context, or through fine-tuning -- and evaluate their performance on test sets that require various types of generalization. We find overall that in data-matched settings, in-context learning can generalize more flexibly than fine-tuning (though we also find some qualifications of prior findings, such as cases when fine-tuning can generalize to reversals embedded in a larger structure of knowledge). We build on these findings to propose a method to enable improved generalization from fine-tuning: adding in-context inferences to finetuning data. We show that this method improves generalization across various splits of our datasets and other benchmarks. Our results have implications for understanding the inductive biases of different modes of learning in language models, and practically improving their performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Is In-Context Learning a Type of Error-Driven Learning? Evidence from the Inverse Frequency Effect in Structural Priming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18501v2)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown the emergent capability of in-context learning (ICL). One line of research has claimed that ICL is functionally equivalent to gradient descent, a type of error-driven learning mechanism. In this paper, we introduce a new way of diagnosing whether ICL is functionally performing error-driven learning. Our approach is based on the inverse frequency effect (IFE) -- a phenomenon in which an agent's behavior is influenced to a greater degree when presented with improbable examples as compared to more likely ones. The IFE has previously been identified in psycholinguistics where humans exhibit the IFE in the context of structural priming (the tendency for people to produce sentence structures they have encountered recently). In that context, the IFE has been used as evidence that human structural priming must involve error-driven learning mechanisms. In our experiments, we simulated structural priming with ICL and found that LLMs indeed display the IFE, with the effect being stronger in larger models. We conclude that at least in the case we studied, ICL is indeed a type of error-driven learning, supporting the hypothesis that an error signal is implicitly computed in the forward pass during ICL. Our results suggest that both humans and LLMs make use of error-driven processing mechanisms in on-line processing.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version is accepted to NAACL 2025 (https://aclanthology.org/2025.naacl-long.586/)</p></details> |

HPC code requires specialized optimizations for parallelism, memory efficiency, and architecture-specific considerations that general-purpose LLMs often overlook. We present MARCO (Multi-Agent Reactive Code Optimizer), a novel framework that enhances LLM-generated code for HPC through a specialized multi-agent architecture. MARCO employs separate agents for code generation and performance evaluation, connected by a feedback loop that progressively refines optimizations. A key innovation is MARCO's web-search component that retrieves real-time optimization techniques from recent conference proceedings and research publications, bridging the knowledge gap in pre-trained LLMs. Our extensive evaluation on the LeetCode 75 problem set demonstrates that MARCO achieves a 14.6% average runtime reduction compared to Claude 3.5 Sonnet alone, while the integration of the web-search component yields a 30.9% performance improvement over the base MARCO system. These results highlight the potential of multi-agent systems to address the specialized requirements of high-performance code generation, offering a cost-effective alternative to domain-specific model fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

While ChatGPT's potential has been extensively discussed, there is limited empirical evidence exploring its real-world usage by developers. This study bridges this gap by conducting a large-scale empirical analysis of ChatGPT-assisted development activities, leveraging a curated dataset, DevChat, comprising 2,547 unique shared ChatGPT links collected from GitHub between May 2023 and June 2024. Our study examines the characteristics of ChatGPT's usage on GitHub (including the tendency, prompt turns distribution, and link descriptions) and identifies five categories of developers' purposes for sharing developer-ChatGPT conversations during software development. Additionally, we analyzed the development-related activities where developers shared ChatGPT links to facilitate their workflows. We then established a mapping framework among data sources, activities, and SE tasks associated with these shared ChatGPT links. Our study offers a comprehensive view of ChatGPT's application in real-world software development scenarios and provides a foundation for its future integration into software development workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 10 images, 2 tables, Manuscript submitted to a journal (2025)</p></details> |

However, the existing speech models still experience high latency when generating the first audio token during streaming, which poses a significant bottleneck for deployment. To address this issue, we propose VITA-Audio, an end-to-end large speech model with fast audio-text token generation. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight Multiple Cross-modal Token Prediction (MCTP) module that efficiently generates multiple audio tokens within a single model forward pass, which not only accelerates the inference but also significantly reduces the latency for generating the first audio in streaming scenarios. In addition, a four-stage progressive training strategy is explored to achieve model acceleration with minimal loss of speech quality. To our knowledge, VITA-Audio is the first multi-modal large language model capable of generating audio output during the first forward pass, enabling real-time conversational capabilities with minimal latency. VITA-Audio is fully reproducible and is trained on open-source data only. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves an inference speedup of 3~5x at the 7B parameter scale, but also significantly outperforms open-source models of similar model size on multiple benchmarks for automatic speech recognition (ASR), text-to-speech (TTS), and spoken question answering (SQA) tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Train...</summary><p>Training and Inference Codes: https://github.com/VITA-MLLM/VITA-Audio</p></details> |

The recent integration of web search results into LLMs prompts the question of whether people utilize them to verify the generated content, thereby accurately detecting hallucinations. An online experiment (N = 560) investigated how the provision of search results, either static (i.e., fixed search results provided by LLM) or dynamic (i.e., participant-led searches), affects participants' perceived accuracy of LLM-generated content (i.e., genuine, minor hallucination, major hallucination), self-confidence in accuracy ratings, as well as their overall evaluation of the LLM, as compared to the control condition (i.e., no search results). Results showed that participants in both static and dynamic conditions (vs. control) rated hallucinated content to be less accurate and perceived the LLM more negatively. However, those in the dynamic condition rated genuine content as more accurate and demonstrated greater overall self-confidence in their assessments than those in the static search or control conditions. We highlighted practical implications of incorporating web search functionality into LLMs in real-world contexts.</p></details> |  |

Mobile diary entries provide a promising method for tracking emotional states, improving self-awareness, and promoting well-being outcome. This paper aims to, through mobile diaries, understand cancer survivors' emotional states and key variables related to just-in-time intervention opportunities, including the desire to regulate emotions and the availability to engage in interventions. Although emotion analysis tools show potential for recognizing emotions from text, current methods lack the contextual understanding necessary to interpret brief mobile diary narratives. Our analysis of diary entries from cancer survivors (N=407) reveals systematic relationships between described contexts and emotional states, with administrative and health-related contexts associated with negative affect and regulation needs, while leisure activities promote positive emotions. We propose CALLM, a Context-Aware framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to analyze these brief entries by integrating retrieved peer experiences and personal diary history. CALLM demonstrates strong performance with balanced accuracies reaching 72.96% for positive affect, 73.29% for negative affect, 73.72% for emotion regulation desire, and 60.09% for intervention availability, outperforming language model baselines. Post-hoc analysis reveals that model confidence strongly predicts accuracy, with longer diary entries generally enhancing performance, and brief personalization periods yielding meaningful improvements. Our findings demonstrate how contextual information in mobile diaries can be effectively leveraged to understand emotional experiences, predict key states, and identify optimal intervention moments for personalized just-in-time support.</p></details> |  |

However, given a long paragraph (up to 512 words), these generation models still struggle to achieve strong alignment and are unable to generate images depicting complex scenes. In this paper, we introduce an information-enriched diffusion model for paragraph-to-image generation task, termed ParaDiffusion, which delves into the transference of the extensive semantic comprehension capabilities of large language models to the task of image generation. At its core is using a large language model (e.g., Llama V2) to encode long-form text, followed by fine-tuning with LORA to alignthe text-image feature spaces in the generation task. To facilitate the training of long-text semantic alignment, we also curated a high-quality paragraph-image pair dataset, namely ParaImage. This dataset contains a small amount of high-quality, meticulously annotated data, and a large-scale synthetic dataset with long text descriptions being generated using a vision-language model. Experiments demonstrate that ParaDiffusion outperforms state-of-the-art models (SD XL, DeepFloyd IF) on ViLG-300 and ParaPrompts, achieving up to 15% and 45% human voting rate improvements for visual appeal and text faithfulness, respectively. The code and dataset will be released to foster community research on long-text alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The project website is at: https://weijiawu.github.io/ParaDiffusionPage/.

We investigate how the model's performance is affected by the chosen layout paradigm, the aesthetics of the drawing, and the prompting technique used for the queries. We formulate three corresponding research questions and present the results of a thorough experimental analysis. Our findings reveal that choosing the right layout paradigm and optimizing the readability of the input drawing from a human perspective can significantly improve the performance of the model on the given task. Moreover, selecting the most effective prompting technique is a challenging yet crucial task for achieving optimal performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Binding threshold units with artificial oscillatory neurons](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03648v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial Kuramoto oscillatory neurons were recently introduced as an alternative to threshold units. Empirical evidence suggests that oscillatory units outperform threshold units in several tasks including unsupervised object discovery and certain reasoning problems. The proposed coupling mechanism for these oscillatory neurons is heterogeneous, combining a generalized Kuramoto equation with standard coupling methods used for threshold units. In this research note, we present a theoretical framework that clearly distinguishes oscillatory neurons from threshold units and establishes a coupling mechanism between them. We argue that, from a biological standpoint, oscillatory and threshold units realise distinct aspects of neural coding: roughly, threshold units model intensity of neuron firing, while oscillatory units facilitate information exchange by frequency modulation. To derive interaction between these two types of units, we constrain their dynamics by focusing on dynamical systems that admit Lyapunov functions. For threshold units, this leads to Hopfield associative memory model, and for oscillatory units it yields a specific form of generalized Kuramoto model. The resulting dynamical systems can be naturally coupled to form a Hopfield-Kuramoto associative memory model, which also admits a Lyapunov function. Various forms of coupling are possible. Notably, oscillatory neurons can be employed to implement a low-rank correction to the weight matrix of a Hopfield network. This correction can be viewed either as a form of Hebbian learning or as a popular LoRA method used for fine-tuning of large language models. We demonstrate the practical realization of this particular coupling through illustrative toy experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[PhysLLM: Harnessing Large Language Models for Cross-Modal Remote Physiological Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03621v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) enables non-contact physiological measurement but remains highly susceptible to illumination changes, motion artifacts, and limited temporal modeling. Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at capturing long-range dependencies, offering a potential solution but struggle with the continuous, noise-sensitive nature of rPPG signals due to their text-centric design. To bridge this gap, we introduce PhysLLM, a collaborative optimization framework that synergizes LLMs with domain-specific rPPG components. Specifically, the Text Prototype Guidance (TPG) strategy is proposed to establish cross-modal alignment by projecting hemodynamic features into LLM-interpretable semantic space, effectively bridging the representational gap between physiological signals and linguistic tokens. Besides, a novel Dual-Domain Stationary (DDS) Algorithm is proposed for resolving signal instability through adaptive time-frequency domain feature re-weighting. Finally, rPPG task-specific cues systematically inject physiological priors through physiological statistics, environmental contextual answering, and task description, leveraging cross-modal learning to integrate both visual and textual information, enabling dynamic adaptation to challenging scenarios like variable illumination and subject movements. Evaluation on four benchmark datasets, PhysLLM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness, demonstrating superior generalization across lighting variations and motion scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[BIG-Bench Extra Hard](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19187v2)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in everyday applications, demanding robust general reasoning capabilities and diverse reasoning skillset. However, current LLM reasoning benchmarks predominantly focus on mathematical and coding abilities, leaving a gap in evaluating broader reasoning proficiencies. One particular exception is the BIG-Bench dataset, which has served as a crucial benchmark for evaluating the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs, thanks to its diverse set of challenging tasks that allowed for a comprehensive assessment of general reasoning across various skills within a unified framework. However, recent advances in LLMs have led to saturation on BIG-Bench, and its harder version BIG-Bench Hard (BBH). State-of-the-art models achieve near-perfect scores on many tasks in BBH, thus diminishing its utility. To address this limitation, we introduce BIG-Bench Extra Hard (BBEH), a new benchmark designed to push the boundaries of LLM reasoning evaluation. BBEH replaces each task in BBH with a novel task that probes a similar reasoning capability but exhibits significantly increased difficulty. We evaluate various models on BBEH and observe a (harmonic) average accuracy of 9.8\% for the best general-purpose model and 44.8\% for the best reasoning-specialized model, indicating substantial room for improvement and highlighting the ongoing challenge of achieving robust general reasoning in LLMs. We release BBEH publicly at: https://github.com/google-deepmind/bbeh.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Quantitative Evaluation of Approximate Softmax Functions for Deep Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13379v2)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The softmax function is a widely used activation function in the output layers of neural networks, responsible for converting raw scores into class probabilities while introducing essential non-linearity. Implementing Softmax efficiently poses challenges on low-end FPGAs due to limited hardware resources and the computational complexity of exponential and division operations. This work evaluates approximate computing techniques for softmax acceleration using Taylor series and interpolation methods using Look-Up Tables (LUTs). These approximations aim to reduce execution time and resource consumption while maintaining acceptable levels of numerical precision. Our findings show that quadratic interpolation with LUTs yields the lowest numerical error. In contrast, Taylor-based approximations offer significantly better performance in terms of execution time and resource efficiency due to their computational simplicity. When applied to real-world deep learning models such as LeNet-5 and MobileNet v2, the first- and second-order Taylor approximations provided substantial trade-offs between accuracy and resource savings, achieving up to 0.2% accuracy degradation and 14% resource reduction compared to exact implementations. These results highlight the effectiveness of approximate Softmax designs on resource-constrained FPGAs and lay the groundwork for their integration into larger models, including large language models (LLMs).</p></details> | <details><summary>A new...</summary><p>A new author has been added due to his contributions in the FPGA part (Section IV)</p></details> |

Current approaches predominantly utilize visual models. However, these methods often capture information implicitly from images, lacking interpretable spatial-temporal object representations. To address this issue we introduce DyGEnc - a novel method for Encoding a Dynamic Graph. This method integrates compressed spatial-temporal structural observation representation with the cognitive capabilities of large language models. The purpose of this integration is to enable advanced question answering based on a sequence of textual scene graphs. Extended evaluations on the STAR and AGQA datasets indicate that DyGEnc outperforms existing visual methods by a large margin of 15-25% in addressing queries regarding the history of human-to-object interactions. Furthermore, the proposed method can be seamlessly extended to process raw input images utilizing foundational models for extracting explicit textual scene graphs, as substantiated by the results of a robotic experiment conducted with a wheeled manipulator platform. We hope that these findings will contribute to the implementation of robust and compressed graph-based robotic memory for long-horizon reasoning.

Despite the progress of sentence embedding methods, it remains unclear how to best modify a sentence embedding conditioned on its context. To address this problem, we propose Condition-Aware Sentence Embeddings (CASE), an efficient and accurate method to create an embedding for a sentence under a given condition. First, CASE creates an embedding for the condition using a Large Language Model (LLM), where the sentence influences the attention scores computed for the tokens in the condition during pooling. Next, a supervised nonlinear projection is learned to reduce the dimensionality of the LLM-based text embeddings. We show that CASE significantly outperforms previously proposed Conditional Semantic Textual Similarity (C-STS) methods on an existing standard benchmark dataset. We find that subtracting the condition embedding consistently improves the C-STS performance of LLM-based text embeddings. Moreover, we propose a supervised dimensionality reduction method that not only reduces the dimensionality of LLM-based embeddings but also significantly improves their performance.</p></details> |  |

These capabilities introduce new security risks that existing security measures, such as model fine-tuning or chatbot-focused guardrails, do not fully address. Given the higher stakes and the absence of deterministic solutions to mitigate these risks, there is a critical need for a real-time guardrail monitor to serve as a final layer of defense, and support system level, use case specific safety policy definition and enforcement. We introduce LlamaFirewall, an open-source security focused guardrail framework designed to serve as a final layer of defense against security risks associated with AI Agents. Our framework mitigates risks such as prompt injection, agent misalignment, and insecure code risks through three powerful guardrails: PromptGuard 2, a universal jailbreak detector that demonstrates clear state of the art performance; Agent Alignment Checks, a chain-of-thought auditor that inspects agent reasoning for prompt injection and goal misalignment, which, while still experimental, shows stronger efficacy at preventing indirect injections in general scenarios than previously proposed approaches; and CodeShield, an online static analysis engine that is both fast and extensible, aimed at preventing the generation of insecure or dangerous code by coding agents. Additionally, we include easy-to-use customizable scanners that make it possible for any developer who can write a regular expression or an LLM prompt to quickly update an agent's security guardrails.</p></details> |  |

While prior work has explored simple formatting changes, these rarely capture the kinds of natural variation seen in real-world language use. We propose a controlled paraphrasing framework based on a taxonomy of minimal linguistic transformations to systematically generate natural prompt variations. Using the BBQ dataset, we validate our method with both human annotations and automated checks, then use it to study how LLMs respond to paraphrased prompts in stereotype evaluation tasks. Our analysis shows that even subtle prompt modifications can lead to substantial changes in model behavior. These results highlight the need for robust, paraphrase-aware evaluation protocols.</p></details> |  |

Large artificial intelligence models (LAMs) are characterized by significantly larger scales (e.g., billions or trillions of parameters) compared to typical artificial intelligence (AI) models. LAMs exhibit outstanding cognitive abilities, including strong generalization capabilities for fine-tuning to downstream tasks, and emergent capabilities to handle tasks unseen during training. Therefore, LAMs efficiently provide AI services for diverse communication applications, making them crucial tools for addressing complex challenges in future wireless communication systems. This study provides a comprehensive review of the foundations, applications, and challenges of LAMs in communication. First, we introduce the current state of AI-based communication systems, emphasizing the motivation behind integrating LAMs into communications and summarizing the key contributions. We then present an overview of the essential concepts of LAMs in communication. This includes an introduction to the main architectures of LAMs, such as transformer, diffusion models, and mamba. We also explore the classification of LAMs, including large language models (LLMs), large vision models (LVMs), large multimodal models (LMMs), and world models, and examine their potential applications in communication. Additionally, we cover the training methods and evaluation techniques for LAMs in communication systems. Lastly, we introduce optimization strategies such as chain of thought (CoT), retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and agentic systems. Following this, we discuss the research advancements of LAMs across various communication scenarios. Finally, we analyze the challenges in the current research and provide insights into potential future research directions.</p></details> |  |

When different proprietary reasoning models (RMs), such as those by OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, DeepSeek, and xAI, are given the same complex request, they often produce divergent results due to variations in training and inference. This paper proposes a novel consensus mechanism, inspired by distributed ledger technology, to validate and converge these outputs, treating each RM as a black-box peer. Building on the Hashgraph consensus algorithm, our approach employs gossip-about-gossip communication and virtual voting to achieve agreement among an ensemble of RMs. We present an architectural design for a prototype system in which RMs iteratively exchange and update their answers, using information from each round to improve accuracy and confidence in subsequent rounds. This approach goes beyond simple majority voting by incorporating the knowledge and cross-verification content of every model. We justify the feasibility of this Hashgraph-inspired consensus for AI ensembles and outline its advantages over traditional ensembling techniques in reducing nonfactual outputs. Preliminary considerations for implementation, evaluation criteria for convergence and accuracy, and potential challenges are discussed. The proposed mechanism demonstrates a promising direction for multi-agent AI systems to self-validate and deliver high-fidelity responses in complex tasks.</p></details> | 15 pages |

Adaptive retrieval aims to retrieve only when necessary, but existing approaches rely on LLM-based uncertainty estimation, which remain inefficient and impractical. In this study, we introduce lightweight LLM-independent adaptive retrieval methods based on external information. We investigated 27 features, organized into 7 groups, and their hybrid combinations. We evaluated these methods on 6 QA datasets, assessing the QA performance and efficiency. The results show that our approach matches the performance of complex LLM-based methods while achieving significant efficiency gains, demonstrating the potential of external information for adaptive retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, complex tasks requiring multi-round retrieval remain challenging, and early attempts tend to be overly optimistic without a good sense of self-skepticism. Current multi-round RAG systems may continue searching even when enough information has already been retrieved, or they may provide incorrect answers without having sufficient information or knowledge. Existing solutions either require large amounts of expensive human-labeled process supervision data or lead to subpar performance. This paper aims to address these limitations by introducing a new framework, \textbf{SIM-RAG}, to explicitly enhance RAG systems' self-awareness and multi-round retrieval capabilities. To train SIM-RAG, we first let a RAG system self-practice multi-round retrieval, augmenting existing question-answer pairs with intermediate inner monologue reasoning steps to generate synthetic training data. For each pair, the system may explore multiple retrieval paths, which are labeled as successful if they reach the correct answer and unsuccessful otherwise. Using this data, we train a lightweight information sufficiency Critic. At inference time, the Critic evaluates whether the RAG system has retrieved sufficient information at each round, guiding retrieval decisions and improving system-level self-awareness through in-context reinforcement learning. Experiments across multiple prominent RAG benchmarks show that SIM-RAG is an effective multi-round RAG solution. Furthermore, this framework is system-efficient, adding a lightweight component to RAG without requiring modifications to existing LLMs or search engines, and data-efficient, eliminating the need for costly human-annotated mid-step retrieval process supervision data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 48th International ACM SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

This results in non-uniform cluster access patterns in disk-based vector search systems, particularly in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. While existing approaches optimize individual queries, they overlook the impact of cluster access patterns, failing to account for the locality effects of queries that access similar clusters. This oversight reduces cache efficiency and increases search latency due to excessive disk I/O. To address this, we introduce CaGR-RAG, a context-aware query grouping mechanism that organizes queries based on shared cluster access patterns. Additionally, it incorporates opportunistic cluster prefetching to minimize cache misses during transitions between query groups, further optimizing retrieval performance. Experimental results show that CaGR-RAG reduces 99th percentile tail latency by up to 51.55% while consistently maintaining a higher cache hit ratio than the baseline.</p></details> |  |

A Survey of Methods and Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20119v2)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has advanced significantly in recent years. The complexity of RAG systems, which involve multiple components-such as indexing, retrieval, and generation-along with numerous other parameters, poses substantial challenges for systematic evaluation and quality enhancement. Previous research highlights that evaluating RAG systems is essential for documenting advancements, comparing configurations, and identifying effective approaches for domain-specific applications. This study systematically reviews 63 academic articles to provide a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art RAG evaluation methodologies, focusing on four key areas: datasets, retrievers, indexing and databases, and the generator component. We observe the feasibility of an automated evaluation approach for each component of a RAG system, leveraging an LLM capable of both generating evaluation datasets and conducting evaluations. In addition, we found that further practical research is essential to provide companies with clear guidance on the do's and don'ts of implementing and evaluating RAG systems. By synthesizing evaluation approaches for key RAG components and emphasizing the creation and adaptation of domain-specific datasets for benchmarking, we contribute to the advancement of systematic evaluation methods and the improvement of evaluation rigor for RAG systems. Furthermore, by examining the interplay between automated approaches leveraging LLMs and human judgment, we contribute to the ongoing discourse on balancing automation and human input, clarifying their respective contributions, limitations, and challenges in achieving robust and reliable evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 Pag...</summary><p>8 Pages.

A clear separation of private information from the LLM training has made RAG the basis for many enterprise LLM workloads as it allows the company to augment LLM's understanding using customers' private documents. Despite its popularity for private documents in enterprise deployments, current RAG benchmarks for validating and optimizing RAG pipelines draw their corpora from public data such as Wikipedia or generic web pages and offer little to no personal context. Seeking to empower more personal and private RAG we release the EnronQA benchmark, a dataset of 103,638 emails with 528,304 question-answer pairs across 150 different user inboxes. EnronQA enables better benchmarking of RAG pipelines over private data and allows for experimentation on the introduction of personalized retrieval settings over realistic data. Finally, we use EnronQA to explore the tradeoff in memorization and retrieval when reasoning over private documents.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[SAGE: A Framework of Precise Retrieval for RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01713v2)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated significant proficiency in conducting question-answering (QA) tasks within a specified corpus. Nonetheless, numerous failure instances of RAG in QA still exist. These failures are not solely attributable to the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs); instead, they predominantly arise from the retrieval of inaccurate information for LLMs due to two limitations: (1) Current RAG methods segment the corpus without considering semantics, making it difficult to find relevant context due to impaired correlation between questions and the segments. (2) There is a trade-off between missing essential context with fewer context retrieved and getting irrelevant context with more context retrieved. In this paper, we introduce a RAG framework (SAGE), to overcome these limitations. First, to address the segmentation issue without considering semantics, we propose to train a semantic segmentation model. This model is trained to segment the corpus into semantically complete chunks. Second, to ensure that only the most relevant chunks are retrieved while the irrelevant ones are ignored, we design a chunk selection algorithm to dynamically select chunks based on the decreasing speed of the relevance score, leading to a more relevant selection. Third, to further ensure the precision of the retrieved chunks, we propose letting LLMs assess whether retrieved chunks are excessive or lacking and then adjust the amount of context accordingly. Experiments show that SAGE outperforms baselines by 61.25% in the quality of QA on average. Moreover, by avoiding retrieving noisy context, SAGE lowers the cost of the tokens consumed in LLM inference and achieves a 49.41% enhancement in cost efficiency on average. Additionally, our work offers valuable insights for boosting RAG.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) provides a promising post-training solution by leveraging external knowledge. However, existing medical RAG systems suffer from two key limitations: (1) a lack of modeling for human-like reasoning behaviors during information retrieval, and (2) reliance on suboptimal medical corpora, which often results in the retrieval of irrelevant or noisy snippets. To overcome these challenges, we propose Discuss-RAG, a plug-and-play module designed to enhance the medical QA RAG system through collaborative agent-based reasoning. Our method introduces a summarizer agent that orchestrates a team of medical experts to emulate multi-turn brainstorming, thereby improving the relevance of retrieved content. Additionally, a decision-making agent evaluates the retrieved snippets before their final integration. Experimental results on four benchmark medical QA datasets show that Discuss-RAG consistently outperforms MedRAG, especially significantly improving answer accuracy by up to 16.67% on BioASQ and 12.20% on PubMedQA.

Within financial sectors, modern enterprises increasingly rely on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to address complex compliance requirements in financial document workflows. However, existing solutions struggle to account for the inherent heterogeneity of data (e.g., text, tables, diagrams) and evolving nature of regulatory standards used in financial filings, leading to compromised accuracy in critical information extraction. We propose the FinSage framework as a solution, utilizing a multi-aspect RAG framework tailored for regulatory compliance analysis in multi-modal financial documents. FinSage introduces three innovative components: (1) a multi-modal pre-processing pipeline that unifies diverse data formats and generates chunk-level metadata summaries, (2) a multi-path sparse-dense retrieval system augmented with query expansion (HyDE) and metadata-aware semantic search, and (3) a domain-specialized re-ranking module fine-tuned via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to prioritize compliance-critical content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FinSage achieves an impressive recall of 92.51% on 75 expert-curated questions derived from surpasses the best baseline method on the FinanceBench question answering datasets by 24.06% in accuracy. Moreover, FinSage has been successfully deployed as financial question-answering agent in online meetings, where it has already served more than 1,200 people.</p></details> |  |

Traditional RAG enhancements have explored vertical scaling-assigning subtasks to specialized modules-and horizontal scaling-replicating tasks across multiple agents-to improve performance. However, real-world applications impose diverse Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, involving trade-offs among objectives such as reducing cost, ensuring answer quality, and adhering to specific operational constraints. In this work, we present a systems-oriented approach to multi-agent RAG tailored for real-world Question Answering (QA) applications. By integrating task-specific non-functional requirements-such as answer quality, cost, and latency-into the system, we enable dynamic reconfiguration to meet diverse SLAs. Our method maps these Service Level Objectives (SLOs) to system-level parameters, allowing the generation of optimal results within specified resource constraints. We conduct a case study in the QA domain, demonstrating how dynamic re-orchestration of a multi-agent RAG system can effectively manage the trade-off between answer quality and cost. By adjusting the system based on query intent and operational conditions, we systematically balance performance and resource utilization. This approach allows the system to meet SLOs for various query types, showcasing its practicality for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

It proposes a state-aware dynamic knowledge retrieval mechanism to enhance semantic understanding and knowledge scheduling efficiency in large language models for open-domain question answering and complex generation tasks. The method introduces a multi-level perceptive retrieval vector construction strategy and a differentiable document matching path. These components enable end-to-end joint training and collaborative optimization of the retrieval and generation modules. This effectively addresses the limitations of static RAG structures in context adaptation and knowledge access. Experiments are conducted on the Natural Questions dataset. The proposed structure is thoroughly evaluated across different large models, including GPT-4, GPT-4o, and DeepSeek. Comparative and ablation experiments from multiple perspectives confirm the significant improvements in BLEU and ROUGE-L scores. The approach also demonstrates stronger robustness and generation consistency in tasks involving semantic ambiguity and multi-document fusion. These results highlight its broad application potential and practical value in building high-quality language generation systems.</p></details> |  |

As a result, recent efforts focus on instruction-tuning open-source LLMs, though the potential of combining them with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we are the first to explore a knowledge graph-based (KG) RAG framework for Japanese medical QA small-scale open-source LLMs. Experimental results show that KG-based RAG has only a limited impact on Japanese medical QA using small-scale open-source LLMs. Further case studies reveal that the effectiveness of the RAG is sensitive to the quality and relevance of the external retrieved content. These findings offer valuable insights into the challenges and potential of applying RAG in Japanese medical QA, while also serving as a reference for other low-resource languages.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[W-RAG: Weakly Supervised Dense Retrieval in RAG for Open-domain Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08444v2)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In knowledge-intensive tasks such as open-domain question answering (OpenQA), large language models (LLMs) often struggle to generate factual answers, relying solely on their internal (parametric) knowledge. To address this limitation, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance LLMs by retrieving relevant information from external sources, thereby positioning the retriever as a pivotal component. Although dense retrieval demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, its training poses challenges due to the scarcity of ground-truth evidence, largely attributed to the high costs of human annotation. In this paper, we propose W-RAG, a method that draws weak training signals from the downstream task (such as OpenQA) of an LLM, and fine-tunes the retriever to prioritize passages that most benefit the task. Specifically, we rerank the top-$k$ passages retrieved via BM25 by assessing the probability that the LLM will generate the correct answer for a question given each passage. The highest-ranking passages are then used as positive fine-tuning examples for dense retrieval. We conduct comprehensive experiments across four publicly available OpenQA datasets to demonstrate that our approach enhances both retrieval and OpenQA performance compared to baseline models, achieving results comparable to models fine-tuned with human-labeled data.</p></details> |  |

Pleias-RAG-350m and Pleias-RAG-1B are mid-trained on a large synthetic dataset emulating the retrieval of a wide variety of multilingual open sources from the Common Corpus. They provide native support for citation and grounding with literal quotes and reintegrate multiple features associated with RAG workflows, such as query routing, query reformulation, and source reranking. Pleias-RAG-350m and Pleias-RAG-1B outperform SLMs below 4 billion parameters on standardized RAG benchmarks (HotPotQA, 2wiki) and are competitive with popular larger models, including Qwen-2.5-7B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Gemma-3-4B. They are the only SLMs to date maintaining consistent RAG performance across leading European languages and ensuring systematic reference grounding for statements. Due to their size and ease of deployment on constrained infrastructure and higher factuality by design, the models unlock a range of new use cases for generative AI.</p></details> |  |

However, despite the widespread use of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, AI safety work focuses on standard LLMs, which means we know little about how RAG use cases change a model's safety profile. We conduct a detailed comparative analysis of RAG and non-RAG frameworks with eleven LLMs. We find that RAG can make models less safe and change their safety profile. We explore the causes of this change and find that even combinations of safe models with safe documents can cause unsafe generations. In addition, we evaluate some existing red teaming methods for RAG settings and show that they are less effective than when used for non-RAG settings. Our work highlights the need for safety research and red-teaming methods specifically tailored for RAG LLMs.</p></details> | NAACL 2025 |

While many studies focus on evaluating the overall quality of end-to-end RAG systems, there is a gap in understanding the appropriateness of LLMs for the RAG task. To address this, we introduce Trust-Score, a holistic metric that evaluates the trustworthiness of LLMs within the RAG framework. Our results show that various prompting methods, such as in-context learning, fail to effectively adapt LLMs to the RAG task as measured by Trust-Score. Consequently, we propose Trust-Align, a method to align LLMs for improved Trust-Score performance. 26 out of 27 models aligned using Trust-Align substantially outperform competitive baselines on ASQA, QAMPARI, and ELI5. Specifically, in LLaMA-3-8b, Trust-Align outperforms FRONT on ASQA (up 12.56), QAMPARI (up 36.04), and ELI5 (up 17.69). Trust-Align also significantly enhances models' ability to correctly refuse and provide quality citations. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of Trust-Align across different open-weight models, including the LLaMA series (1b to 8b), Qwen-2.5 series (0.5b to 7b), and Phi3.5 (3.8b). We release our code at https://github.com/declare-lab/trust-align.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |

By synergizing retrieval mechanisms with advanced reasoning, LLMs can now tackle increasingly complex problems. This paper presents a systematic review of the collaborative interplay between RAG and reasoning, clearly defining "reasoning" within the RAG context. It construct a comprehensive taxonomy encompassing multi-dimensional collaborative objectives, representative paradigms, and technical implementations, and analyze the bidirectional synergy methods. Additionally, we critically evaluate current limitations in RAG assessment, including the absence of intermediate supervision for multi-step reasoning and practical challenges related to cost-risk trade-offs. To bridge theory and practice, we provide practical guidelines tailored to diverse real-world applications. Finally, we identify promising research directions, such as graph-based knowledge integration, hybrid model collaboration, and RL-driven optimization. Overall, this work presents a theoretical framework and practical foundation to advance RAG systems in academia and industry, fostering the next generation of RAG solutions.</p></details> |  |

As generalized models, LLMs often struggle to provide context-specific information, particularly in areas requiring specialized knowledge. In this work we propose a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based multi-agent LLM system to support analysis and decision-making in the context of natural hazards and extreme weather events. As a proof of concept, we present WildfireGPT, a specialized system focused on wildfire hazards. The architecture employs a user-centered, multi-agent design to deliver tailored risk insights across diverse stakeholder groups. By integrating natural hazard and extreme weather projection data, observational datasets, and scientific literature through an RAG framework, the system ensures both the accuracy and contextual relevance of the information it provides. Evaluation across ten expert-led case studies demonstrates that WildfireGPT significantly outperforms existing LLM-based solutions for decision support.</p></details> |  |

However, fairness and reliability concerns persist, as hallucinations can emerge at both the retrieval and generation stages, affecting users' reasoning and decision-making. Our research explores how tailored warning messages -- whose content depends on the specific context of hallucination -- shape user reasoning and actions in an educational quiz setting. Preliminary findings suggest that while warnings improve accuracy and awareness of high-level hallucinations, they may also introduce cognitive friction, leading to confusion and diminished trust in the system. By examining these interactions, this work contributes to the broader goal of AI-augmented reasoning: developing systems that actively support human reflection, critical thinking, and informed decision-making rather than passive information consumption.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 2025 ACM Workshop on Human-AI Interaction for Augmented Reasoning</p></details> |

However, IFC data can be very complicated because it allows for multiple ways to represent the same product information. In this research, we utilise the capabilities of LLMs to parse the IFC data with Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph-RAG) technique to retrieve building object properties and their relations. We will show that, despite limitations due to the complex hierarchy of the IFC data, the Graph-RAG parsing enhances generative LLMs like GPT-4o with graph-based knowledge, enabling natural language query-response retrieval without the need for a complex pipeline.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 European Conference on Computing in Construction</p></details> |

However, deviations in reasoning paths or errors in intermediate results, which are common in current RAG methods, may propagate and accumulate throughout the reasoning process, diminishing the accuracy of the answer to complex queries. To address this challenge, we propose the Plan-then-Act-and-Review (PAR RAG) framework, which is organized into three key stages: planning, act, and review, and aims to offer an interpretable and incremental reasoning paradigm for accurate and reliable multi-hop question answering by mitigating error propagation.PAR RAG initially applies a top-down problem decomposition strategy, formulating a comprehensive plan that integrates multiple executable steps from a holistic viewpoint. This approach avoids the pitfalls of local optima common in traditional RAG methods, ensuring the accuracy of the entire reasoning path. Subsequently, PAR RAG incorporates a plan execution mechanism based on multi-granularity verification. By utilizing both coarse-grained similarity information and fine-grained relevant data, the framework thoroughly checks and adjusts intermediate results, ensuring process accuracy while effectively managing error propagation and amplification. Experimental results on multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that the PAR RAG framework substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in key metrics, including EM and F1 scores.</p></details> | 18 pages, 3 figures |

Existing methods, which operate at the document level, fail to effectively filter out such content. We propose LLM-driven chunk filtering, ChunkRAG, a framework that enhances RAG systems by evaluating and filtering retrieved information at the chunk level. Our approach employs semantic chunking to divide documents into coherent sections and utilizes LLM-based relevance scoring to assess each chunk's alignment with the user's query. By filtering out less pertinent chunks before the generation phase, we significantly reduce hallucinations and improve factual accuracy. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing RAG models, achieving higher accuracy on tasks requiring precise information retrieval. This advancement enhances the reliability of RAG systems, making them particularly beneficial for applications like fact-checking and multi-hop reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, Student Research Workshop 2025 (NAACL SRW 2025)</p></details> |

To answer this question, we investigate the efficacy of crowdsourcing for RAG through two complementary studies: response writing and response utility judgment. We present the Crowd RAG Corpus 2025 (CrowdRAG-25), which consists of 903 human-written and 903 LLM-generated responses for the 301 topics of the TREC RAG'24 track, across the three discourse styles 'bulleted list', 'essay', and 'news'. For a selection of 65 topics, the corpus further contains 47,320 pairwise human judgments and 10,556 pairwise LLM judgments across seven utility dimensions (e.g., coverage and coherence). Our analyses give insights into human writing behavior for RAG and the viability of crowdsourcing for RAG evaluation. Human pairwise judgments provide reliable and cost-effective results compared to LLM-based pairwise or human/LLM-based pointwise judgments, as well as automated comparisons with human-written reference responses.

RAG systems combine traditional search capabilities with LLMs to generate comprehensive answers to user queries, ideally with accurate citations. However, in our experience of developing a RAG product, LLMs often struggle with source attribution, aligning with other industry studies reporting citation accuracy rates of only about 74% for popular generative search engines. To address this, we present efficient post-processing algorithms to improve citation accuracy in LLM-generated responses, with minimal impact on latency and cost. Our approaches cross-check generated citations against retrieved articles using methods including keyword + semantic matching, fine tuned model with BERTScore, and a lightweight LLM-based technique. Our experimental results demonstrate a relative improvement of 15.46% in the overall accuracy metrics of our RAG system. This significant enhancement potentially enables a shift from our current larger language model to a relatively smaller model that is approximately 12x more cost-effective and 3x faster in inference time, while maintaining comparable performance. This research contributes to enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of AI-generated content in information retrieval and summarization tasks which is critical to gain customer trust especially in commercial products.</p></details> |  |

A crucial factor in RAG evaluation is "support", whether the information in the cited documents supports the answer. To this end, we conducted a large-scale comparative study of 45 participant submissions on 36 topics to the TREC 2024 RAG Track, comparing an automatic LLM judge (GPT-4o) against human judges for support assessment. We considered two conditions: (1) fully manual assessments from scratch and (2) manual assessments with post-editing of LLM predictions. Our results indicate that for 56% of the manual from-scratch assessments, human and GPT-4o predictions match perfectly (on a three-level scale), increasing to 72% in the manual with post-editing condition. Furthermore, by carefully analyzing the disagreements in an unbiased study, we found that an independent human judge correlates better with GPT-4o than a human judge, suggesting that LLM judges can be a reliable alternative for support assessment. To conclude, we provide a qualitative analysis of human and GPT-4o errors to help guide future iterations of support assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGIR 2025 (short)</p></details> |
| **[The Great Nugget Recall: Automating Fact Extraction and RAG Evaluation with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15068v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced the capabilities of information access systems, especially with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Nevertheless, the evaluation of RAG systems remains a barrier to continued progress, a challenge we tackle in this work by proposing an automatic evaluation framework that is validated against human annotations. We believe that the nugget evaluation methodology provides a solid foundation for evaluating RAG systems. This approach, originally developed for the TREC Question Answering (QA) Track in 2003, evaluates systems based on atomic facts that should be present in good answers. Our efforts focus on "refactoring" this methodology, where we describe the AutoNuggetizer framework that specifically applies LLMs to both automatically create nuggets and automatically assign nuggets to system answers. In the context of the TREC 2024 RAG Track, we calibrate a fully automatic approach against strategies where nuggets are created manually or semi-manually by human assessors and then assigned manually to system answers. Based on results from a community-wide evaluation, we observe strong agreement at the run level between scores derived from fully automatic nugget evaluation and human-based variants. The agreement is stronger when individual framework components such as nugget assignment are automated independently. This suggests that our evaluation framework provides tradeoffs between effort and quality that can be used to guide the development of future RAG systems. However, further research is necessary to refine our approach, particularly in establishing robust per-topic agreement to diagnose system failures effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in SIGIR 2025.

| **[AlignRAG: An Adaptable Framework for Resolving Misalignments in Retrieval-Aware Reasoning of RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14858v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a foundational paradigm for knowledge-grounded text generation. However, existing RAG pipelines often fail to ensure that the reasoning trajectories align with the evidential constraints imposed by retrieved content. In this paper, we reframe RAG as a problem of retrieval-aware reasoning and identify a core challenge: reasoning misalignment-the mismatch between a model's reasoning trajectory and the retrieved evidence. To address this challenge, we propose AlignRAG, a novel test-time framework that mitigates reasoning misalignment through iterative Critique-Driven Alignment (CDA) steps. In contrast to prior approaches that rely on static training or post-hoc selection, AlignRAG actively refines reasoning trajectories during inference by enforcing fine-grained alignment with evidence. Our framework introduces a new paradigm for retrieval-aware reasoning by: (1) constructing context-rich training corpora; (2) generating contrastive critiques from preference-aware reasoning trajectories; (3) training a dedicated \textit{Critic Language Model (CLM)} to identify reasoning misalignments; and (4) applying CDA steps to optimize reasoning trajectories iteratively. Empirical results demonstrate that AlignRAG consistently outperforms all baselines and could integrate as a plug-and-play module into existing RAG pipelines without further changes. By reconceptualizing RAG as a structured reasoning trajectory and establishing the test-time framework for correcting reasoning misalignments in RAG, AlignRAG provides practical advancements for retrieval-aware generation.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional vulnerabilities, these packages are intentionally designed to deceive users, making detection challenging due to evolving attack methods and the lack of structured datasets. In this work, we empirically evaluate the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and few-shot learning for detecting malicious source code. We fine-tune LLMs on curated datasets and integrate YARA rules, GitHub Security Advisories, and malicious code snippets with the aim of enhancing classification accuracy. We came across a counterintuitive outcome: While RAG is expected to boost up the prediction performance, it fails in the performed evaluation, obtaining a mediocre accuracy. In contrast, few-shot learning is more effective as it significantly improves the detection of malicious code, achieving 97% accuracy and 95% balanced accuracy, outperforming traditional RAG approaches. Thus, future work should expand structured knowledge bases, refine retrieval models, and explore hybrid AI-driven cybersecurity solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been peer-reviewed and accepted for publication to the 29th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE 2025)</p></details> |

Given a user query, RAG pipelines typically first retrieve (R) relevant information from external sources, before invoking a Large Language Model (LLM), augmented (A) with this information, to generate (G) responses. Modern RAG pipelines frequently chain multiple retrieval and generation components, in any order. However, developing effective RAG pipelines is challenging because retrieval and generation components are intertwined, making it hard to identify which component(s) cause errors in the eventual output. The parameters with the greatest impact on output quality often require hours of pre-processing after each change, creating prohibitively slow feedback cycles. To address these challenges, we present RAGGY, a developer tool that combines a Python library of composable RAG primitives with an interactive interface for real-time debugging. We contribute the design and implementation of RAGGY, insights into expert debugging patterns through a qualitative study with 12 engineers, and design implications for future RAG tools that better align with developers' natural workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

When relevant internal documents are unavailable, the system struggles to generate accurate and complete responses. Additionally, using closed-source Large Language Models (LLMs) raises concerns about exposing proprietary information. To address these issues, we propose the Secure Multifaceted-RAG (SecMulti-RAG) framework, which retrieves not only from internal documents but also from two supplementary sources: pre-generated expert knowledge for anticipated queries and on-demand external LLM-generated knowledge. To mitigate security risks, we adopt a local open-source generator and selectively utilize external LLMs only when prompts are deemed safe by a filtering mechanism. This approach enhances completeness, prevents data leakage, and reduces costs. In our evaluation on a report generation task in the automotive industry, SecMulti-RAG significantly outperforms traditional RAG - achieving 79.3 to 91.9 percent win rates across correctness, richness, and helpfulness in LLM-based evaluation, and 56.3 to 70.4 percent in human evaluation. This highlights SecMulti-RAG as a practical and secure solution for enterprise RAG.</p></details> |  |

However, deploying RAG on consumer-grade platforms is challenging due to limited memory and the increasing scale of both models and knowledge bases. In this work, we introduce RAGDoll, a resource-efficient, self-adaptive RAG serving system integrated with LLMs, specifically designed for resource-constrained platforms. RAGDoll exploits the insight that RAG retrieval and LLM generation impose different computational and memory demands, which in a traditional serial workflow result in substantial idle times and poor resource utilization. Based on this insight, RAGDoll decouples retrieval and generation into parallel pipelines, incorporating joint memory placement and dynamic batch scheduling strategies to optimize resource usage across diverse hardware devices and workloads. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAGDoll adapts effectively to various hardware configurations and LLM scales, achieving up to 3.6 times speedup in average latency compared to serial RAG systems based on vLLM.</p></details> |  |

This advancement has enabled their widespread deployment across sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and enterprise applications. RAG mitigates hallucinations by integrating external knowledge, yet introduces privacy risk and security risk, notably data breaching risk and data poisoning risk. While recent studies have explored prompt injection and poisoning attacks, there remains a significant gap in comprehensive research on controlling inbound and outbound query flows to mitigate these threats. In this paper, we propose an AI firewall, ControlNET, designed to safeguard RAG-based LLM systems from these vulnerabilities. ControlNET controls query flows by leveraging activation shift phenomena to detect adversarial queries and mitigate their impact through semantic divergence. We conduct comprehensive experiments on four different benchmark datasets including Msmarco, HotpotQA, FinQA, and MedicalSys using state-of-the-art open source LLMs (Llama3, Vicuna, and Mistral). Our results demonstrate that ControlNET achieves over 0.909 AUROC in detecting and mitigating security threats while preserving system harmlessness. Overall, ControlNET offers an effective, robust, harmless defense mechanism, marking a significant advancement toward the secure deployment of RAG-based LLM systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://ai.zjuicsr.cn/firewall</p></details> |

However, they also exhibit inherent limitations, such as outdated knowledge and susceptibility to hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm to address these issues, but it also introduces new vulnerabilities. Recent efforts have focused on the security of RAG-based LLMs, yet existing attack methods face three critical challenges: (1) their effectiveness declines sharply when only a limited number of poisoned texts can be injected into the knowledge database, (2) they lack sufficient stealth, as the attacks are often detectable by anomaly detection systems, which compromises their effectiveness, and (3) they rely on heuristic approaches to generate poisoned texts, lacking formal optimization frameworks and theoretic guarantees, which limits their effectiveness and applicability. To address these issues, we propose coordinated Prompt-RAG attack (PR-attack), a novel optimization-driven attack that introduces a small number of poisoned texts into the knowledge database while embedding a backdoor trigger within the prompt. When activated, the trigger causes the LLM to generate pre-designed responses to targeted queries, while maintaining normal behavior in other contexts. This ensures both high effectiveness and stealth. We formulate the attack generation process as a bilevel optimization problem leveraging a principled optimization framework to develop optimal poisoned texts and triggers. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PR-Attack, achieving a high attack success rate even with a limited number of poisoned texts and significantly improved stealth compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

CRs can be exploited for analyzing vulnerabilities and experimenting with the effectiveness of devised countermeasures, as well as serving as training environments for building cyber security skills and abilities for IT operators. This paper proposes ARCeR as an innovative solution for the automatic generation and deployment of CRs, starting from user-provided descriptions in a natural language. ARCeR relies on the Agentic RAG paradigm, which allows it to fully exploit state-of-art AI technologies. Experimental results show that ARCeR is able to successfully process prompts even in cases that LLMs or basic RAG systems are not able to cope with. Furthermore, ARCeR is able to target any CR framework provided that specific knowledge is made available to it.</p></details> |  |

In the retail domain, for example, the identification of fast changing and visually highly similar products and their properties are key to automated price-monitoring and product recommendation. This paper presents a novel Visual RAG pipeline that combines the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach and Vision Language Models (VLMs) for few-shot FGC. This Visual RAG pipeline extracts product and promotion data in advertisement leaflets from various retailers and simultaneously predicts fine-grained product ids along with price and discount information. Compared to previous approaches, the key characteristic of the Visual RAG pipeline is that it allows the prediction of novel products without re-training, simply by adding a few class samples to the RAG database. Comparing several VLM back-ends like GPT-4o [23], GPT-4o-mini [24], and Gemini 2.0 Flash [10], our approach achieves 86.8% accuracy on a diverse dataset.</p></details> |  |

In particular, the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique, which enhances LLM responses by incorporating external knowledge, exacerbates this issue by significantly increasing the number of input tokens. This expansion in token length leads to a substantial rise in computational overhead, particularly during the prefill stage, resulting in prolonged time-to-first-token (TTFT). To address this issue, this paper proposes a method to reduce TTFT by leveraging a disk-based key-value (KV) cache to lessen the computational burden during the prefill stage. We also introduce a disk-based shared KV cache management system, called Shared RAG-DCache, for multi-instance LLM RAG service environments. This system, together with an optimal system configuration, improves both throughput and latency under given resource constraints. Shared RAG-DCache exploits the locality of documents related to user queries in RAG, as well as the queueing delay in LLM inference services. It proactively generates and stores disk KV caches for query-related documents and shares them across multiple LLM instances to enhance inference performance. In experiments on a single host equipped with 2 GPUs and 1 CPU, Shared RAG-DCache achieved a 15~71% increase in throughput and up to a 12~65% reduction in latency, depending on the resource configuration.</p></details> |  |

By exploiting the inherent structure of the corpus, graph-based RAG methods further enrich this process by building a knowledge graph index and leveraging the structural nature of graphs. However, current graph-based RAG approaches seldom prioritize the design of graph structures. Inadequately designed graph not only impede the seamless integration of diverse graph algorithms but also result in workflow inconsistencies and degraded performance. To further unleash the potential of graph for RAG, we propose NodeRAG, a graph-centric framework introducing heterogeneous graph structures that enable the seamless and holistic integration of graph-based methodologies into the RAG workflow. By aligning closely with the capabilities of LLMs, this framework ensures a fully cohesive and efficient end-to-end process. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that NodeRAG exhibits performance advantages over previous methods, including GraphRAG and LightRAG, not only in indexing time, query time, and storage efficiency but also in delivering superior question-answering performance on multi-hop benchmarks and open-ended head-to-head evaluations with minimal retrieval tokens.

| **[Towards Automated Safety Requirements Derivation Using Agent-based RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11243v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the automated derivation of safety requirements in a self-driving vehicle use case, leveraging LLMs in combination with agent-based retrieval-augmented generation. Conventional approaches that utilise pre-trained LLMs to assist in safety analyses typically lack domain-specific knowledge. Existing RAG approaches address this issue, yet their performance deteriorates when handling complex queries and it becomes increasingly harder to retrieve the most relevant information. This is particularly relevant for safety-relevant applications. In this paper, we propose the use of agent-based RAG to derive safety requirements and show that the retrieved information is more relevant to the queries. We implement an agent-based approach on a document pool of automotive standards and the Apollo case study, as a representative example of an automated driving perception system. Our solution is tested on a data set of safety requirement questions and answers, extracted from the Apollo data. Evaluating a set of selected RAG metrics, we present and discuss advantages of a agent-based approach compared to default RAG methods.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |
| **[SlowFastVAD: Video Anomaly Detection via Integrating Simple Detector and RAG-Enhanced Vision-Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10320v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) aims to identify unexpected events in videos and has wide applications in safety-critical domains. While semi-supervised methods trained on only normal samples have gained traction, they often suffer from high false alarm rates and poor interpretability. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong multimodal reasoning capabilities, offering new opportunities for explainable anomaly detection. However, their high computational cost and lack of domain adaptation hinder real-time deployment and reliability. Inspired by dual complementary pathways in human visual perception, we propose SlowFastVAD, a hybrid framework that integrates a fast anomaly detector with a slow anomaly detector (namely a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) enhanced VLM), to address these limitations. Specifically, the fast detector first provides coarse anomaly confidence scores, and only a small subset of ambiguous segments, rather than the entire video, is further analyzed by the slower yet more interpretable VLM for elaborate detection and reasoning. Furthermore, to adapt VLMs to domain-specific VAD scenarios, we construct a knowledge base including normal patterns based on few normal samples and abnormal patterns inferred by VLMs. During inference, relevant patterns are retrieved and used to augment prompts for anomaly reasoning. Finally, we smoothly fuse the anomaly confidence of fast and slow detectors to enhance robustness of anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that SlowFastVAD effectively combines the strengths of both fast and slow detectors, and achieves remarkable detection accuracy and interpretability with significantly reduced computational overhead, making it well-suited for real-world VAD applications with high reliability requirements.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Personalization: From RAG to Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10147v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalization has become an essential capability in modern AI systems, enabling customized interactions that align with individual user preferences, contexts, and goals. Recent research has increasingly concentrated on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks and their evolution into more advanced agent-based architectures within personalized settings to enhance user satisfaction. Building on this foundation, this survey systematically examines personalization across the three core stages of RAG: pre-retrieval, retrieval, and generation. Beyond RAG, we further extend its capabilities into the realm of Personalized LLM-based Agents, which enhance traditional RAG systems with agentic functionalities, including user understanding, personalized planning and execution, and dynamic generation. For both personalization in RAG and agent-based personalization, we provide formal definitions, conduct a comprehensive review of recent literature, and summarize key datasets and evaluation metrics. Additionally, we discuss fundamental challenges, limitations, and promising research directions in this evolving field.

| **[RAG-Based Fuzzing of Cross-Architecture Compilers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08967v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>OneAPI is an open standard that supports cross-architecture software development with minimal effort from developers. It brings DPC++ and C++ compilers which need to be thoroughly tested to verify their correctness, reliability, and security. Compilers have numerous code flows and optimization features. This process requires developers with deep understanding of the different compiler flows to craft testcases specific to target paths in the compiler. This testcase creation is a time-consuming and costly process. In this paper, we propose a large-language model (LLM)-based compiler fuzzing tool that integrates the concept of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). This tool automates the testcase generation task and relieves experienced compiler developers from investing time to craft testcase generation patterns. We test our proposed approach on the Intel DPC++/C++ compiler. This compiler compiles SYCL code and allows developers to offload it to different architectures, e.g. GPUs and CPUs from different vendors. Using this tool, we managed to identify 87 SYCL code test cases that lead to output value mismatch or compiler runtime errors when compiled using Intel DPC++ and clang++ compilers and run on different architectures. The testcases and the identified unexpected behaviors of the compilers under test were obtained within only few hours with no prior background on the compiler passes under tests. This tool facilitates efficient compiler fuzzing with reduced developer time requirements via the dynamic testcase creation capability provided by an LLM with RAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Adaptive Vector Index Partitioning Scheme for Low-Latency RAG Pipeline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08930v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance response quality by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with vector databases, enabling external knowledge retrieval to support language model reasoning. While RAG enables efficient question answering with smaller LLMs, existing optimizations for vector search and LLM serving have largely been developed in isolation. As a result, their integration often leads to suboptimal end-to-end performance. ... This paper introduces VectorLiteRAG, an optimized vector index partitioning mechanism designed for RAG systems that enhances the responsiveness of the system by jointly optimizing vector search and LLM serving across CPU and GPU system. A key challenge is to determine which indices and how much of the vector index should reside on the GPU and adjusting LLM batch sizes to balance the pipeline for lower Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and meeting user-defined Service-Level Objectives (SLOs). To address this, we leverage the insight that cluster access in vector databases exhibits access skew, where a subset of clusters are queried significantly more frequently than others. VectorLiteRAG exploits this property through an optimized memory distribution strategy, dynamically allocating the minimum number of vector indices corresponding to frequently accessed clusters onto the GPU HBM to ensure a balanced pipeline with the LLM for high responsiveness. This adaptive partitioning scheme is guided by a statistical model that informs memory allocation and workload distribution. Our evaluation demonstrates that VectorLiteRAG improves vector search responsiveness by 2x, significantly reduces end-to-end TTFT in RAG systems by intelligently balancing memory resources between vector search and LLM execution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Out of Style: RAG's Fragility to Linguistic Variation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08231v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the impressive performance of Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) systems across various NLP benchmarks, their robustness in handling real-world user-LLM interaction queries remains largely underexplored. This presents a critical gap for practical deployment, where user queries exhibit greater linguistic variations and can trigger cascading errors across interdependent RAG components. In this work, we systematically analyze how varying four linguistic dimensions (formality, readability, politeness, and grammatical correctness) impact RAG performance. We evaluate two retrieval models and nine LLMs, ranging from 3 to 72 billion parameters, across four information-seeking Question Answering (QA) datasets. Our results reveal that linguistic reformulations significantly impact both retrieval and generation stages, leading to a relative performance drop of up to 40.41% in Recall@5 scores for less formal queries and 38.86% in answer match scores for queries containing grammatical errors. Notably, RAG systems exhibit greater sensitivity to such variations compared to LLM-only generations, highlighting their vulnerability to error propagation due to linguistic shifts. These findings highlight the need for improved robustness techniques to enhance reliability in diverse user interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A System for Comprehensive Assessment of RAG Frameworks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07803v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a standard paradigm for enhancing the factual accuracy and contextual relevance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating retrieval mechanisms. However, existing evaluation frameworks fail to provide a holistic black-box approach to assessing RAG systems, especially in real-world deployment scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce SCARF (System for Comprehensive Assessment of RAG Frameworks), a modular and flexible evaluation framework designed to benchmark deployed RAG applications systematically. SCARF provides an end-to-end, black-box evaluation methodology, enabling a limited-effort comparison across diverse RAG frameworks. Our framework supports multiple deployment configurations and facilitates automated testing across vector databases and LLM serving strategies, producing a detailed performance report. Moreover, SCARF integrates practical considerations such as response coherence, providing a scalable and adaptable solution for researchers and industry professionals evaluating RAG applications. Using the REST APIs interface, we demonstrate how SCARF can be applied to real-world scenarios, showcasing its flexibility in assessing different RAG frameworks and configurations.

Given the overwhelming volume and inherent complexity of scientific collections, conventional search systems often lack necessary intuitiveness and interactivity, presenting substantial barriers for learners, educators, and researchers. CollEx addresses these limitations by employing state-of-the-art Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) as multimodal agents accessible through an intuitive chat interface. By abstracting complex interactions via specialized agents equipped with advanced tools, CollEx facilitates curiosity-driven exploration, significantly simplifying access to diverse scientific collections and records therein. Our system integrates textual and visual modalities, supporting educational scenarios that are helpful for teachers, pupils, students, and researchers by fostering independent exploration as well as scientific excitement and curiosity. Furthermore, CollEx serves the research community by discovering interdisciplinary connections and complementing visual data. We illustrate the effectiveness of our system through a proof-of-concept application containing over 64,000 unique records across 32 collections from a local scientific collection from a public university.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging LLMs for Utility-Focused Annotation: Reducing Manual Effort for Retrieval and RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05220v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval models typically rely on costly human-labeled query-document relevance annotations for training and evaluation. To reduce this cost and leverage the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in relevance judgments, we aim to explore whether LLM-generated annotations can effectively replace human annotations in training retrieval models. Retrieval usually emphasizes relevance, which indicates "topic-relatedness" of a document to a query, while in RAG, the value of a document (or utility) depends on how it contributes to answer generation. Recognizing this mismatch, some researchers use LLM performance on downstream tasks with documents as labels, but this approach requires manual answers for specific tasks, leading to high costs and limited generalization. In another line of work, prompting LLMs to select useful documents as RAG references eliminates the need for human annotation and is not task-specific. If we leverage LLMs' utility judgments to annotate retrieval data, we may retain cross-task generalization without human annotation in large-scale corpora. Therefore, we investigate utility-focused annotation via LLMs for large-scale retriever training data across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings on the retrieval and RAG tasks. To reduce the impact of low-quality positives labeled by LLMs, we design a novel loss function, i.e., Disj-InfoNCE. Our experiments reveal that: (1) Retrievers trained on utility-focused annotations significantly outperform those trained on human annotations in the out-of-domain setting on both tasks, demonstrating superior generalization capabilities. (2) LLM annotation does not replace human annotation in the in-domain setting. However, incorporating just 20% human-annotated data enables retrievers trained with utility-focused annotations to match the performance of models trained entirely with human annotations.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Diversity Enhances an LLM's Performance in RAG and Long-context Task](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09017v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the challenge of context window limitations, primarily due to the quadratic time complexity of the self-attention mechanism (\(O(N^2)\), where \(N\) denotes the context window length). This constraint impacts tasks such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in question answering (Q\&A) and long context summarization. A common approach involves selecting content with the highest similarity to the query; however, this often leads to redundancy and the exclusion of diverse yet relevant information. Building on principles from Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) and Farthest Point Sampling (FPS), we integrate diversity into the content selection process. Our findings reveal that incorporating diversity substantially increases the recall of selecting relevant sentences or chunks before LLM-based Q\&A and summarization. These results highlight the importance of maintaining diversity in future LLM applications to further improve summarization and Q\&A outcomes.</p></details> |  |

While hierarchical planning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) address some of these challenges, they remain insufficient on their own and a deeper integration is required for achieving more reliable systems. To this end, we propose a neuro-symbolic approach that enhances LLMs-based planners with Knowledge Graph-based RAG for hierarchical plan generation. This method decomposes complex tasks into manageable subtasks, further expanded into executable atomic action sequences. To ensure formal correctness and proper decomposition, we integrate a Symbolic Validator, which also functions as a failure detector by aligning expected and observed world states. Our evaluation against baseline methods demonstrates the consistent significant advantages of integrating hierarchical planning, symbolic verification, and RAG across tasks of varying complexity and different LLMs. Additionally, our experimental setup and novel metrics not only validate our approach for complex planning but also serve as a tool for assessing LLMs' reasoning and compositional capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Accurate and efficient scenario data search is critical for both online vehicle decision-making and planning, and offline scenario generation and simulations, as it allows for leveraging the scenario experiences to improve the overall performance. Especially with the application of large language models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) systems in autonomous driving, urgent requirements are put forward. In this paper, we introduce the Driving-RAG framework to address the challenges of efficient scenario data embedding, search, and applications for RAG systems. Our embedding model aligns fundamental scenario information and scenario distance metrics in the vector space. The typical scenario sampling method combined with hierarchical navigable small world can perform efficient scenario vector search to achieve high efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. In addition, the reorganization mechanism by graph knowledge enhances the relevance to the prompt scenarios and augment LLM generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on typical trajectory planning task for complex interactive scenarios such as ramps and intersections, showcasing its advantages for RAG applications.</p></details> |  |

Producing such semantic co-speech gestures has been a major challenge for the existing neural systems that can generate rhythmic beat gestures, but struggle to produce semantically meaningful gestures. Therefore, we present RAG-Gesture, a diffusion-based gesture generation approach that leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce natural-looking and semantically rich gestures. Our neuro-explicit gesture generation approach is designed to produce semantic gestures grounded in interpretable linguistic knowledge. We achieve this by using explicit domain knowledge to retrieve exemplar motions from a database of co-speech gestures. Once retrieved, we then inject these semantic exemplar gestures into our diffusion-based gesture generation pipeline using DDIM inversion and retrieval guidance at the inference time without any need of training. Further, we propose a control paradigm for guidance, that allows the users to modulate the amount of influence each retrieval insertion has over the generated sequence. Our comparative evaluations demonstrate the validity of our approach against recent gesture generation approaches.

| **[CacheBlend: Fast Large Language Model Serving for RAG with Cached Knowledge Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16444v3)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often incorporate multiple text chunks in their inputs to provide the necessary contexts. To speed up the prefill of the long LLM inputs, one can pre-compute the KV cache of a text and re-use the KV cache when the context is reused as the prefix of another LLM input. However, the reused text chunks are not always the input prefix, which makes precomputed KV caches not directly usable since they ignore the text's cross-attention with the preceding texts. Thus, the benefits of reusing KV caches remain largely unrealized. This paper tackles just one challenge: when an LLM input contains multiple text chunks, how to quickly combine their precomputed KV caches in order to achieve the same generation quality as the expensive full prefill (i.e., without reusing KV cache)? This challenge naturally arises in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) where the input is supplemented with multiple retrieved texts as the context. We present CacheBlend, a scheme that reuses the precomputed KV caches, regardless prefix or not, and selectively recomputes the KV values of a small subset of tokens to partially update each reused KV cache. In the meantime, the small extra delay for recomputing some tokens can be pipelined with the retrieval of KV caches within the same job, allowing CacheBlend to store KV caches in slower devices with more storage capacity while retrieving them without increasing the inference delay. By comparing CacheBlend with the state-of-the-art KV cache reusing schemes on three open-source LLMs of various sizes and four popular benchmark datasets of different tasks, we show that CacheBlend reduces time-to-first-token (TTFT) by 2.2-3.3x and increases the inference throughput by 2.8-5x from full KV recompute without compromising generation quality.

In real-world scenarios, user questions often require retrieving answers that are distributed across multiple tables. GraphRAG has recently attracted much attention for enhancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities by organizing external knowledge to address ad-hoc and complex questions, exemplifying a promising direction for cross-table question answering. In this paper, to address the current gap in available data, we first introduce a multi-table benchmark, MutliTableQA, comprising 60k tables and 25k user queries collected from real-world sources. Then, we propose the first Graph-Table-RAG framework, namely GTR, which reorganizes table corpora into a heterogeneous graph, employs a hierarchical coarse-to-fine retrieval process to extract the most relevant tables, and integrates graph-aware prompting for downstream LLMs' tabular reasoning. Extensive experiments show that GTR exhibits superior cross-table question-answering performance while maintaining high deployment efficiency, demonstrating its real-world practical applicability.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |

Large language models (LLMs) have made it significantly easier to prototype such retrieval and reasoning data pipelines. However, implementing these pipelines efficiently still demands significant effort and has several challenges. This often involves orchestrating heterogeneous data systems, managing data movement, and handling low-level implementation details, e.g., LLM context management. To address these challenges, we introduce FlockMTL: an extension for DBMSs that deeply integrates LLM capabilities and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). FlockMTL includes model-driven scalar and aggregate functions, enabling chained predictions through tuple-level mappings and reductions. Drawing inspiration from the relational model, FlockMTL incorporates: (i) cost-based optimizations, which seamlessly apply techniques such as batching and caching; and (ii) resource independence, enabled through novel SQL DDL abstractions: PROMPT and MODEL, introduced as first-class schema objects alongside TABLE. FlockMTL streamlines the development of knowledge-intensive analytical applications, and its optimizations ease the implementation burden.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Routing RAG: Binding Selective Retrieval with Knowledge Verbalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01018v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Selective retrieval improves retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by reducing distractions from low-quality retrievals and improving efficiency. However, existing approaches under-utilize the inherent knowledge of large language models (LLMs), leading to suboptimal retrieval decisions and degraded generation performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Self-Routing RAG (SR-RAG), a novel framework that binds selective retrieval with knowledge verbalization. SR-RAG enables an LLM to dynamically decide between external retrieval and verbalizing its own parametric knowledge. To this end, we design a multi-task objective that jointly optimizes an LLM on knowledge source selection, knowledge verbalization, and response generation. We further introduce dynamic knowledge source inference via nearest neighbor search to improve the accuracy of knowledge source decision under domain shifts. Fine-tuning three LLMs with SR-RAG significantly improves both their response accuracy and inference latency. Compared to the strongest selective retrieval baseline, SR-RAG reduces retrievals by 29% while improving the performance by 5.1%.</p></details> | Work in Progress |

RAG primarily relies on the query-chunk text-to-text similarity in the embedding space for retrieval and can fail to capture deeper semantic relationships across chunks, is highly sensitive to chunking strategies, and is prone to hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose TOBUGraph, a graph-based retrieval framework that first constructs the knowledge graph from unstructured data dynamically and automatically. Using LLMs, TOBUGraph extracts structured knowledge and diverse relationships among data, going beyond RAG's text-to-text similarity. Retrieval is achieved through graph traversal, leveraging the extracted relationships and structures to enhance retrieval accuracy, eliminating the need for chunking configurations while reducing hallucination. We demonstrate TOBUGraph's effectiveness in TOBU, a real-world application in production for personal memory organization and retrieval. Our evaluation using real user data demonstrates that TOBUGraph outperforms multiple RAG implementations in both precision and recall, significantly improving user experience through improved retrieval accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contradiction Detection in RAG Systems: Evaluating LLMs as Context Validators for Improved Information Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00180v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have emerged as a powerful method for enhancing large language models (LLMs) with up-to-date information. However, the retrieval step in RAG can sometimes surface documents containing contradictory information, particularly in rapidly evolving domains such as news. These contradictions can significantly impact the performance of LLMs, leading to inconsistent or erroneous outputs. This study addresses this critical challenge in two ways. First, we present a novel data generation framework to simulate different types of contradictions that may occur in the retrieval stage of a RAG system. Second, we evaluate the robustness of different LLMs in performing as context validators, assessing their ability to detect contradictory information within retrieved document sets. Our experimental results reveal that context validation remains a challenging task even for state-of-the-art LLMs, with performance varying significantly across different types of contradictions. While larger models generally perform better at contradiction detection, the effectiveness of different prompting strategies varies across tasks and model architectures. We find that chain-of-thought prompting shows notable improvements for some models but may hinder performance in others, highlighting the complexity of the task and the need for more robust approaches to context validation in RAG systems.</p></details> |  |

Fine-tuning achieves the highest accuracy (91% for emotion classification, 80% for mental health conditions) but requires substantial computational resources and large training sets, while prompt engineering and RAG offer more flexible deployment with moderate performance (40-68% accuracy). Our findings provide practical insights for implementing LLM-based solutions in mental health applications, highlighting the trade-offs between accuracy, computational requirements, and deployment flexibility.</p></details> |  |

A robust benchmark dataset must satisfy three key criteria: quality, diversity, and difficulty, which capturing the complexity of reasoning based on hops and the distribution of supporting evidence. In this paper, we propose MHTS (Multi-Hop Tree Structure), a novel dataset synthesis framework that systematically controls multi-hop reasoning complexity by leveraging a multi-hop tree structure to generate logically connected, multi-chunk queries. Our fine-grained difficulty estimation formula exhibits a strong correlation with the overall performance metrics of a RAG system, validating its effectiveness in assessing both retrieval and answer generation capabilities. By ensuring high-quality, diverse, and difficulty-controlled queries, our approach enhances RAG evaluation and benchmarking capabilities.</p></details> |  |

To recover from retriever failures, domain knowledge is injected by fine-tuning the model to generate the correct response, even in the case of retrieval errors. However, we observe that without systematic knowledge augmentation, fine-tuned LLMs may memorize new information but still fail to extract relevant domain knowledge, leading to poor performance. In this work, we present a novel framework that significantly enhances the fine-tuning process by augmenting the training data in two ways -- context augmentation and knowledge paraphrasing. In context augmentation, we create multiple training samples for a given QA pair by varying the relevance of the retrieved information, teaching the model when to ignore and when to rely on retrieved content. In knowledge paraphrasing, we fine-tune with multiple answers to the same question, enabling LLMs to better internalize specialized knowledge. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting due to fine-tuning, we add a domain-specific identifier to a question and also utilize a replay buffer containing general QA pairs. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our method over existing techniques, achieving up to 10\% relative gain in token-level recall while preserving the LLM's generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 14 tables, to be published in NAACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[Does RAG Introduce Unfairness in LLMs? Evaluating Fairness in Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19804v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has recently gained significant attention for its enhanced ability to integrate external knowledge sources into open-domain question answering (QA) tasks. However, it remains unclear how these models address fairness concerns, particularly with respect to sensitive attributes such as gender, geographic location, and other demographic factors. First, as language models evolve to prioritize utility, like improving exact match accuracy, fairness considerations may have been largely overlooked. Second, the complex, multi-component architecture of RAG methods poses challenges in identifying and mitigating biases, as each component is optimized for distinct objectives. In this paper, we aim to empirically evaluate fairness in several RAG methods. We propose a fairness evaluation framework tailored to RAG, using scenario-based questions and analyzing disparities across demographic attributes. Our experimental results indicate that, despite recent advances in utility-driven optimization, fairness issues persist in both the retrieval and generation stages. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions to address fairness concerns throughout the RAG pipeline. The dataset and code used in this study are publicly available at this GitHub Repository https://github.com/elviswxy/RAG_fairness .</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at COLING 2025</p></details> |
| **[Improving RAG for Personalization with Author Features and Contrastive Examples](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08745v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalization with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) often fails to capture fine-grained features of authors, making it hard to identify their unique traits. To enrich the RAG context, we propose providing Large Language Models (LLMs) with author-specific features, such as average sentiment polarity and frequently used words, in addition to past samples from the author's profile. We introduce a new feature called Contrastive Examples: documents from other authors are retrieved to help LLM identify what makes an author's style unique in comparison to others. Our experiments show that adding a couple of sentences about the named entities, dependency patterns, and words a person uses frequently significantly improves personalized text generation. Combining features with contrastive examples boosts the performance further, achieving a relative 15% improvement over baseline RAG while outperforming the benchmarks. Our results show the value of fine-grained features for better personalization, while opening a new research dimension for including contrastive examples as a complement with RAG. We release our code publicly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Balancing Content Size in RAG-Text2SQL System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15723v3)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising solution for converting natural language queries into SQL commands, enabling seamless database interaction. However, these Text-to-SQL (Text2SQL) systems face inherent limitations, hallucinations, outdated knowledge, and untraceable reasoning. To address these challenges, the integration of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with Text2SQL models has gained traction. RAG serves as a retrieval mechanism, providing essential contextual information, such as table schemas and metadata, to enhance the query generation process. Despite their potential, RAG + Text2SQL systems are susceptible to the quality and size of retrieved documents. While richer document content can improve schema relevance and retrieval accuracy, it also introduces noise, increasing the risk of hallucinations and reducing query fidelity as the prompt size of the Text2SQL model increases. This research investigates the nuanced trade-off between document size and quality, aiming to strike a balance that optimizes system performance. Key thresholds are identified where performance degradation occurs, along with actionable strategies to mitigate these challenges. Additionally, we explore the phenomenon of hallucinations in Text2SQL models, emphasizing the critical role of curated document presentation in minimizing errors. Our findings provide a roadmap for enhancing the robustness of RAG + Text2SQL systems, offering practical insights for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[ExpertRAG: Efficient RAG with Mixture of Experts -- Optimizing Context Retrieval for Adaptive LLM Responses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08744v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>ExpertRAG is a novel theoretical framework that integrates Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to advance the efficiency and accuracy of knowledge-intensive language modeling. We propose a dynamic retrieval gating mechanism coupled with expert routing, enabling the model to selectively consult an external knowledge store or rely on specialized internal experts based on the query's needs. The paper lays out the theoretical foundations of ExpertRAG, including a probabilistic formulation that treats retrieval and expert selection as latent decisions, and mathematical justifications for its efficiency in both computation and knowledge utilization. We derive formulae to quantify the expected computational cost savings from selective retrieval and the capacity gains from sparse expert utilization. A comparative analysis positions ExpertRAG against standard RAG (with always-on retrieval) and pure MoE models (e.g., Switch Transformer, Mixtral) to highlight its unique balance between parametric knowledge and non-parametric retrieval. We also outline an experimental validation strategy, proposing benchmarks and evaluation protocols to test ExpertRAG's performance on factual recall, generalization, and inference efficiency. The proposed framework, although presented theoretically, is supported by insights from prior work in RAG and MoE, and is poised to provide more factual, efficient, and adaptive generation by leveraging the best of both paradigms. In summary, ExpertRAG contributes a new perspective on scaling and augmenting language models, backed by a thorough analysis and a roadmap for empirical validation.</p></details> | 30 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Tuning LLMs by RAG Principles: Towards LLM-native Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16071v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Memory, additional information beyond the training of large language models (LLMs), is crucial to various real-world applications, such as personal assistant. The two mainstream solutions to incorporate memory into the generation process are long-context LLMs and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). In this paper, we first systematically compare these two types of solutions on three renovated/new datasets and show that (1) long-context solutions, although more expensive, shall be easier to capture the big picture and better answer queries which require considering the memory as a whole; and (2) when the queries concern specific information, RAG solutions shall be more competitive especially when the keywords can be explicitly matched. Therefore, we propose a novel method RAG-Tuned-LLM which fine-tunes a relative small (e.g., 7B) LLM using the data generated following the RAG principles, so it can combine the advantages of both solutions. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that RAG-Tuned-LLM can beat long-context LLMs and RAG methods across a wide range of query types.</p></details> |  |

This section serves as a valuable resource for early-career researchers seeking unexplored areas and experienced researchers looking for new projects or collaborations. In this study, we generate future work suggestions from key sections of a scientific article alongside related papers and analyze how the trends have evolved. We experimented with various Large Language Models (LLMs) and integrated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance the generation process. We incorporate a LLM feedback mechanism to improve the quality of the generated content and propose an LLM-as-a-judge approach for evaluation.

The recent purposed Mixed-Precision Over-the-Air Federated Learning (MP-OTA-FL) enables clients to operate at appropriate precision levels based on their heterogeneous hardware, taking advantages of the larger trade-off space while covering the quantization overheads in the mixed-precision modulation scheme for the OTA aggregation process. A key to further exploring the potential of the MP-OTA-FL framework is the optimization of client precision levels. The choice of precision level hinges on multifaceted factors including hardware capability, potential client contribution, and user satisfaction, among which factors can be difficult to define or quantify. In this paper, we propose a RAG-based User Profiling for precision planning framework that integrates retrieval-augmented LLMs and dynamic client profiling to optimize satisfaction and contributions. This includes a hybrid interface for gathering device/user insights and an RAG database storing historical quantization decisions with feedback. Experiments show that our method boosts satisfaction, energy savings, and global model accuracy in MP-OTA-FL systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, submitted to IEEE VTC 2025 fall for possible publication</p></details> |

Chatbots as question-answering systems can help in solving these challenges. LLM chatbots use NLP techniques to establish connections between topics and accurately respond to complex questions. These capabilities make it perfect for enlightenment on religion as a question-answering chatbot. However, LLMs also tend to generate false information, known as hallucination. Also, the chatbots' responses can include content that insults personal religious beliefs, interfaith conflicts, and controversial or sensitive topics. It must avoid such cases without promoting hate speech or offending certain groups of people or their beliefs. This study uses a vector database-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to enhance the accuracy and transparency of LLMs. Our question-answering system is called "MufassirQAS". We created a database consisting of several open-access books that include Turkish context. These books contain Turkish translations and interpretations of Islam. This database is utilized to answer religion-related questions and ensure our answers are trustworthy. The relevant part of the dataset, which LLM also uses, is presented along with the answer. We have put careful effort into creating system prompts that give instructions to prevent harmful, offensive, or disrespectful responses to respect people's values and provide reliable results. The system answers and shares additional information, such as the page number from the respective book and the articles referenced for obtaining the information. MufassirQAS and ChatGPT are also tested with sensitive questions. We got better performance with our system. Study and enhancements are still in progress. Results and future works are given.</p></details> |  |
| **[SOSecure: Safer Code Generation with RAG and StackOverflow Discussions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13654v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for automated code generation. Their reliance on infrequently updated pretraining data leaves them unaware of newly discovered vulnerabilities and evolving security standards, making them prone to producing insecure code. In contrast, developer communities on Stack Overflow (SO) provide an ever-evolving repository of knowledge, where security vulnerabilities are actively discussed and addressed through collective expertise. These community-driven insights remain largely untapped by LLMs. This paper introduces SOSecure, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that leverages the collective security expertise found in SO discussions to improve the security of LLM-generated code. We build a security-focused knowledge base by extracting SO answers and comments that explicitly identify vulnerabilities. Unlike common uses of RAG, SOSecure triggers after code has been generated to find discussions that identify flaws in similar code. These are used in a prompt to an LLM to consider revising the code. Evaluation across three datasets (SALLM, LLMSecEval, and LMSys) show that SOSecure achieves strong fix rates of 71.7%, 91.3%, and 96.7% respectively, compared to prompting GPT-4 without relevant discussions (49.1%, 56.5%, and 37.5%), and outperforms multiple other baselines. SOSecure operates as a language-agnostic complement to existing LLMs, without requiring retraining or fine-tuning, making it easy to deploy. Our results underscore the importance of maintaining active developer forums, which have dropped substantially in usage with LLM adoptions.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we proposed MES-RAG framework, which enhances entity-specific query handling and provides accurate, secure, and consistent responses. MES-RAG introduces proactive security measures that ensure system integrity by applying protections prior to data access. Additionally, the system supports real-time multi-modal outputs, including text, images, audio, and video, seamlessly integrating into existing RAG architectures. Experimental results demonstrate that MES-RAG significantly improves both accuracy and recall, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing the security and utility of question-answering, increasing accuracy to 0.83 (+0.25) on targeted task.

| **[Privacy-Aware RAG: Secure and Isolated Knowledge Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15548v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in real-world applications has heightened concerns about the confidentiality and integrity of their proprietary knowledge bases. These knowledge bases, which play a critical role in enhancing the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly vulnerable to breaches that could compromise sensitive information. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an advanced encryption methodology designed to protect RAG systems from unauthorized access and data leakage. Our approach encrypts both textual content and its corresponding embeddings prior to storage, ensuring that all data remains securely encrypted. This mechanism restricts access to authorized entities with the appropriate decryption keys, thereby significantly reducing the risk of unintended data exposure. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our encryption strategy preserves the performance and functionality of RAG pipelines, ensuring compatibility across diverse domains and applications. To validate the robustness of our method, we provide comprehensive security proofs that highlight its resilience against potential threats and vulnerabilities. These proofs also reveal limitations in existing approaches, which often lack robustness, adaptability, or reliance on open-source models. Our findings suggest that integrating advanced encryption techniques into the design and deployment of RAG systems can effectively enhance privacy safeguards. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on improving security measures for AI-driven services and advocates for stricter data protection standards within RAG architectures.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advancements, LLMs still face significant challenges in reasoning with structured data, handling dynamic knowledge evolution, and mitigating hallucinations, particularly in mission-critical domains. Our proposed RAG-KG-IL framework addresses these limitations by employing a multi-agent architecture that enables continuous knowledge updates, integrates structured knowledge, and incorporates autonomous agents for enhanced explainability and reasoning. The framework utilizes RAG to ensure the generated responses are grounded in verifiable information, while KGs provide structured domain knowledge for improved consistency and depth of understanding. The Incremental Learning approach allows for dynamic updates to the knowledge base without full retraining, significantly reducing computational overhead and improving the model's adaptability. We evaluate the framework using real-world case studies involving health-related queries, comparing it to state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o and a RAG-only baseline. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces hallucination rates and improves answer completeness and reasoning accuracy. The results underscore the potential of combining RAG, KGs, and multi-agent systems to create intelligent, adaptable systems capable of real-time knowledge integration and reasoning in complex domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Relevance Isn't All You Need: Scaling RAG Systems With Inference-Time Compute Via Multi-Criteria Reranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07104v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern Large Language Model (LLM) systems typically rely on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) which aims to gather context that is useful for response generation. These RAG systems typically optimize strictly towards retrieving context that is maximally relevant to the query. However, conventional theory suggests that retrieval systems which seek to maximize context relevance without any additional explicit criteria can create information bottlenecks. We reaffirm this finding in the modern age of LLM's by showing that in standard RAG pipelines, maximizing for context relevance alone can degrade downstream response quality. In response, we show evaluations of existing RAG methods which account for both context relevance and answer quality. These evaluations introduce a novel finding that existing RAG systems scale poorly with inference time compute usage when considering our combined metric. We introduce "RErank BEyond reLevance (REBEL)", which enables RAG systems to scale with inference-time compute via injection of multi-criteria optimization using Chain-of-Thought prompting (and optionally Multi-Turn dialogue). Ultimately, this enables a new performance/speed tradeoff curve, where RAG systems are able to achieve both higher relevance of retrieved contexts and superior answer quality as inference time increases. Code for the implementation of our method in llama-index can be found at the following PR: https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/pull/17590. Code for running experiments using this llama-index implementation can be found at https://github.com/microsoft/REBEL.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional AI pipelines based on deep neural visual architectures such as CNNs or ViTs face limitations such as degraded performance on the long-tail of classes and the inability to reason about their predictions. We integrate image captioning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) to enhance biodiversity monitoring, showing particular promise for characterizing rare and unknown arthropod species. While a naive Vision-Language Model (VLM) excels in classifying images of common species, the RAG model enables classification of rarer taxa by matching explicit textual descriptions of taxonomic features to contextual biodiversity text data from external sources. The RAG model shows promise in reducing overconfidence and enhancing accuracy relative to naive LLMs, suggesting its viability in capturing the nuances of taxonomic hierarchy, particularly at the challenging family and genus levels. Our findings highlight the potential for modern vision-language AI pipelines to support biodiversity conservation initiatives, emphasizing the role of comprehensive data curation and collaboration with citizen science platforms to improve species identification, unknown species characterization and ultimately inform conservation strategies.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |

In the Query-Focused Summarization (QFS) task, GraphRAG-based approaches have notably enhanced the comprehensiveness and diversity of generated responses. However, existing GraphRAG-based approaches predominantly focus on coarse-grained information summarization without being aware of the specific query, and the retrieved content lacks sufficient contextual information to generate comprehensive responses. To address the deficiencies of current RAG systems, we propose Context-Aware Fine-Grained Graph RAG (FG-RAG) to enhance the performance of the QFS task. FG-RAG employs Context-Aware Entity Expansion in graph retrieval to expand the coverage of retrieved entities in the graph, thus providing enough contextual information for the retrieved content. Furthermore, FG-RAG utilizes Query-Level Fine-Grained Summarization to incorporate fine-grained details during response generation, enhancing query awareness for the generated summarization. Our evaluation demonstrates that FG-RAG outperforms other RAG systems in multiple metrics of comprehensiveness, diversity, and empowerment when handling the QFS task. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/BuptWululu/FG-RAG.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces ClaimTrust, a propagation-based trust scoring framework that dynamically evaluates the reliability of documents in a RAG system. Using a modified PageRank-inspired algorithm, ClaimTrust propagates trust scores across documents based on relationships derived from extracted factual claims. We preprocess and analyze 814 political news articles from Kaggle's Fake News Detection Dataset to extract 2,173 unique claims and classify 965 meaningful relationships (supporting or contradicting). By representing the dataset as a document graph, ClaimTrust iteratively updates trust scores until convergence, effectively differentiating trustworthy articles from unreliable ones. Our methodology, which leverages embedding-based filtering for efficient claim comparison and relationship classification, achieves a 11.2% of significant connections while maintaining computational scalability. Experimental results demonstrate that ClaimTrust successfully assigns higher trust scores to verified documents while penalizing those containing false information. Future directions include fine-tuned claim extract and compare (Li et al., 2022), parameter optimization, enhanced language model utilization, and robust evaluation metrics to generalize the framework across diverse datasets and domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

To effectively assess their video comprehension capabilities, long video understanding benchmarks, such as Video-MME and MLVU, are proposed. However, these benchmarks directly use uniform frame sampling for testing, which results in significant information loss and affects the accuracy of the evaluations in reflecting the true abilities of MLLMs. To address this, we propose RAG-Adapter, a plug-and-play framework that reduces information loss during testing by sampling frames most relevant to the given question. Additionally, we introduce a Grouped-supervised Contrastive Learning (GCL) method to further enhance sampling effectiveness of RAG-Adapter through fine-tuning on our constructed MMAT dataset. Finally, we test numerous baseline MLLMs on various video understanding benchmarks, finding that RAG-Adapter sampling consistently outperforms uniform sampling (e.g., Accuracy of GPT-4o increases by 9.3 percent on Video-MME), providing a more accurate testing method for long video benchmarks.</p></details> | 37 pages, 36 figures |

Predictive maintenance (PdM) in such settings demands methodologies that are adaptive, transferable, and capable of integrating domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we present RAAD-LLM, a novel framework for adaptive anomaly detection, leveraging large language models (LLMs) integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This approach addresses the aforementioned PdM challenges. By effectively utilizing domain-specific knowledge, RAAD-LLM enhances the detection of anomalies in time series data without requiring fine-tuning on specific datasets. The framework's adaptability mechanism enables it to adjust its understanding of normal operating conditions dynamically, thus increasing detection accuracy. We validate this methodology through a real-world application for a plastics manufacturing plant and the Skoltech Anomaly Benchmark (SKAB). Results show significant improvements over our previous model with an accuracy increase from 70.7% to 88.6% on the real-world dataset. By allowing for the enriching of input series data with semantics, RAAD-LLM incorporates multimodal capabilities that facilitate more collaborative decision-making between the model and plant operators. Overall, our findings support RAAD-LLM's ability to revolutionize anomaly detection methodologies in PdM, potentially leading to a paradigm shift in how anomaly detection is implemented across various industries.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2411.00914</p></details> |

To bridge this gap, we introduce OpenRAG, a RAG framework that is optimized end-to-end by tuning the retriever to capture in-context relevance, enabling adaptation to the diverse and evolving needs. Extensive experiments across a wide range of tasks demonstrate that OpenRAG, by tuning a retriever end-to-end, leads to a consistent improvement of 4.0% over the original retriever, consistently outperforming existing state-of-the-art retrievers by 2.1%. Additionally, our results indicate that for some tasks, an end-to-end tuned 0.2B retriever can achieve improvements that surpass those of RAG-oriented or instruction-tuned 8B large language models (LLMs), highlighting the cost-effectiveness of our approach in enhancing RAG systems.</p></details> |  |

As an essential part of RAG, external knowledge bases are commonly built by extracting structured data from unstructured PDF documents using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However, given the imperfect prediction of OCR and the inherent non-uniform representation of structured data, knowledge bases inevitably contain various OCR noises. In this paper, we introduce OHRBench, the first benchmark for understanding the cascading impact of OCR on RAG systems. OHRBench includes 8,561 carefully selected unstructured document images from seven real-world RAG application domains, along with 8,498 Q&A pairs derived from multimodal elements in documents, challenging existing OCR solutions used for RAG. To better understand OCR's impact on RAG systems, we identify two primary types of OCR noise: Semantic Noise and Formatting Noise and apply perturbation to generate a set of structured data with varying degrees of each OCR noise. Using OHRBench, we first conduct a comprehensive evaluation of current OCR solutions and reveal that none is competent for constructing high-quality knowledge bases for RAG systems. We then systematically evaluate the impact of these two noise types and demonstrate the trend relationship between the degree of OCR noise and RAG performance. Our OHRBench, including PDF documents, Q&As, and the ground truth structured data are released at: https://github.com/opendatalab/OHR-Bench</p></details> | Work in progress |

We demonstrate that RAG systems that operate on databases with untrusted content are vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks we call jamming. An adversary can add a single ``blocker'' document to the database that will be retrieved in response to a specific query and result in the RAG system not answering this query, ostensibly because it lacks relevant information or because the answer is unsafe. We describe and measure the efficacy of several methods for generating blocker documents, including a new method based on black-box optimization. Our method (1) does not rely on instruction injection, (2) does not require the adversary to know the embedding or LLM used by the target RAG system, and (3) does not employ an auxiliary LLM. We evaluate jamming attacks on several embeddings and LLMs and demonstrate that the existing safety metrics for LLMs do not capture their vulnerability to jamming. We then discuss defenses against blocker documents.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in USENIX Security Symposium 2025</p></details> |

However, the specialized nature of biochemical data often necessitates costly domain-specific fine-tuning, posing critical challenges. First, it hinders the application of more flexible general-purpose LLMs in cutting-edge drug discovery tasks. More importantly, it impedes the rapid integration of the vast amounts of scientific data continuously generated through experiments and research. To investigate these challenges, we propose CLADD, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-empowered agentic system tailored to drug discovery tasks. Through the collaboration of multiple LLM agents, CLADD dynamically retrieves information from biomedical knowledge bases, contextualizes query molecules, and integrates relevant evidence to generate responses -- all without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. Crucially, we tackle key obstacles in applying RAG workflows to biochemical data, including data heterogeneity, ambiguity, and multi-source integration. We demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of this framework across a variety of drug discovery tasks, showing that it outperforms general-purpose and domain-specific LLMs as well as traditional deep learning approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Machi...</summary><p>Machine Learning, Drug Discovery</p></details> |

However, these modules are usually separately trained. We argue that a system like RAG that incorporates multiple modules should be jointly optimized to achieve optimal performance. To demonstrate this, we design a specific pipeline called \textbf{SmartRAG} that includes a policy network and a retriever. The policy network can serve as 1) a decision maker that decides when to retrieve, 2) a query rewriter to generate a query most suited to the retriever, and 3) an answer generator that produces the final response with/without the observations. We then propose to jointly optimize the whole system using a reinforcement learning algorithm, with the reward designed to encourage the system to achieve the best performance with minimal retrieval cost. When jointly optimized, all the modules can be aware of how other modules are working and thus find the best way to work together as a complete system. Empirical results demonstrate that the jointly optimized SmartRAG can achieve better performance than separately optimized counterparts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human Cognition Inspired RAG with Knowledge Graph for Complex Problem Solving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06567v1)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential across various domains, yet they face significant challenges in knowledge integration and complex problem reasoning, often leading to hallucinations and unreliable outputs. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution to enhance LLMs accuracy by incorporating external knowledge. However, traditional RAG systems struggle with processing complex relational information and multi-step reasoning, limiting their effectiveness in advanced problem-solving tasks. To address these limitations, we propose CogGRAG, a cognition inspired graph-based RAG framework, designed to improve LLMs performance in Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA). Inspired by the human cognitive process of decomposing complex problems and performing self-verification, our framework introduces a three-stage methodology: decomposition, retrieval, and reasoning with self-verification. By integrating these components, CogGRAG enhances the accuracy of LLMs in complex problem solving. We conduct systematic experiments with three LLM backbones on four benchmark datasets, where CogGRAG outperforms the baselines.</p></details> |  |

While RAG enhances MLLMs by grounding responses in query-relevant external knowledge, this reliance poses a critical yet underexplored safety risk: knowledge poisoning attacks, where misinformation or irrelevant knowledge is intentionally injected into external knowledge bases to manipulate model outputs to be incorrect and even harmful. To expose such vulnerabilities in multimodal RAG, we propose MM-PoisonRAG, a novel knowledge poisoning attack framework with two attack strategies: Localized Poisoning Attack (LPA), which injects query-specific misinformation in both text and images for targeted manipulation, and Globalized Poisoning Attack (GPA) to provide false guidance during MLLM generation to elicit nonsensical responses across all queries. We evaluate our attacks across multiple tasks, models, and access settings, demonstrating that LPA successfully manipulates the MLLM to generate attacker-controlled answers, with a success rate of up to 56% on MultiModalQA. Moreover, GPA completely disrupts model generation to 0% accuracy with just a single irrelevant knowledge injection. Our results highlight the urgent need for robust defenses against knowledge poisoning to safeguard multimodal RAG frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/HyeonjeongHa/MM-PoisonRAG</p></details> |
| **[Improving RAG Retrieval via Propositional Content Extraction: a Speech Act Theory Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10654v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When users formulate queries, they often include not only the information they seek, but also pragmatic markers such as interrogative phrasing or polite requests. Although these speech act indicators communicate the user\textquotesingle s intent -- whether it is asking a question, making a request, or stating a fact -- they do not necessarily add to the core informational content of the query itself. This paper investigates whether extracting the underlying propositional content from user utterances -- essentially stripping away the linguistic markers of intent -- can improve retrieval quality in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Drawing upon foundational insights from speech act theory, we propose a practical method for automatically transforming queries into their propositional equivalents before embedding. To assess the efficacy of this approach, we conducted an experimental study involving 63 user queries related to a Brazilian telecommunications news corpus with precomputed semantic embeddings. Results demonstrate clear improvements in semantic similarity between query embeddings and document embeddings at top ranks, confirming that queries stripped of speech act indicators more effectively retrieve relevant content.</p></details> | 19 pages, 4 figures |

Built from heterologous data of NASDAQ 100 companies, FinTMMBench offers three significant advantages. 1) Multi-modal Corpus: It encompasses a hybrid of financial tables, news articles, daily stock prices, and visual technical charts as the corpus. 2) Temporal-aware Questions: Each question requires the retrieval and interpretation of its relevant data over a specific time period, including daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual periods. 3) Diverse Financial Analysis Tasks: The questions involve 10 different tasks, including information extraction, trend analysis, sentiment analysis and event detection, etc. We further propose a novel TMMHybridRAG method, which first leverages LLMs to convert data from other modalities (e.g., tabular, visual and time-series data) into textual format and then incorporates temporal information in each node when constructing graphs and dense indexes. Its effectiveness has been validated in extensive experiments, but notable gaps remain, highlighting the challenges presented by our FinTMMBench.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Beyond RAG: Task-Aware KV Cache Compression for Comprehensive Knowledge Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04973v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incorporating external knowledge in large language models (LLMs) enhances their utility across diverse applications, but existing methods have trade-offs. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) fetches evidence via similarity search, but key information may fall outside top ranked results. Long-context models can process multiple documents but are computationally expensive and limited by context window size. Inspired by students condensing study material for open-book exams, we propose task-aware key-value (KV) cache compression, which compresses external knowledge in a zero- or few-shot setup. This enables LLMs to reason efficiently over a compacted representation of all relevant information. Experiments show our approach outperforms both RAG and task-agnostic compression methods. On LongBench v2, it improves accuracy by up to 7 absolute points over RAG with a 30x compression rate, while reducing inference latency from 0.43s to 0.16s. A synthetic dataset highlights that RAG performs well when sparse evidence suffices, whereas task-aware compression is superior for broad knowledge tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[More Documents, Same Length: Isolating the Challenge of Multiple Documents in RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04388v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) provides LLMs with relevant documents. Although previous studies noted that retrieving many documents can degrade performance, they did not isolate how the quantity of documents affects performance while controlling for context length. We evaluate various language models on custom datasets derived from a multi-hop QA task. We keep the context length and position of relevant information constant while varying the number of documents, and find that increasing the document count in RAG settings poses significant challenges for LLMs. Additionally, our results indicate that processing multiple documents is a separate challenge from handling long contexts. We also make the datasets and code available: https://github.com/shaharl6000/MoreDocsSameLen .</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[In-depth Analysis of Graph-based RAG in a Unified Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04338v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has proven effective in integrating external knowledge into large language models (LLMs), improving their factual accuracy, adaptability, interpretability, and trustworthiness. A number of graph-based RAG methods have been proposed in the literature. However, these methods have not been systematically and comprehensively compared under the same experimental settings. In this paper, we first summarize a unified framework to incorporate all graph-based RAG methods from a high-level perspective. We then extensively compare representative graph-based RAG methods over a range of questing-answering (QA) datasets -- from specific questions to abstract questions -- and examine the effectiveness of all methods, providing a thorough analysis of graph-based RAG approaches. As a byproduct of our experimental analysis, we are also able to identify new variants of the graph-based RAG methods over specific QA and abstract QA tasks respectively, by combining existing techniques, which outperform the state-of-the-art methods. Finally, based on these findings, we offer promising research opportunities. We believe that a deeper understanding of the behavior of existing methods can provide new valuable insights for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[LaRA: Benchmarking Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Long-Context LLMs -- No Silver Bullet for LC or RAG Routing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09977v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effectively incorporating external knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for enhancing their capabilities and addressing real-world needs. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers an effective method for achieving this by retrieving the most relevant fragments into LLMs. However, the advancements in context window size for LLMs offer an alternative approach, raising the question of whether RAG remains necessary for effectively handling external knowledge. Several existing studies provide inconclusive comparisons between RAG and long-context (LC) LLMs, largely due to limitations in the benchmark designs. In this paper, we present LaRA, a novel benchmark specifically designed to rigorously compare RAG and LC LLMs. LaRA encompasses 2326 test cases across four practical QA task categories and three types of naturally occurring long texts. Through systematic evaluation of seven open-source and four proprietary LLMs, we find that the optimal choice between RAG and LC depends on a complex interplay of factors, including the model's parameter size, long-text capabilities, context length, task type, and the characteristics of the retrieved chunks. Our findings provide actionable guidelines for practitioners to effectively leverage both RAG and LC approaches in developing and deploying LLM applications.

| **[RAGEval: Scenario Specific RAG Evaluation Dataset Generation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01262v5)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful approach that enables large language models (LLMs) to incorporate external knowledge. However, evaluating the effectiveness of RAG systems in specialized scenarios remains challenging due to the high costs of data construction and the lack of suitable evaluation metrics. This paper introduces RAGEval, a framework designed to assess RAG systems across diverse scenarios by generating high-quality documents, questions, answers, and references through a schema-based pipeline. With a focus on factual accuracy, we propose three novel metrics: Completeness, Hallucination, and Irrelevance to evaluate LLM generated responses rigorously. Experimental results show that RAGEval outperforms zero-shot and one-shot methods in terms of clarity, safety, conformity, and richness of generated samples. Furthermore, the use of LLMs for scoring the proposed metrics demonstrates a high level of consistency with human evaluations. RAGEval establishes a new paradigm for evaluating RAG systems in real-world applications. The code and dataset are released at https://github.com/OpenBMB/RAGEval.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/OpenBMB/RAGEval</p></details> |
| **[Retrieval-Augmented Perception: High-Resolution Image Perception Meets Visual RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01222v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-resolution (HR) image perception remains a key challenge in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To overcome the limitations of existing methods, this paper shifts away from prior dedicated heuristic approaches and revisits the most fundamental idea to HR perception by enhancing the long-context capability of MLLMs, driven by recent advances in long-context techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for general LLMs. Towards this end, this paper presents the first study exploring the use of RAG to address HR perception challenges. Specifically, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Perception (RAP), a training-free framework that retrieves and fuses relevant image crops while preserving spatial context using the proposed Spatial-Awareness Layout. To accommodate different tasks, the proposed Retrieved-Exploration Search (RE-Search) dynamically selects the optimal number of crops based on model confidence and retrieval scores. Experimental results on HR benchmarks demonstrate the significant effectiveness of RAP, with LLaVA-v1.5-13B achieving a 43% improvement on $V^*$ Bench and 19% on HR-Bench.</p></details> |  |
