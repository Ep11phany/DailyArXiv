| **[A Survey of Self-Evolving Agents: On Path to Artificial Super Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21046v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities but remain fundamentally static, unable to adapt their internal parameters to novel tasks, evolving knowledge domains, or dynamic interaction contexts. As LLMs are increasingly deployed in open-ended, interactive environments, this static nature has become a critical bottleneck, necessitating agents that can adaptively reason, act, and evolve in real time. This paradigm shift -- from scaling static models to developing self-evolving agents -- has sparked growing interest in architectures and methods enabling continual learning and adaptation from data, interactions, and experiences. This survey provides the first systematic and comprehensive review of self-evolving agents, organized around three foundational dimensions -- what to evolve, when to evolve, and how to evolve. We examine evolutionary mechanisms across agent components (e.g., models, memory, tools, architecture), categorize adaptation methods by stages (e.g., intra-test-time, inter-test-time), and analyze the algorithmic and architectural designs that guide evolutionary adaptation (e.g., scalar rewards, textual feedback, single-agent and multi-agent systems). Additionally, we analyze evaluation metrics and benchmarks tailored for self-evolving agents, highlight applications in domains such as coding, education, and healthcare, and identify critical challenges and research directions in safety, scalability, and co-evolutionary dynamics. By providing a structured framework for understanding and designing self-evolving agents, this survey establishes a roadmap for advancing adaptive agentic systems in both research and real-world deployments, ultimately shedding lights to pave the way for the realization of Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI), where agents evolve autonomously, performing at or beyond human-level intelligence across a wide array of tasks.</p></details> | 51 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Enhancing LLM Reasoning with Iterative DPO: A Comprehensive Empirical Investigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12854v3)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in post-training methodologies for large language models (LLMs) have highlighted reinforcement learning (RL) as a critical component for enhancing reasoning. However, the substantial computational costs associated with RL-based approaches have led to growing interest in alternative paradigms, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of DPO in facilitating self-improvement for LLMs through iterative preference-based learning. We demonstrate that a single round of DPO with coarse filtering significantly enhances mathematical reasoning performance, particularly for strong base model. Furthermore, we design an iterative enhancement framework for both the generator and the reward model (RM), enabling their mutual improvement through online interaction across multiple rounds of DPO. Finally, with simple verifiable rewards, our model DPO-VP achieves RL-level performance with significantly lower computational overhead. These findings highlight DPO as a scalable and cost-effective alternative to RL, offering a practical solution for enhancing LLM reasoning in resource-constrained situations.</p></details> | 23pages |

While recent studies have exposed such failures, existing evaluations remain fragmented and lack a principled testbed. In this paper, we present MIRAGE-Bench--Measuring Illusions in Risky AGEnt settings--the first unified benchmark for eliciting and evaluating hallucinations in interactive LLM-agent scenarios. We begin by introducing a three-part taxonomy to address agentic hallucinations: actions that are unfaithful to (i) task instructions, (ii) execution history, or (iii) environment observations. To analyze, we first elicit such failures by performing a systematic audit of existing agent benchmarks, then synthesize test cases using a snapshot strategy that isolates decision points in deterministic and reproducible manners. To evaluate hallucination behaviors, we adopt a fine-grained-level LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm with tailored risk-aware prompts, enabling scalable, high-fidelity assessment of agent actions without enumerating full action spaces. MIRAGE-Bench provides actionable insights on failure modes of LLM agents and lays the groundwork for principled progress in mitigating hallucinations in interactive environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data: https://github.com/sunblaze-ucb/mirage-bench.git</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating the Promise and Pitfalls of LLMs in Hiring Decisions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02087v2)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of large language models (LLMs) in hiring promises to streamline candidate screening, but it also raises serious concerns regarding accuracy and algorithmic bias where sufficient safeguards are not in place. In this work, we benchmark several state-of-the-art foundational LLMs - including models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and Deepseek, and compare them with our proprietary domain-specific hiring model (Match Score) for job candidate matching. We evaluate each model's predictive accuracy (ROC AUC, Precision-Recall AUC, F1-score) and fairness (impact ratio of cut-off analysis across declared gender, race, and intersectional subgroups). Our experiments on a dataset of roughly 10,000 real-world recent candidate-job pairs show that Match Score outperforms the general-purpose LLMs on accuracy (ROC AUC 0.85 vs 0.77) and achieves significantly more equitable outcomes across demographic groups. Notably, Match Score attains a minimum race-wise impact ratio of 0.957 (near-parity), versus 0.809 or lower for the best LLMs, (0.906 vs 0.773 for the intersectionals, respectively). We discuss why pretraining biases may cause LLMs with insufficient safeguards to propagate societal biases in hiring scenarios, whereas a bespoke supervised model can more effectively mitigate these biases. Our findings highlight the importance of domain-specific modeling and bias auditing when deploying AI in high-stakes domains such as hiring, and caution against relying on off-the-shelf LLMs for such tasks without extensive fairness safeguards. Furthermore, we show with empirical evidence that there shouldn't be a dichotomy between choosing accuracy and fairness in hiring: a well-designed algorithm can achieve both accuracy in hiring and fairness in outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables.

| **[User-Centered Design with AI in the Loop: A Case Study of Rapid User Interface Prototyping with "Vibe Coding"](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21012v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a case study of using generative user interfaces, or ``vibe coding,'' a method leveraging large language models (LLMs) for generating code via natural language prompts, to support rapid prototyping in user-centered design (UCD). Extending traditional UCD practices, we propose an AI-in-the-loop ideate-prototyping process. We share insights from an empirical experience integrating this process to develop an interactive data analytics interface for highway traffic engineers to effectively retrieve and analyze historical traffic data. With generative UIs, the team was able to elicit rich user feedback and test multiple alternative design ideas from user evaluation interviews and real-time collaborative sessions with domain experts. We discuss the advantages and pitfalls of vibe coding for bridging the gaps between design expertise and domain-specific expertise.</p></details> |  |
| **[Memorization in Fine-Tuned Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21009v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the mechanisms and factors influencing memorization in fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), with a focus on the medical domain due to its privacy-sensitive nature. We examine how different aspects of the fine-tuning process affect a model's propensity to memorize training data, using the PHEE dataset of pharmacovigilance events. Our research employs two main approaches: a membership inference attack to detect memorized data, and a generation task with prompted prefixes to assess verbatim reproduction. We analyze the impact of adapting different weight matrices in the transformer architecture, the relationship between perplexity and memorization, and the effect of increasing the rank in low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning. Key findings include: (1) Value and Output matrices contribute more significantly to memorization compared to Query and Key matrices; (2) Lower perplexity in the fine-tuned model correlates with increased memorization; (3) Higher LoRA ranks lead to increased memorization, but with diminishing returns at higher ranks. These results provide insights into the trade-offs between model performance and privacy risks in fine-tuned LLMs. Our findings have implications for developing more effective and responsible strategies for adapting large language models while managing data privacy concerns.</p></details> |  |
| **[VArsity: Can Large Language Models Keep Power Engineering Students in Phase?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20995v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper provides an educational case study regarding our experience in deploying ChatGPT Large Language Models (LLMs) in the Spring 2025 and Fall 2023 offerings of ECE 4320: Power System Analysis and Control at Georgia Tech. As part of course assessments, students were tasked with identifying, explaining, and correcting errors in the ChatGPT outputs corresponding to power factor correction problems. While most students successfully identified the errors in the outputs from the GPT-4 version of ChatGPT used in Fall 2023, students found the errors from the ChatGPT o1 version much more difficult to identify in Spring 2025. As shown in this case study, the role of LLMs in pedagogy, assessment, and learning in power engineering classrooms is an important topic deserving further investigation.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Security Tensors as a Cross-Modal Bridge: Extending Text-Aligned Safety to Vision in LVLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20994v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large visual-language models (LVLMs) integrate aligned large language models (LLMs) with visual modules to process multimodal inputs. However, the safety mechanisms developed for text-based LLMs do not naturally extend to visual modalities, leaving LVLMs vulnerable to harmful image inputs. To address this cross-modal safety gap, we introduce security tensors - trainable input vectors applied during inference through either the textual or visual modality. These tensors transfer textual safety alignment to visual processing without modifying the model's parameters. They are optimized using a curated dataset containing (i) malicious image-text pairs requiring rejection, (ii) contrastive benign pairs with text structurally similar to malicious queries, with the purpose of being contrastive examples to guide visual reliance, and (iii) general benign samples preserving model functionality. Experimental results demonstrate that both textual and visual security tensors significantly enhance LVLMs' ability to reject diverse harmful visual inputs while maintaining near-identical performance on benign tasks. Further internal analysis towards hidden-layer representations reveals that security tensors successfully activate the language module's textual "safety layers" in visual inputs, thereby effectively extending text-based safety to the visual modality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codes...</summary><p>Codes and data are available at https://github.com/listen0425/Security-Tensors</p></details> |
| **[Scaling Physical Reasoning with the PHYSICS Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00022v3)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress on advanced reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding competitions. Meanwhile, physics, despite being both reasoning-intensive and essential to real-world understanding, received limited academic and industrial attention. This paper introduces PHYSICS, a dataset containing 16,568 high-quality physics problems spanning subjects and difficulty levels, to facilitate this issue. Specifically, PHYSICS is curated with exercises from over 100 textbooks through a carefully designed pipeline for quality control. It covers five major physics domains: Mechanics, Electromagnetism, Thermodynamics, Optics, and Modern Physics. It also spans a wide range of difficulty levels, from high school to graduate-level physics courses. To utilize the data for improving and evaluating the model's physical reasoning capabilities, we split the dataset into training and test sets, and provide reasoning paths generated by powerful reasoning models for the training data to facilitate model training. In addition, for the evaluation part, we find that existing evaluation frameworks exhibit biases in aspects such as units, simplification, and precision in physics domain. To balance efficiency and accuracy, we introduce a Rule+Model evaluation framework tailored to physics problems. Our evaluations on current state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary models highlight the limitations of current models in handling physics-related tasks. We hope that our dataset and evaluation methodology will jointly advance the development of LLMs in the field of physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work on physical datasets</p></details> |
| **[SmallThinker: A Family of Efficient Large Language Models Natively Trained for Local Deployment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20984v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While frontier large language models (LLMs) continue to push capability boundaries, their deployment remains confined to GPU-powered cloud infrastructure. We challenge this paradigm with SmallThinker, a family of LLMs natively designed - not adapted - for the unique constraints of local devices: weak computational power, limited memory, and slow storage. Unlike traditional approaches that mainly compress existing models built for clouds, we architect SmallThinker from the ground up to thrive within these limitations. Our innovation lies in a deployment-aware architecture that transforms constraints into design principles. First, We introduce a two-level sparse structure combining fine-grained Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with sparse feed-forward networks, drastically reducing computational demands without sacrificing model capacity. Second, to conquer the I/O bottleneck of slow storage, we design a pre-attention router that enables our co-designed inference engine to prefetch expert parameters from storage while computing attention, effectively hiding storage latency that would otherwise cripple on-device inference. Third, for memory efficiency, we utilize NoPE-RoPE hybrid sparse attention mechanism to slash KV cache requirements. We release SmallThinker-4B-A0.6B and SmallThinker-21B-A3B, which achieve state-of-the-art performance scores and even outperform larger LLMs. Remarkably, our co-designed system mostly eliminates the need for expensive GPU hardware: with Q4_0 quantization, both models exceed 20 tokens/s on ordinary consumer CPUs, while consuming only 1GB and 8GB of memory respectively. SmallThinker is publicly available at hf.co/PowerInfer/SmallThinker-4BA0.6B-Instruct and hf.co/PowerInfer/SmallThinker-21BA3B-Instruct.</p></details> |  |
| **[Repairing vulnerabilities without invisible hands. A differentiated replication study on LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20977v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Automated Vulnerability Repair (AVR) is a fast-growing branch of program repair. Recent studies show that large language models (LLMs) outperform traditional techniques, extending their success beyond code generation and fault detection. Hypothesis: These gains may be driven by hidden factors -- "invisible hands" such as training-data leakage or perfect fault localization -- that let an LLM reproduce human-authored fixes for the same code. Objective: We replicate prior AVR studies under controlled conditions by deliberately adding errors to the reported vulnerability location in the prompt. If LLMs merely regurgitate memorized fixes, both small and large localization errors should yield the same number of correct patches, because any offset should divert the model from the original fix. Method: Our pipeline repairs vulnerabilities from the Vul4J and VJTrans benchmarks after shifting the fault location by n lines from the ground truth. A first LLM generates a patch, a second LLM reviews it, and we validate the result with regression and proof-of-vulnerability tests. Finally, we manually audit a sample of patches and estimate the error rate with the Agresti-Coull-Wilson method.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Deep Learning for Geometry Problem Solving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11936v4)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geometry problem solving is a key area of mathematical reasoning, which is widely involved in many important fields such as education, mathematical ability assessment of artificial intelligence, and multimodal ability assessment. In recent years, the rapid development of deep learning technology, especially the rise of multimodal large language models, has triggered a widespread research boom. This paper provides a survey of the applications of deep learning in geometry problem solving, including (i) a comprehensive summary of the relevant tasks in geometry problem solving; (ii) a thorough review of related deep learning methods; (iii) a detailed analysis of evaluation metrics and methods; and (iv) a critical discussion of the current challenges and future directions that can be explored. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive and practical reference of deep learning for geometry problem solving to promote further developments in this field. We create a continuously updated list of papers on GitHub: https://github.com/majianz/dl4gps.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[PROVCREATOR: Synthesizing Complex Heterogenous Graphs with Node and Edge Attributes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20967v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of graph-structured data has driven interest in graph learning and synthetic data generation. While successful in text and image domains, synthetic graph generation remains challenging -- especially for real-world graphs with complex, heterogeneous schemas. Existing research has focused mostly on homogeneous structures with simple attributes, limiting their usefulness and relevance for application domains requiring semantic fidelity. In this research, we introduce ProvCreator, a synthetic graph framework designed for complex heterogeneous graphs with high-dimensional node and edge attributes. ProvCreator formulates graph synthesis as a sequence generation task, enabling the use of transformer-based large language models. It features a versatile graph-to-sequence encoder-decoder that 1. losslessly encodes graph structure and attributes, 2. efficiently compresses large graphs for contextual modeling, and 3. supports end-to-end, learnable graph generation. To validate our research, we evaluate ProvCreator on two challenging domains: system provenance graphs in cybersecurity and knowledge graphs from IntelliGraph Benchmark Dataset. In both cases, ProvCreator captures intricate dependencies between structure and semantics, enabling the generation of realistic and privacy-aware synthetic datasets.</p></details> |  |

These conflicts become particularly problematic when LLMs are deployed in real-world investment services, where misalignment between a model's embedded preferences and those of the financial institution can lead to unreliable recommendations. Yet little research has examined what investment views LLMs actually hold. We propose an experimental framework to investigate such conflicts, offering the first quantitative analysis of confirmation bias in LLM-based investment analysis. Using hypothetical scenarios with balanced and imbalanced arguments, we extract models' latent preferences and measure their persistence. Focusing on sector, size, and momentum, our analysis reveals distinct, model-specific tendencies. In particular, we observe a consistent preference for large-cap stocks and contrarian strategies across most models. These preferences often harden into confirmation bias, with models clinging to initial judgments despite counter-evidence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adopting Large Language Models to Automated System Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08490v2)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern enterprise computing systems integrate numerous subsystems to resolve a common task by yielding emergent behavior. A widespread approach is using services implemented with Web technologies like REST or OpenAPI, which offer an interaction mechanism and service documentation standard, respectively. Each service represents a specific business functionality, allowing encapsulation and easier maintenance. Despite the reduced maintenance costs on an individual service level, increased integration complexity arises. Consequently, automated service composition approaches have arisen to mitigate this issue. Nevertheless, these approaches have not achieved high acceptance in practice due to their reliance on complex formal modeling. Within this Ph.D. thesis, we analyze the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically integrate the services based on a natural language input. The result is a reusable service composition, e.g., as program code. While not always generating entirely correct results, the result can still be helpful by providing integration engineers with a close approximation of a suitable solution, which requires little effort to become operational. Our research involves (i) introducing a software architecture for automated service composition using LLMs, (ii) analyzing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for service discovery, (iii) proposing a novel natural language query-based benchmark for service discovery, and (iv) extending the benchmark to complete service composition scenarios. We have presented our software architecture as Compositio Prompto, the analysis of RAG for service discovery, and submitted a proposal for the service discovery benchmark. Open topics are primarily the extension of the service discovery benchmark to service composition scenarios and the improvements of the service composition generation, e.g., using fine-tuning or LLM agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint has not undergone peer review (when applicable) or any post-submission improvements or corrections.

| **[Mind the Gap: Conformative Decoding to Improve Output Diversity of Instruction-Tuned Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20956v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction-tuning large language models (LLMs) reduces the diversity of their outputs, which has implications for many tasks, particularly for creative tasks. This paper investigates the ``diversity gap'' for a writing prompt narrative generation task. This gap emerges as measured by current diversity metrics for various open-weight and open-source LLMs. The results show significant decreases in diversity due to instruction-tuning. We explore the diversity loss at each fine-tuning stage for the OLMo and OLMo 2 models to further understand how output diversity is affected. The results indicate that DPO has the most substantial impact on diversity. Motivated by these findings, we present a new decoding strategy, conformative decoding, which guides an instruct model using its more diverse base model to reintroduce output diversity. We show that conformative decoding typically increases diversity and even maintains or improves quality.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Advanced System Integration: Analyzing OpenAPI Chunking for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19804v2)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating multiple (sub-)systems is essential to create advanced Information Systems (ISs). Difficulties mainly arise when integrating dynamic environments across the IS lifecycle. A traditional approach is a registry that provides the API documentation of the systems' endpoints. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown to be capable of automatically creating system integrations (e.g., as service composition) based on this documentation but require concise input due to input token limitations, especially regarding comprehensive API descriptions. Currently, it is unknown how best to preprocess these API descriptions. Within this work, we (i) analyze the usage of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for endpoint discovery and the chunking, i.e., preprocessing, of OpenAPIs to reduce the input token length while preserving the most relevant information. To further reduce the input token length for the composition prompt and improve endpoint retrieval, we propose (ii) a Discovery Agent that only receives a summary of the most relevant endpoints and retrieves details on demand. We evaluate RAG for endpoint discovery using the RestBench benchmark, first, for the different chunking possibilities and parameters measuring the endpoint retrieval recall, precision, and F1 score. Then, we assess the Discovery Agent using the same test set. With our prototype, we demonstrate how to successfully employ RAG for endpoint discovery to reduce the token count. While revealing high values for recall, precision, and F1, further research is necessary to retrieve all requisite endpoints. Our experiments show that for preprocessing, LLM-based and format-specific approaches outperform na\"ive chunking methods. Relying on an agent further enhances these results as the agent splits the tasks into multiple fine granular subtasks, improving the overall RAG performance in the token count, precision, and F1 score.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint has not undergone peer review (when applicable) or any post-submission improvements or corrections.

| **[Dissecting Persona-Driven Reasoning in Language Models via Activation Patching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20936v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable versatility in adopting diverse personas. In this study, we examine how assigning a persona influences a model's reasoning on an objective task. Using activation patching, we take a first step toward understanding how key components of the model encode persona-specific information. Our findings reveal that the early Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layers attend not only to the syntactic structure of the input but also process its semantic content. These layers transform persona tokens into richer representations, which are then used by the middle Multi-Head Attention (MHA) layers to shape the model's output. Additionally, we identify specific attention heads that disproportionately attend to racial and color-based identities.</p></details> | 11 pages |

This work presents an effective approach for detecting and editing factually incorrect content in model-generated responses based on the provided context. Given a user-defined domain-specific error taxonomy, we construct a synthetic dataset by inserting tagged errors into financial question-answering corpora and then fine-tune four language models, Phi-4, Phi-4-mini, Qwen3-4B, and Qwen3-14B, to detect and edit these factual inaccuracies. Our best-performing model, fine-tuned Phi-4, achieves an 8% improvement in binary F1 score and a 30% gain in overall detection performance compared to OpenAI-o3. Notably, our fine-tuned Phi-4-mini model, despite having only 4 billion parameters, maintains competitive performance with just a 2% drop in binary detection and a 0.1% decline in overall detection compared to OpenAI-o3. Our work provides a practical solution for detecting and editing factual inconsistencies in financial text generation while introducing a generalizable framework that can enhance the trustworthiness and alignment of large language models across diverse applications beyond finance.

| **[LLM2TEA: An Agentic AI Designer for Discovery with Generative Evolutionary Multitasking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14917v3)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents LLM2TEA, a Large Language Model (LLM) driven MultiTask Evolutionary Algorithm, representing the first agentic AI designer of its kind operating with generative evolutionary multitasking (GEM). LLM2TEA enables the crossbreeding of solutions from multiple domains, fostering novel solutions that transcend disciplinary boundaries. Of particular interest is the ability to discover designs that are both novel and conforming to real-world physical specifications. LLM2TEA comprises an LLM to generate genotype samples from text prompts describing target objects, a text-to-3D generative model to produce corresponding phenotypes, a classifier to interpret its semantic representations, and a computational simulator to assess its physical properties. Novel LLM-based multitask evolutionary operators are introduced to guide the search towards high-performing, practically viable designs. Experimental results in conceptual design optimization validate the effectiveness of LLM2TEA, showing 97% to 174% improvements in the diversity of novel designs over the current text-to-3D baseline. Moreover, over 73% of the generated designs outperform the top 1% of designs produced by the text-to-3D baseline in terms of physical performance. The designs produced by LLM2TEA are not only aesthetically creative but also functional in real-world contexts. Several of these designs have been successfully 3D printed, demonstrating the ability of our approach to transform AI-generated outputs into tangible, physical designs. These designs underscore the potential of LLM2TEA as a powerful tool for complex design optimization and discovery, capable of producing novel and physically viable designs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is accepted by IEEE CIM.

| **[FHSTP@EXIST 2025 Benchmark: Sexism Detection with Transparent Speech Concept Bottleneck Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20924v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sexism has become widespread on social media and in online conversation. To help address this issue, the fifth Sexism Identification in Social Networks (EXIST) challenge is initiated at CLEF 2025. Among this year's international benchmarks, we concentrate on solving the first task aiming to identify and classify sexism in social media textual posts. In this paper, we describe our solutions and report results for three subtasks: Subtask 1.1 - Sexism Identification in Tweets, Subtask 1.2 - Source Intention in Tweets, and Subtask 1.3 - Sexism Categorization in Tweets. We implement three models to address each subtask which constitute three individual runs: Speech Concept Bottleneck Model (SCBM), Speech Concept Bottleneck Model with Transformer (SCBMT), and a fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa transformer model. SCBM uses descriptive adjectives as human-interpretable bottleneck concepts. SCBM leverages large language models (LLMs) to encode input texts into a human-interpretable representation of adjectives, then used to train a lightweight classifier for downstream tasks. SCBMT extends SCBM by fusing adjective-based representation with contextual embeddings from transformers to balance interpretability and classification performance. Beyond competitive results, these two models offer fine-grained explanations at both instance (local) and class (global) levels. We also investigate how additional metadata, e.g., annotators' demographic profiles, can be leveraged. For Subtask 1.1, XLM-RoBERTa, fine-tuned on provided data augmented with prior datasets, ranks 6th for English and Spanish and 4th for English in the Soft-Soft evaluation. Our SCBMT achieves 7th for English and Spanish and 6th for Spanish.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[Pareto-Grid-Guided Large Language Models for Fast and High-Quality Heuristics Design in Multi-Objective Combinatorial Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20923v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOP) frequently arise in practical applications that require the simultaneous optimization of conflicting objectives. Although traditional evolutionary algorithms can be effective, they typically depend on domain knowledge and repeated parameter tuning, limiting flexibility when applied to unseen MOCOP instances. Recently, integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into evolutionary computation has opened new avenues for automatic heuristic generation, using their advanced language understanding and code synthesis capabilities. Nevertheless, most existing approaches predominantly focus on single-objective tasks, often neglecting key considerations such as runtime efficiency and heuristic diversity in multi-objective settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce Multi-heuristics for MOCOP via Pareto-Grid-guided Evolution of LLMs (MPaGE), a novel enhancement of the Simple Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization (SEMO) framework that leverages LLMs and Pareto Front Grid (PFG) technique. By partitioning the objective space into grids and retaining top-performing candidates to guide heuristic generation, MPaGE utilizes LLMs to prioritize heuristics with semantically distinct logical structures during variation, thus promoting diversity and mitigating redundancy within the population.

MediQAl contains 32,603 questions sourced from French medical examinations across 41 medical subjects. The dataset includes three tasks: (i) Multiple-Choice Question with Unique answer, (ii) Multiple-Choice Question with Multiple answer, and (iii) Open-Ended Question with Short-Answer. Each question is labeled as Understanding or Reasoning, enabling a detailed analysis of models' cognitive capabilities. We validate the MediQAl dataset through extensive evaluation with 14 large language models, including recent reasoning-augmented models, and observe a significant performance gap between factual recall and reasoning tasks. Our evaluation provides a comprehensive benchmark for assessing language models' performance on French medical question answering, addressing a crucial gap in multilingual resources for the medical domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[Soft Injection of Task Embeddings Outperforms Prompt-Based In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20906v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-Context Learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform tasks by conditioning on input-output examples in the prompt, without requiring any update in model parameters. While widely adopted, it remains unclear whether prompting with multiple examples is the most effective and efficient way to convey task information. In this work, we propose Soft Injection of task embeddings. The task embeddings are constructed only once using few-shot ICL prompts and repeatedly used during inference. Soft injection is performed by softly mixing task embeddings with attention head activations using pre-optimized mixing parameters, referred to as soft head-selection parameters. This method not only allows a desired task to be performed without in-prompt demonstrations but also significantly outperforms existing ICL approaches while reducing memory usage and compute cost at inference time. An extensive evaluation is performed across 57 tasks and 12 LLMs, spanning four model families of sizes from 4B to 70B. Averaged across 57 tasks, our method outperforms 10-shot ICL by 10.1%-13.9% across 12 LLMs. Additional analyses show that our method also serves as an insightful tool for analyzing task-relevant roles of attention heads, revealing that task-relevant head positions selected by our method transfer across similar tasks but not across dissimilar ones -- underscoring the task-specific nature of head functionality. Our soft injection method opens a new paradigm for reducing prompt length and improving task performance by shifting task conditioning from the prompt space to the activation space.</p></details> | Preprint |

Traditional regex and entropy-based tools often generate high false positives due to limited contextual understanding. Aims: This work aims to enhance secret detection in source code using large language models (LLMs), reducing false positives while maintaining high recall. We also evaluate the feasibility of using fine-tuned, smaller models for local deployment. Method: We propose a hybrid approach combining regex-based candidate extraction with LLM-based classification. We evaluate pre-trained and fine-tuned variants of various Large Language Models on a benchmark dataset from 818 GitHub repositories. Various prompting strategies and efficient fine-tuning methods are employed for both binary and multiclass classification. Results: The fine-tuned LLaMA-3.1 8B model achieved an F1-score of 0.9852 in binary classification, outperforming regex-only baselines. For multiclass classification, Mistral-7B reached 0.982 accuracy. Fine-tuning significantly improved performance across all models. Conclusions: Fine-tuned LLMs offer an effective and scalable solution for secret detection, greatly reducing false positives. Open-source models provide a practical alternative to commercial APIs, enabling secure and cost-efficient deployment in development workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>19th ...</summary><p>19th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM 2025) cameraready</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Project-Specific Code Completion by Inferring Internal API Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20888v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Project-specific code completion is a critical task that leverages context from a project to generate accurate code. State-of-the-art methods use retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) and project information for code completion. However, they often struggle to incorporate internal API information, which is crucial for accuracy, especially when APIs are not explicitly imported in the file. To address this, we propose a method to infer internal API information without relying on imports. Our method extends the representation of APIs by constructing usage examples and semantic descriptions, building a knowledge base for LLMs to generate relevant completions. We also introduce ProjBench, a benchmark that avoids leaked imports and consists of large-scale real-world projects. Experiments on ProjBench and CrossCodeEval show that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, improving code exact match by 22.72% and identifier exact match by 18.31%. Additionally, integrating our method with existing baselines boosts code match by 47.80% and identifier match by 35.55%.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Human-in-the-loop Approach to Robot Action Replanning through LLM Common-Sense Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20870v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To facilitate the wider adoption of robotics, accessible programming tools are required for non-experts. Observational learning enables intuitive human skills transfer through hands-on demonstrations, but relying solely on visual input can be inefficient in terms of scalability and failure mitigation, especially when based on a single demonstration. This paper presents a human-in-the-loop method for enhancing the robot execution plan, automatically generated based on a single RGB video, with natural language input to a Large Language Model (LLM). By including user-specified goals or critical task aspects and exploiting the LLM common-sense reasoning, the system adjusts the vision-based plan to prevent potential failures and adapts it based on the received instructions. Experiments demonstrated the framework intuitiveness and effectiveness in correcting vision-derived errors and adapting plans without requiring additional demonstrations. Moreover, interactive plan refinement and hallucination corrections promoted system robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Large Language Model-Supported Threat Modeling Framework for Transportation Cyber-Physical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00831v2)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing threat modeling frameworks related to transportation cyber-physical systems (CPS) are often narrow in scope, labor-intensive, and require substantial cybersecurity expertise. To this end, we introduce the Transportation Cybersecurity and Resiliency Threat Modeling Framework (TraCR-TMF), a large language model (LLM)-based threat modeling framework for transportation CPS that requires limited cybersecurity expert intervention. TraCR-TMF identifies threats, potential attack techniques, and relevant countermeasures for transportation CPS. Three LLM-based approaches support these identifications: (i) a retrieval-augmented generation approach requiring no cybersecurity expert intervention, (ii) an in-context learning approach with low expert intervention, and (iii) a supervised fine-tuning approach with moderate expert intervention. TraCR-TMF offers LLM-based attack path identification for critical assets based on vulnerabilities across transportation CPS entities. Additionally, it incorporates the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) scores of known exploited vulnerabilities to prioritize threat mitigations. The framework was evaluated through two cases. First, the framework identified relevant attack techniques for various transportation CPS applications, 73% of which were validated by cybersecurity experts as correct. Second, the framework was used to identify attack paths for a target asset in a real-world cyberattack incident. TraCR-TMF successfully predicted exploitations, like lateral movement of adversaries, data exfiltration, and data encryption for ransomware, as reported in the incident. These findings show the efficacy of TraCR-TMF in transportation CPS threat modeling, while reducing the need for extensive involvement of cybersecurity experts. To facilitate real-world adoptions, all our codes are shared via an open-source repository.</p></details> |  |

While proprietary large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in clinical natural language processing, their lack of transparency and data privacy concerns limit their utility in healthcare. This study therefore evaluates nine open-source generative LLMs on the DRAGON benchmark, which includes 28 clinical information extraction tasks in Dutch. We developed \texttt{llm\_extractinator}, a publicly available framework for information extraction using open-source generative LLMs, and used it to assess model performance in a zero-shot setting. Several 14 billion parameter models, Phi-4-14B, Qwen-2.5-14B, and DeepSeek-R1-14B, achieved competitive results, while the bigger Llama-3.3-70B model achieved slightly higher performance at greater computational cost. Translation to English prior to inference consistently degraded performance, highlighting the need of native-language processing. These findings demonstrate that open-source LLMs, when used with our framework, offer effective, scalable, and privacy-conscious solutions for clinical information extraction in low-resource settings.</p></details> | 34 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Latent Inter-User Difference Modeling for LLM Personalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20849v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into users' daily lives, leading to a growing demand for personalized outputs. Previous work focuses on leveraging a user's own history, overlooking inter-user differences that are crucial for effective personalization. While recent work has attempted to model such differences, the reliance on language-based prompts often hampers the effective extraction of meaningful distinctions. To address these issues, we propose Difference-aware Embedding-based Personalization (DEP), a framework that models inter-user differences in the latent space instead of relying on language prompts. DEP constructs soft prompts by contrasting a user's embedding with those of peers who engaged with similar content, highlighting relative behavioral signals. A sparse autoencoder then filters and compresses both user-specific and difference-aware embeddings, preserving only task-relevant features before injecting them into a frozen LLM. Experiments on personalized review generation show that DEP consistently outperforms baseline methods across multiple metrics.

Recent work leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to tackle this task. However, their large parameter size results in high training costs and low inference efficiency. To address this, we propose PUMA: a Layer-Pruned Language Model for Efficient Unified Multimodal Retrieval with Modality-Adaptive Learning. Our approach improves UMR from both structural and learning perspectives. (1) Structurally, we propose Layer-Pruned Self-Distillation, which prunes MLLMs by keeping only shallow layers while distilling features from dropped deep layers as teacher signals. This reduces parameters and preserves representation capability. (2) On the learning side, we introduce Modality-Adaptive Contrastive Learning Loss (MAC-Loss), which separates in-batch negatives into harder intra-modality and easier inter-modality groups based on the target modality, assigning different temperature strategies to enhance learning efficiency. Experiments show our method significantly reduces resource usage while maintaining strong performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM MM 2025</p></details> |

We emphasise the importance of understanding reasoning behaviour as opposed to high-level prediction accuracies, since it is equivalent to explainable AI (XAI) in this context. In particular, achieving XAI in medical LLMs used in the clinical domain will have a significant impact across the healthcare sector. Results: Therefore, in this work, we adapt the existing concept of reasoning behaviour and articulate its interpretation within the specific context of medical LLMs. We survey and categorise current state-of-the-art approaches for modeling and evaluating reasoning reasoning in medical LLMs. Additionally, we propose theoretical frameworks which can empower medical professionals or machine learning engineers to gain insight into the low-level reasoning operations of these previously obscure models. We also outline key open challenges facing the development of Large Reasoning Models. Conclusion: The subsequent increased transparency and trust in medical machine learning models by clinicians as well as patients will accelerate the integration, application as well as further development of medical AI for the healthcare system as a whole.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables.

| **[Aligning Large Language Model Agents with Rational and Moral Preferences: A Supervised Fine-Tuning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20796v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how large language model (LLM) agents behave in strategic interactions is essential as these systems increasingly participate autonomously in economically and morally consequential decisions. We evaluate LLM preferences using canonical economic games, finding substantial deviations from human behavior. Models like GPT-4o show excessive cooperation and limited incentive sensitivity, while reasoning models, such as o3-mini, align more consistently with payoff-maximizing strategies. We propose a supervised fine-tuning pipeline that uses synthetic datasets derived from economic reasoning to align LLM agents with economic preferences, focusing on two stylized preference structures. In the first, utility depends only on individual payoffs (homo economicus), while utility also depends on a notion of Kantian universalizability in the second preference structure (homo moralis). We find that fine-tuning based on small datasets shifts LLM agent behavior toward the corresponding economic agent. We further assess the fine-tuned agents' behavior in two applications: Moral dilemmas involving autonomous vehicles and algorithmic pricing in competitive markets. These examples illustrate how different normative objectives embedded via realizations from structured preference structures can influence market and moral outcomes. This work contributes a replicable, cost-efficient, and economically grounded pipeline to align AI preferences using moral-economic principles.</p></details> |  |
| **[FocalPO: Enhancing Preference Optimizing by Focusing on Correct Preference Rankings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06645v3)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient preference optimization algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have become a popular approach in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. These algorithms implicitly treat the LLM as a reward model, and focus on training it to correct misranked preference pairs. However, recent work~\citep{chen2024preference} empirically finds that DPO training \textit{rarely improves these misranked preference pairs}, despite its gradient emphasizing on these cases. We introduce FocalPO, a DPO variant that instead \textit{down-weighs} misranked preference pairs and prioritizes enhancing the model's understanding of pairs that it can already rank correctly. Inspired by Focal Loss used in vision tasks, FocalPO achieves this by adding a modulating factor to dynamically scale DPO loss. Our experiment demonstrates that FocalPO surpasses DPO and its variants on popular benchmarks like Alpaca Eval 2.0 using Mistral-Base-7B and Llama-3-Instruct-8B, with the introduced hyperparameter fixed. Additionally, we empirically reveals how FocalPO affects training on correct and incorrect sample groups, further underscoring its effectiveness.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |
| **[Automating Thematic Review of Prevention of Future Deaths Reports: Replicating the ONS Child Suicide Study using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20786v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prevention of Future Deaths (PFD) reports, issued by coroners in England and Wales, flag systemic hazards that may lead to further loss of life. Analysis of these reports has previously been constrained by the manual effort required to identify and code relevant cases. In 2025, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) published a national thematic review of child-suicide PFD reports ($\leq$ 18 years), identifying 37 cases from January 2015 to November 2023 - a process based entirely on manual curation and coding. We evaluated whether a fully automated, open source "text-to-table" language-model pipeline (PFD Toolkit) could reproduce the ONS's identification and thematic analysis of child-suicide PFD reports, and assessed gains in efficiency and reliability. All 4,249 PFD reports published from July 2013 to November 2023 were processed via PFD Toolkit's large language model pipelines. Automated screening identified cases where the coroner attributed death to suicide in individuals aged 18 or younger, and eligible reports were coded for recipient category and 23 concern sub-themes, replicating the ONS coding frame. PFD Toolkit identified 72 child-suicide PFD reports - almost twice the ONS count. Three blinded clinicians adjudicated a stratified sample of 144 reports to validate the child-suicide screening. Against the post-consensus clinical annotations, the LLM-based workflow showed substantial to almost-perfect agreement (Cohen's $\kappa$ = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.66-0.98, raw agreement = 91%). The end-to-end script runtime was 8m 16s, transforming a process that previously took months into one that can be completed in minutes. This demonstrates that automated LLM analysis can reliably and efficiently replicate manual thematic reviews of coronial data, enabling scalable, reproducible, and timely insights for public health and safety. The PFD Toolkit is openly available for future research.</p></details> | 8 pages, 1 figure |

However, evaluating the quality of generated comments remains a challenge. Traditional metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE fail to capture domain-specific nuances, while human evaluation is costly and unscalable. In this paper, we present \texttt{evalSmarT}, a modular and extensible framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as evaluators. The system supports over 400 evaluator configurations by combining approximately 40 LLMs with 10 prompting strategies. We demonstrate its application in benchmarking comment generation tools and selecting the most informative outputs. Our results show that prompt design significantly impacts alignment with human judgment, and that LLM-based evaluation offers a scalable and semantically rich alternative to existing methods.</p></details> | 4 pages, 4 tables |
| **[Learning Only with Images: Visual Reinforcement Learning with Reasoning, Rendering, and Visual Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20766v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited impressive performance across various visual tasks. Subsequent investigations into enhancing their visual reasoning abilities have significantly expanded their performance envelope. However, a critical bottleneck in the advancement of MLLMs toward deep visual reasoning is their heavy reliance on curated image-text supervision. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel framework termed ``Reasoning-Rendering-Visual-Feedback'' (RRVF), which enables MLLMs to learn complex visual reasoning from only raw images. This framework builds on the ``Asymmetry of Verification'' principle to train MLLMs, i.e., verifying the rendered output against a source image is easier than generating it. We demonstrate that this relative ease provides an ideal reward signal for optimization via Reinforcement Learning (RL) training, reducing the reliance on the image-text supervision. Guided by the above principle, RRVF implements a closed-loop iterative process encompassing reasoning, rendering, and visual feedback components, enabling the model to perform self-correction through multi-turn interactions and tool invocation, while this pipeline can be optimized by the GRPO algorithm in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on image-to-code generation for data charts and web interfaces show that RRVF substantially outperforms existing open-source MLLMs and surpasses supervised fine-tuning baselines. Our findings demonstrate that systems driven by purely visual feedback present a viable path toward more robust and generalizable reasoning models without requiring explicit supervision. Code will be available at https://github.com/L-O-I/RRVF.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Impact of LoRA Adapters on LLMs for Clinical Text Classification Under Computational and Data Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19299v3)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP) poses significant challenges due to domain gap, limited data, and stringent hardware constraints. In this study, we evaluate four adapter techniques-Adapter, Lightweight, TinyAttention, and Gated Residual Network (GRN) - equivalent to Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), for clinical note classification under real-world, resource-constrained conditions. All experiments were conducted on a single NVIDIA Quadro P620 GPU (2 GB VRAM, 512 CUDA cores, 1.386 TFLOPS FP32), limiting batch sizes to <8 sequences and maximum sequence length to 256 tokens. Our clinical corpus comprises only 580 000 tokens, several orders of magnitude smaller than standard LLM pre-training datasets. We fine-tuned three biomedical pre-trained LLMs (CamemBERT-bio, AliBERT, DrBERT) and two lightweight Transformer models trained from scratch. Results show that 1) adapter structures provide no consistent gains when fine-tuning biomedical LLMs under these constraints, and 2) simpler Transformers, with minimal parameter counts and training times under six hours, outperform adapter-augmented LLMs, which required over 1000 GPU-hours. Among adapters, GRN achieved the best metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 = 0.88). These findings demonstrate that, in low-resource clinical settings with limited data and compute, lightweight Transformers trained from scratch offer a more practical and efficient solution than large LLMs, while GRN remains a viable adapter choice when minimal adaptation is needed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the IEEE Access</p></details> |
| **[Watermarking Large Language Model-based Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20762v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model-based Time Series Forecasting (LLMTS) has shown remarkable promise in handling complex and diverse temporal data, representing a significant step toward foundation models for time series analysis. However, this emerging paradigm introduces two critical challenges. First, the substantial commercial potential and resource-intensive development raise urgent concerns about intellectual property (IP) protection. Second, their powerful time series forecasting capabilities may be misused to produce misleading or fabricated deepfake time series data. To address these concerns, we explore watermarking the outputs of LLMTS models, that is, embedding imperceptible signals into the generated time series data that remain detectable by specialized algorithms. We propose a novel post-hoc watermarking framework, Waltz, which is broadly compatible with existing LLMTS models. Waltz is inspired by the empirical observation that time series patch embeddings are rarely aligned with a specific set of LLM tokens, which we term ``cold tokens''. Leveraging this insight, Waltz embeds watermarks by rewiring the similarity statistics between patch embeddings and cold token embeddings, and detects watermarks using similarity z-scores. To minimize potential side effects, we introduce a similarity-based embedding position identification strategy and employ projected gradient descent to constrain the watermark noise within a defined boundary. Extensive experiments using two popular LLMTS models across seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that Waltz achieves high watermark detection accuracy with minimal impact on the quality of the generated time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multilingual Self-Taught Faithfulness Evaluators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20752v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing use of large language models (LLMs) has increased the need for automatic evaluation systems, particularly to address the challenge of information hallucination. Although existing faithfulness evaluation approaches have shown promise, they are predominantly English-focused and often require expensive human-labeled training data for fine-tuning specialized models. As LLMs see increased adoption in multilingual contexts, there is a need for accurate faithfulness evaluators that can operate across languages without extensive labeled data. This paper presents Self-Taught Evaluators for Multilingual Faithfulness, a framework that learns exclusively from synthetic multilingual summarization data while leveraging cross-lingual transfer learning. Through experiments comparing language-specific and mixed-language fine-tuning approaches, we demonstrate a consistent relationship between an LLM's general language capabilities and its performance in language-specific evaluation tasks. Our framework shows improvements over existing baselines, including state-of-the-art English evaluators and machine translation-based approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating Structural Pruning and Recovery Techniques for Compressing Multimodal Large Language Models: An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20749v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities, their substantial computational and memory requirements pose significant barriers to practical deployment. Current parameter reduction techniques primarily involve training MLLMs from Small Language Models (SLMs), but these methods offer limited flexibility and remain computationally intensive. To address this gap, we propose to directly compress existing MLLMs through structural pruning combined with efficient recovery training. Specifically, we investigate two structural pruning paradigms--layerwise and widthwise pruning--applied to the language model backbone of MLLMs, alongside supervised finetuning and knowledge distillation. Additionally, we assess the feasibility of conducting recovery training with only a small fraction of the available data. Our results show that widthwise pruning generally maintains better performance in low-resource scenarios with limited computational resources or insufficient finetuning data. As for the recovery training, finetuning only the multimodal projector is sufficient at small compression levels (< 20%). Furthermore, a combination of supervised finetuning and hidden-state distillation yields optimal recovery across various pruning levels. Notably, effective recovery can be achieved with as little as 5% of the original training data, while retaining over 95% of the original performance. Through empirical study on two representative MLLMs, i.e., LLaVA-v1.5-7B and Bunny-v1.0-3B, this study offers actionable insights for practitioners aiming to compress MLLMs effectively without extensive computation resources or sufficient data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at GCPR 2025</p></details> |

However, current approaches remain limited to textual information, ignoring crucial multimodal cues such as facial expressions and tone of voice that humans naturally use to communicate. Moreover, existing SDG agents primarily focus on inferring other players' identities without modeling how others perceive themselves or fellow players. To address these limitations, we use One Night Ultimate Werewolf (ONUW) as a testbed and present MultiMind, the first framework integrating multimodal information into SDG agents. MultiMind processes facial expressions and vocal tones alongside verbal content, while employing a Theory of Mind (ToM) model to represent each player's suspicion levels toward others. By combining this ToM model with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), our agent identifies communication strategies that minimize suspicion directed at itself. Through comprehensive evaluation in both agent-versus-agent simulations and studies with human players, we demonstrate MultiMind's superior performance in gameplay. Our work presents a significant advancement toward LLM agents capable of human-like social reasoning across multimodal domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACMMM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Can Prompt Difficulty be Online Predicted for Accelerating RL Finetuning of Reasoning Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04632v3)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances have witnessed the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL) finetuning in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The optimization process often requires numerous iterations to achieve satisfactory performance, resulting in high computational costs due to the need for frequent prompt evaluations under intensive LLM interactions and repeated policy updates. Appropriate online prompt selection methods reduce iteration steps by prioritizing informative prompts during training, while the pipeline's reliance on exhaustive prompt evaluation and subset selection for optimization still incurs substantial computational overhead due to frequent LLM inference calls. Distinguished from these direct evaluate-then-select schemes, this work investigates iterative approximate evaluation for arbitrary prompts and introduces Model Predictive Prompt Selection (MoPPS), a Bayesian risk-predictive framework that online estimates prompt difficulty without requiring costly LLM interactions. Technically, MoPPS models each prompt's success rate as a latent variable, performs streaming Bayesian inference, and employs posterior sampling in a constructed multi-armed bandit machine, enabling sample efficient and adaptive prompt selection. Extensive experiments across mathematics, planning, and vision-based geometry tasks show that MoPPS reliably predicts prompt difficulty and accelerates training with significantly reduced LLM rollouts.</p></details> |  |

These capabilities have the potential to enrich learning by enabling users to capture and interact with information using a variety of modalities, but little is known about how educators envision how MLLMs might shape the future of learning experiences, what challenges diverse teachers encounter when interpreting how these models work, and what practical needs should be considered for successful implementation in educational contexts. We investigated educator perspectives through formative workshops with 12 K-12 educators, where participants brainstormed learning opportunities, discussed practical concerns for effective use, and prototyped their own MLLM-powered learning applications using Claude 3.5 and its Artifacts feature for previewing code-based output. We use case studies to illustrate two contrasting end-user approaches (teacher-and student-driven), and share insights about opportunities and concerns expressed by our participants, ending with implications for leveraging MLLMs for future learning experiences.</p></details> |  |

We demonstrate that GSPO achieves superior training efficiency and performance compared to the GRPO algorithm, notably stabilizes Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) RL training, and has the potential for simplifying the design of RL infrastructure. These merits of GSPO have contributed to the remarkable improvements in the latest Qwen3 models.</p></details> |  |

While large language models have shown remarkable capabilities across many NLP tasks, their effectiveness for multilingual claim verification with nuanced classification schemes remains understudied. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of five state-of-the-art language models on the X-Fact dataset, which spans 25 languages with seven distinct veracity categories. Our experiments compare small language models (encoder-based XLM-R and mT5) with recent decoder-only LLMs (Llama 3.1, Qwen 2.5, Mistral Nemo) using both prompting and fine-tuning approaches. Surprisingly, we find that XLM-R (270M parameters) substantially outperforms all tested LLMs (7-12B parameters), achieving 57.7% macro-F1 compared to the best LLM performance of 16.9%. This represents a 15.8% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art (41.9%), establishing new performance benchmarks for multilingual fact verification. Our analysis reveals problematic patterns in LLM behavior, including systematic difficulties in leveraging evidence and pronounced biases toward frequent categories in imbalanced data settings. These findings suggest that for fine-grained multilingual fact verification, smaller specialized models may be more effective than general-purpose large models, with important implications for practical deployment of fact-checking systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the FEVER Workshop, ACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[LUT Tensor Core: A Software-Hardware Co-Design for LUT-Based Low-Bit LLM Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06003v3)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) inference becomes resource-intensive, prompting a shift toward low-bit model weights to reduce the memory footprint and improve efficiency. Such low-bit LLMs necessitate the mixed-precision matrix multiplication (mpGEMM), an important yet underexplored operation involving the multiplication of lower-precision weights with higher-precision activations. Off-the-shelf hardware does not support this operation natively, leading to indirect, thus inefficient, dequantization-based implementations. In this paper, we study the lookup table (LUT)-based approach for mpGEMM and find that a conventional LUT implementation fails to achieve the promised gains. To unlock the full potential of LUT-based mpGEMM, we propose LUT Tensor Core, a software-hardware co-design for low-bit LLM inference. LUT Tensor Core differentiates itself from conventional LUT designs through: 1) software-based optimizations to minimize table precompute overhead and weight reinterpretation to reduce table storage; 2) a LUT-based Tensor Core hardware design with an elongated tiling shape to maximize table reuse and a bit-serial design to support diverse precision combinations in mpGEMM; 3) a new instruction set and compilation optimizations for LUT-based mpGEMM. LUT Tensor Core significantly outperforms existing pure software LUT implementations and achieves a 1.44$\times$ improvement in compute density and energy efficiency compared to previous state-of-the-art LUT-based accelerators.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference Version (ISCA'25).

| **[LLM-Based Repair of Static Nullability Errors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20674v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern Java projects increasingly adopt static analysis tools that prevent null-pointer exceptions by treating nullness as a type property. However, integrating such tools into large, existing codebases remains a significant challenge. While annotation inference can eliminate many errors automatically, a subset of residual errors -- typically a mix of real bugs and false positives -- often persist and can only be resolved via code changes. Manually addressing these errors is tedious and error-prone. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising path toward automating these repairs, but naively-prompted LLMs often generate incorrect, contextually-inappropriate edits. Resolving a nullability error demands a deep understanding of how a symbol is used across the codebase, often spanning methods, classes, and packages. We present NullRepair, a system that integrates LLMs into a structured workflow for resolving the errors from a nullability checker. NullRepair's decision process follows a flowchart derived from manual analysis of 200 real-world errors. It leverages static analysis to identify safe and unsafe usage regions of symbols, using error-free usage examples to contextualize model prompts. Patches are generated through an iterative interaction with the LLM that incorporates project-wide context and decision logic. Our evaluation on 12 real-world Java projects shows that NullRepair resolves an average of 72% of the errors that remain after applying a state-of-the-art annotation inference technique. Unlike a naively-prompted LLM, NullRepair also largely preserves program semantics, with all unit tests passing in 10/12 projects after applying every edit proposed by NullRepair, and 98% or more tests passing in the remaining two projects.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geometric-Mean Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20673v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models by optimizing the arithmetic mean of token-level rewards. However, GRPO suffers from unstable policy updates when processing tokens with outlier importance-weighted rewards, which manifests as extreme importance sampling ratios during training, i.e., the ratio between the sampling probabilities assigned to a token by the current and old policies. In this work, we propose Geometric-Mean Policy Optimization (GMPO), a stabilized variant of GRPO. Instead of optimizing the arithmetic mean, GMPO maximizes the geometric mean of token-level rewards, which is inherently less sensitive to outliers and maintains a more stable range of importance sampling ratio. In addition, we provide comprehensive theoretical and experimental analysis to justify the design and stability benefits of GMPO. Beyond improved stability, GMPO-7B outperforms GRPO by an average of 4.1% on multiple mathematical benchmarks and 1.4% on multimodal reasoning benchmark, including AIME24, AMC, MATH500, OlympiadBench, Minerva, and Geometry3K.

Conventional keyword-based data augmentation methods often produce unrealistic sounds due to their reliance on manually defined labels, limiting scalability as machine types and anomaly patterns diversify. Advanced audio generative models, such as MIMII-Gen, show promise but typically depend on anomalous training data, making them less effective when diverse anomalous examples are unavailable. To address these limitations, we propose a novel synthesis approach leveraging large language models (LLMs) to interpret textual descriptions of faults and automatically select audio transformation functions, converting normal machine sounds into diverse and plausible anomalous sounds. We validate this approach by evaluating a UASD system trained only on normal sounds from five machine types, using both real and synthetic anomaly data. Experimental results reveal consistent trends in relative detection difficulty across machine types between synthetic and real anomalies. This finding supports our hypothesis and highlights the effectiveness of the proposed LLM-based synthesis approach for relative evaluation of UASD systems.</p></details> |  |

However, it remains challenging due to the multifaceted evaluation criteria involved, such as creativity and peer-comparative achievement. Meanwhile, instructors often struggle to maintain fairness throughout the time-consuming grading process. Recent advances in AI, particularly large language models, have demonstrated potential for automating simpler grading tasks, such as assessing quizzes or basic writing quality. However, these tools often fall short when it comes to complex metrics, like design innovation and the practical application of knowledge, that require an instructor's educational insights into the class situation. To address this challenge, we conducted a formative study with six instructors and developed CoGrader, which introduces a novel grading workflow combining human-LLM collaborative metrics design, benchmarking, and AI-assisted feedback. CoGrader was found effective in improving grading efficiency and consistency while providing reliable peer-comparative feedback to students. We also discuss design insights and ethical considerations for the development of human-AI collaborative grading systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ontology-Enhanced Knowledge Graph Completion using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20643v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively adopted in Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC), showcasing significant research advancements. However, as black-box models driven by deep neural architectures, current LLM-based KGC methods rely on implicit knowledge representation with parallel propagation of erroneous knowledge, thereby hindering their ability to produce conclusive and decisive reasoning outcomes. We aim to integrate neural-perceptual structural information with ontological knowledge, leveraging the powerful capabilities of LLMs to achieve a deeper understanding of the intrinsic logic of the knowledge. We propose an ontology enhanced KGC method using LLMs -- OL-KGC. It first leverages neural perceptual mechanisms to effectively embed structural information into the textual space, and then uses an automated extraction algorithm to retrieve ontological knowledge from the knowledge graphs (KGs) that needs to be completed, which is further transformed into a textual format comprehensible to LLMs for providing logic guidance. We conducted extensive experiments on three widely-used benchmarks -- FB15K-237, UMLS and WN18RR. The experimental results demonstrate that OL-KGC significantly outperforms existing mainstream KGC methods across multiple evaluation metrics, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpecASR: Accelerating LLM-based Automatic Speech Recognition via Speculative Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18181v2)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM)-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) has recently attracted a lot of attention due to its high recognition accuracy and enhanced multi-dialect support. However, the high decoding latency of LLMs challenges the real-time ASR requirements. Although speculative decoding has been explored for better decoding efficiency, they usually ignore the key characteristics of the ASR task and achieve limited speedup. To further reduce the real-time ASR latency, in this paper, we propose a novel speculative decoding framework specialized for ASR, dubbed SpecASR. SpecASR is developed based on our core observation that ASR decoding is audio-conditioned, which results in high output alignment between small and large ASR models, even given output mismatches in intermediate decoding steps. Therefore, SpecASR features an adaptive draft sequence generation process that dynamically modifies the draft sequence length to maximize the token acceptance length. SpecASR further proposes a draft sequence recycling strategy that reuses the previously generated draft sequence to reduce the draft ASR model latency. Moreover, a two-pass sparse token tree generation algorithm is also proposed to balance the latency of draft and target ASR models. With extensive experimental results, we demonstrate SpecASR achieves 3.04x-3.79x and 1.25x-1.84x speedup over the baseline autoregressive decoding and speculative decoding, respectively, without any loss in recognition accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Design Automation Conference (DAC) 2025</p></details> |

However, applying LLM agents to drug discovery is still constrained by challenges such as large-scale multimodal data processing, limited task automation, and poor support for domain-specific tools. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DrugPilot, a LLM-based agent system with a parameterized reasoning architecture designed for end-to-end scientific workflows in drug discovery. DrugPilot enables multi-stage research processes by integrating structured tool use with a novel parameterized memory pool. The memory pool converts heterogeneous data from both public sources and user-defined inputs into standardized representations. This design supports efficient multi-turn dialogue, reduces information loss during data exchange, and enhances complex scientific decision-making. To support training and benchmarking, we construct a drug instruction dataset covering eight core drug discovery tasks. Under the Berkeley function-calling benchmark, DrugPilot significantly outperforms state-of-the-art agents such as ReAct and LoT, achieving task completion rates of 98.0%, 93.5%, and 64.0% for simple, multi-tool, and multi-turn scenarios, respectively. These results highlight DrugPilot's potential as a versatile agent framework for computational science domains requiring automated, interactive, and data-integrated reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Interactions: Node-Level Graph Generation for Knowledge-Free Augmentation in Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20578v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in recommender systems rely on external resources such as knowledge graphs or large language models to enhance recommendations, which limit applicability in real-world settings due to data dependency and computational overhead. Although knowledge-free models are able to bolster recommendations by direct edge operations as well, the absence of augmentation primitives drives them to fall short in bridging semantic and structural gaps as high-quality paradigm substitutes. Unlike existing diffusion-based works that remodel user-item interactions, this work proposes NodeDiffRec, a pioneering knowledge-free augmentation framework that enables fine-grained node-level graph generation for recommendations and expands the scope of restricted augmentation primitives via diffusion. By synthesizing pseudo-items and corresponding interactions that align with the underlying distribution for injection, and further refining user preferences through a denoising preference modeling process, NodeDiffRec dramatically enhances both semantic diversity and structural connectivity without external knowledge. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and recommendation algorithms demonstrate the superiority of NodeDiffRec, achieving State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance, with maximum average performance improvement 98.6% in Recall@5 and 84.0% in NDCG@5 over selected baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[LIMO: Less is More for Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03387v2)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We challenge the prevailing assumption that complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs) necessitates massive training data. We demonstrate that sophisticated mathematical reasoning can emerge with only a few examples. Specifically, through simple supervised fine-tuning, our model, LIMO, achieves 63.3\% accuracy on AIME24 and 95.6\% on MATH500, surpassing previous fine-tuned models (6.5\% on AIME24, 59.2\% on MATH500) while using only 1\% of the training data required by prior approaches. Furthermore, LIMO exhibits strong out-of-distribution generalization, achieving a 45.8\% absolute improvement across diverse benchmarks, outperforming models trained on 100x more data. Synthesizing these findings, we propose the Less-Is-More Reasoning Hypothesis (LIMO Hypothesis): In foundation models where domain knowledge has been comprehensively encoded during pre-training, sophisticated reasoning can emerge through minimal but strategically designed demonstrations of cognitive processes. This hypothesis suggests that the threshold for eliciting complex reasoning is not dictated by task complexity but rather by two key factors: (1) the completeness of the model's pre-trained knowledge base and (2) the effectiveness of post-training examples in serving as "cognitive templates" that guide reasoning.</p></details> | COLM 2025 |

We present SiriusBI, a practical LLM-powered BI system addressing the challenges of industrial deployments through three key innovations: (a) An end-to-end architecture integrating multi-module coordination to overcome functionality gaps in legacy systems; (b) A multi-round dialogue with querying mechanism, consisting of semantic completion, knowledge-guided clarification, and proactive querying processes, to resolve interaction constraints in SQL generation; (c) A data-conditioned SQL generation method selection strategy that supports both an efficient one-step Fine-Tuning approach and a two-step method leveraging Semantic Intermediate Representation for low-cost cross-domain applications. Experiments on both real-world datasets and public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of SiriusBI. User studies further confirm that SiriusBI enhances both productivity and user experience. As an independent service on Tencent's data platform, SiriusBI is deployed across finance, advertising, and cloud sectors, serving dozens of enterprise clients. It achieves over 93% accuracy in SQL generation and reduces data analysts' query time from minutes to seconds in real-world applications.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

These challenges have historically impeded the efficiency and scalability of Cel-Animation production. The rise of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), encompassing large language models, multimodal models, and diffusion models, offers innovative solutions by automating tasks such as inbetween frame generation, colorization, and storyboard creation. This survey explores how GenAI integration is revolutionizing traditional animation workflows by lowering technical barriers, broadening accessibility for a wider range of creators through tools like AniDoc, ToonCrafter, and AniSora, and enabling artists to focus more on creative expression and artistic innovation. Despite its potential, challenges like visual consistency, stylistic coherence, and ethical considerations persist.

This trend underscores the urgent need for systematic evaluation methodologies to assess LLMs generation capabilities in geospatial contexts. In particular, geospatial computation and visualization tasks in JavaScript environments rely heavily on orchestrating diverse frontend libraries and ecosystems, placing elevated demands on a model's semantic understanding and code synthesis abilities. To address this challenge, we propose GeoJSEval--the first multimodal, function-level automatic evaluation framework for LLMs in JavaScript-based geospatial code generation. GeoJSEval comprises three core components: a standardized test suite (GeoJSEval-Bench), a code submission engine, and an evaluation module. It includes 432 function-level tasks and 2,071 structured test cases spanning five widely used JavaScript geospatial libraries and 25 mainstream geospatial data types. GeoJSEval enables multidimensional quantitative evaluation across metrics such as accuracy, output stability, execution efficiency, resource consumption, and error type distribution, and integrates boundary testing mechanisms to enhance robustness and coverage. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 18 state-of-the-art LLMs using GeoJSEval, revealing significant performance disparities and bottlenecks in spatial semantic understanding, code reliability, and function invocation accuracy. GeoJSEval provides a foundational methodology, evaluation resource, and practical toolkit for the standardized assessment and optimization of geospatial code generation models, with strong extensibility and applicability in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose Togedule, an adaptive scheduling tool that uses large language models to dynamically adjust the pool of choices and their presentation format. With the initial prototype, we conducted a formative study (N=10) and identified the potential benefits and risks of such an adaptive scheduling tool. Then, after enhancing the system, we conducted two controlled experiments, one each for attendees and organizers (total N=66).

As users increasingly encounter such black-box outputs, detecting hallucinations has become a critical challenge. To address this challenge, we focus on developing a hallucination detection framework for black-box generators. Motivated by the observation that hallucinations, once introduced, tend to persist, we sample future contexts. The sampled future contexts provide valuable clues for hallucination detection and can be effectively integrated with various sampling-based methods. We extensively demonstrate performance improvements across multiple methods using our proposed sampling approach.</p></details> |  |

Traditional evolutionary methods operate directly on heuristic code; in contrast, MeLA evolves the instructional prompts used to guide a Large Language Model (LLM) in generating these heuristics. This process of "prompt evolution" is driven by a novel metacognitive framework where the system analyzes performance feedback to systematically refine its generative strategy. MeLA's architecture integrates a problem analyzer to construct an initial strategic prompt, an error diagnosis system to repair faulty code, and a metacognitive search engine that iteratively optimizes the prompt based on heuristic effectiveness. In comprehensive experiments across both benchmark and real-world problems, MeLA consistently generates more effective and robust heuristics, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Ultimately, this research demonstrates the profound potential of using cognitive science as a blueprint for AI architecture, revealing that by enabling an LLM to metacognitively regulate its problem-solving process, we unlock a more robust and interpretable path to AHD.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Answers to Rationales: Self-Aligning Multimodal Reasoning with Answer-Oriented Chain-of-Thought](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02984v2)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving human-like reasoning capabilities in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has long been a goal. Current methods primarily focus on synthesizing positive rationales, typically relying on manual annotations or complex systems. Moreover, they often overlook negative reasoning, which limits the model's generalization ability and robustness in multimodal inference. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework: \textbf{S}elf-Aligning \textbf{M}ultimodal Reasoning with \textbf{A}nswer-O\textbf{r}iented Chain-of-\textbf{T}hought (SMART). SMART employs an answer-oriented chain-of-thought (AoT) prompt to automatically construct high-quality data. Drawing inspiration from human proof-based strategies, AoT leverages both correct and incorrect answers to extract key visual information that links questions and answers. When provided with correct answers, the model produces strong positive rationales. Conversely, when correct answers are replaced with incorrect alternatives, the model generates an erroneous yet compelling reasoning path, serving as a form of discriminative negative rationale. Models trained with AoT-generated data outperform those trained on manually annotated datasets, demonstrating superior reasoning capabilities. Consequently, SMART establishes an iterative generation-optimization method that continually enhances the model's reasoning skills. Experiments indicate that the SMART framework significantly improves various MLLMs, regardless of model architecture, parameter size, or pre-training dataset. The code is available at https://github.com/WentaoTan/SMART.</p></details> |  |

Supervised methods require an amount of in-domain training data and often struggle to generalize to unseen anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods leverage the intrinsic world knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to detect anomalies but face challenges in localizing fine-grained visual transitions and diverse events. Therefore, we propose EventVAD, an event-aware video anomaly detection framework that combines tailored dynamic graph architectures and multimodal LLMs through temporal-event reasoning. Specifically, EventVAD first employs dynamic spatiotemporal graph modeling with time-decay constraints to capture event-aware video features. Then, it performs adaptive noise filtering and uses signal ratio thresholding to detect event boundaries via unsupervised statistical features. The statistical boundary detection module reduces the complexity of processing long videos for MLLMs and improves their temporal reasoning through event consistency. Finally, it utilizes a hierarchical prompting strategy to guide MLLMs in performing reasoning before determining final decisions. We conducted extensive experiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets. The results demonstrate that EventVAD with a 7B MLLM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) in training-free settings, outperforming strong baselines that use 7B or larger MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper was accepted by ACM MM 2025; Code: https://github.com/YihuaJerry/EventVAD</p></details> |

While techniques such as automatic prompt engineering, controlled text embeddings, denoising, and multi-turn generation mitigate these issues, they offer limited controllability, or often necessitate additional training, restricting the generalization abilities. Thus, we introduce T2I-Copilot, a training-free multi-agent system that leverages collaboration between (Multimodal) Large Language Models to automate prompt phrasing, model selection, and iterative refinement. This approach significantly simplifies prompt engineering while enhancing generation quality and text-image alignment compared to direct generation. Specifically, T2I-Copilot consists of three agents: (1) Input Interpreter, which parses the input prompt, resolves ambiguities, and generates a standardized report; (2) Generation Engine, which selects the appropriate model from different types of T2I models and organizes visual and textual prompts to initiate generation; and (3) Quality Evaluator, which assesses aesthetic quality and text-image alignment, providing scores and feedback for potential regeneration. T2I-Copilot can operate fully autonomously while also supporting human-in-the-loop intervention for fine-grained control. On GenAI-Bench, using open-source generation models, T2I-Copilot achieves a VQA score comparable to commercial models RecraftV3 and Imagen 3, surpasses FLUX1.1-pro by 6.17% at only 16.59% of its cost, and outperforms FLUX.1-dev and SD 3.5 Large by 9.11% and 6.36%.

However, the underlying relationships and domain knowledge remain fragmented across literature and static databases that often require expert-level queries, limiting their applicability in design and planning. To address these limitations, we develop a novel and structured knowledge graph (KG), representing 53 distinct metals and alloys across seven material categories, nine AM processes, four feedstock types, and corresponding post-processing requirements. A large language model (LLM) interface, guided by a few-shot prompting strategy, enables natural language querying without the need for formal query syntax. The system supports a range of tasks, including compatibility evaluation, constraint-based filtering, and design for AM (DfAM) guidance. User queries in natural language are normalized, translated into Cypher, and executed on the KG, with results returned in a structured format.

However, the development of performant mathematical LLMs is critically bottlenecked by the scarcity of difficult, novel training data. We introduce \textbf{SAND-Math} (Synthetic Augmented Novel and Difficult Mathematics problems and solutions), a pipeline that addresses this by first generating high-quality problems from scratch and then systematically elevating their complexity via a new \textbf{Difficulty Hiking} step. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through two key findings. First, augmenting a strong baseline with SAND-Math data significantly boosts performance, outperforming the next-best synthetic dataset by \textbf{$\uparrow$ 17.85 absolute points} on the AIME25 benchmark. Second, in a dedicated ablation study, we show our Difficulty Hiking process is highly effective: by increasing average problem difficulty from 5.02 to 5.98, this step lifts AIME25 performance from 46.38\% to 49.23\%. The full generation pipeline, final dataset, and a fine-tuned model form a practical and scalable toolkit for building more capable and efficient mathematical reasoning LLMs. SAND-Math dataset is released here: \href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/amd/SAND-MATH}{https://huggingface.co/datasets/amd/SAND-MATH}</p></details> |  |
| **[Accidental Vulnerability: Factors in Fine-Tuning that Shift Model Safeguards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16789v2)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) gain popularity, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks emerges as a primary concern. While fine-tuning models on domain-specific datasets is often employed to improve model performance, it can inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities within the underlying model. In this work, we investigate Accidental Vulnerability, unexpected vulnerabilities arising from characteristics of fine-tuning data. We begin by identifying potential correlation factors such as linguistic features, semantic similarity, and toxicity across multiple experimental datasets. We then evaluate the adversarial robustness of these fine-tuned models, analyzing persona shifts and interpretability traits to understand how dataset factors contribute to attack success rates. Lastly, we explore causal relationships that offer new insights into adversarial defense strategies, highlighting the crucial role of dataset design in preserving model alignment.

The conceptual subtlety, rich imagery, and density of allusion found in the text make it hard to causally dismiss on account of its mechanistic origin. This raises questions about how we, as a society, should come to terms with the potentially unsettling possibility of a technology that encroaches on human meaning-making. We suggest that Buddhist philosophy, by its very nature, is well placed to adapt.</p></details> |  |

As the industry expands to meet rising demand, it faces growing challenges such as disease outbreaks, inefficient feeding practices, rising labor costs, logistical inefficiencies, and critical hatchery issues, including high mortality rates and poor water quality control. Although artificial intelligence has made significant progress, existing machine learning methods fall short of addressing the domain-specific complexities of aquaculture. To bridge this gap, we introduce AQUA, the first large language model (LLM) tailored for aquaculture, designed to support farmers, researchers, and industry practitioners. Central to this effort is AQUADAPT (Data Acquisition, Processing and Tuning), an Agentic Framework for generating and refining high-quality synthetic data using a combination of expert knowledge, largescale language models, and automated evaluation techniques. Our work lays the foundation for LLM-driven innovations in aquaculture research, advisory systems, and decision-making tools.</p></details> |  |

However, Tibetan, as a representative low-resource language, is particularly underrepresented in existing models due to the scarcity of high-quality training corpora. To address this gap, we curate the largest Tibetan pre-training corpus to date, aggregating data from diverse sources and applying a dedicated data cleaning and processing pipeline tailored for Tibetan. With the curated data, we continue pre/post-training a multilingual base model to enhance its generative capabilities in Tibetan. To evaluate the Tibetan capabilities of the model, we create new high-quality Tibetan benchmarks, and complement them with existing public benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our model consistently and significantly outperforms both open-source models of similar scale and Tibetan-tailored models across a wide range of tasks.</p></details> |  |

Recent CLIP-like methods based on contrastive language-image pertaining mitigate the issue by leveraging textual representation of the class name for unseen image discovery. Despite the achieved success, simply aligning visual representations to class name embeddings would compromise the visual diversity for novel class discrimination. To this end, we proposed a novel Few-Shot Learning (FSL) method (BCT-CLIP) that explores \textbf{dominating properties} via contrastive learning beyond simply using class tokens. Through leveraging LLM-based prior knowledge, our method pushes forward FSL with comprehensive structural image representations, including both global category representation and the patch-aware property embeddings. In particular, we presented a novel multi-property generator (MPG) with patch-aware cross-attentions to generate multiple visual property tokens, a Large-Language Model (LLM)-assistant retrieval procedure with clustering-based pruning to obtain dominating property descriptions, and a new contrastive learning strategy for property-token learning. The superior performances on the 11 widely used datasets demonstrate that our investigation of dominating properties advances discriminative class-specific representation learning and few-shot classification.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |

Most existing work focuses on high-level tasks such as task decomposition. A few studies have explored the use of LLMs in feedback controller design; however, these efforts are restricted to overly simplified systems, fixed-structure gain tuning, and lack real-world validation. To further investigate LLMs in automatic control, this work targets a key subfield: adaptive control. Inspired by the framework of model reference adaptive control (MRAC), we propose an LLM-guided adaptive compensator framework that avoids designing controllers from scratch. Instead, the LLMs are prompted using the discrepancies between an unknown system and a reference system to design a compensator that aligns the response of the unknown system with that of the reference, thereby achieving adaptivity. Experiments evaluate five methods: LLM-guided adaptive compensator, LLM-guided adaptive controller, indirect adaptive control, learning-based adaptive control, and MRAC, on soft and humanoid robots in both simulated and real-world environments. Results show that the LLM-guided adaptive compensator outperforms traditional adaptive controllers and significantly reduces reasoning complexity compared to the LLM-guided adaptive controller. The Lyapunov-based analysis and reasoning-path inspection demonstrate that the LLM-guided adaptive compensator enables a more structured design process by transforming mathematical derivation into a reasoning task, while exhibiting strong generalizability, adaptability, and robustness. This study opens a new direction for applying LLMs in the field of automatic control, offering greater deployability and practicality compared to vision-language models.</p></details> |  |

While state-of-the-art applications like ChatGPT or GPT-4 commonly employ Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), the inclusion of a critic network introduces significant computational overhead. REINFORCE-based methods, such as REINFORCE Leave One-Out (RLOO), ReMax, and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), address this limitation by eliminating the critic network. However, these approaches face challenges in accurate advantage estimation. Specifically, they estimate advantages independently for responses to each prompt, which can lead to overfitting on simpler prompts and vulnerability to reward hacking and may be biased. To address these challenges, we introduce REINFORCE++, a novel approach that removes the critic model while using the global advantage normalization which is unbiased to improve the training stability. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that REINFORCE++ exhibits robust performance across various reward models without requiring prompt set truncation. Furthermore, it achieves superior generalization in both RLHF and long chain-of-thought (CoT) settings compared to existing REINFORCE-based methods. The implementation is available at https://github.com/OpenRLHF/OpenRLHF.</p></details> | add experiments |

However, in closed-domain scenarios such as education, healthcare, and law, users demand not only accurate answers but also transparent reasoning and explainable decision-making processes. While neural-symbolic (NeSy) frameworks have emerged as a promising solution, leveraging LLMs for natural language understanding and symbolic systems for formal reasoning, existing approaches often rely on large-scale models and exhibit inefficiencies in translating natural language into formal logic representations. To address these limitations, we introduce Text-JEPA (Text-based Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture), a lightweight yet effective framework for converting natural language into first-order logic (NL2FOL). Drawing inspiration from dual-system cognitive theory, Text-JEPA emulates System 1 by efficiently generating logic representations, while the Z3 solver operates as System 2, enabling robust logical inference. To rigorously evaluate the NL2FOL-to-reasoning pipeline, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework comprising three custom metrics: conversion score, reasoning score, and Spearman rho score, which collectively capture the quality of logical translation and its downstream impact on reasoning accuracy. Empirical results on domain-specific datasets demonstrate that Text-JEPA achieves competitive performance with significantly lower computational overhead compared to larger LLM-based systems. Our findings highlight the potential of structured, interpretable reasoning frameworks for building efficient and explainable QA systems in specialized domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures.

Two strategies have emerged to address this issue: domain specialization and pretraining with high-quality data. To explore these strategies, we specialized the Mistral-7B model with 1.9 billion unique tokens from reputable Brazilian legal sources and conducted few-shot evaluations on legal and general knowledge test suites. Our model, Juru, demonstrates the benefits of domain specialization by achieving improved performance on legal benchmarks, even with a reduced amount of pretraining data. However, this domain specialization through continued pretraining comes at the cost of increased forgetting in unrelated domains, as evidenced by performance degradation on general knowledge test suites in both Portuguese and English. This study contributes to the growing body of scientific evidence showing that pretraining data selection may enhance the performance of large language models, enabling the exploration of these models at a lower cost.

The moment users share information with these agents-such as large language models (LLMs)-their private information becomes vulnerable to exposure. In this paper, we characterize the notion of contextual privacy for user interactions with LLM-based Conversational Agents (LCAs). It aims to minimize privacy risks by ensuring that users (sender) disclose only information that is both relevant and necessary for achieving their intended goals when interacting with LCAs (untrusted receivers). Through a formative design user study, we observe how even "privacy-conscious" users inadvertently reveal sensitive information through indirect disclosures. Based on insights from this study, we propose a locally deployable framework that operates between users and LCAs, identifying and reformulating out-of-context information in user prompts. Our evaluation using examples from ShareGPT shows that lightweight models can effectively implement this framework, achieving strong gains in contextual privacy while preserving the user's intended interaction goals. Notably, about 76% of participants in our human evaluation preferred the reformulated prompts over the original ones, validating the usability and effectiveness of contextual privacy in our proposed framework. We opensource the code at https://github.com/IBM/contextual-privacy-LLM.</p></details> | 22 pages, 2 figures |

However, retrieval noises significantly impact the quality of LLMs' generation, necessitating the development of denoising mechanisms. Previous methods extract evidence straightforwardly without explicit thinking, which risks filtering out key clues and struggles with generalization. To this end, we propose LEAR, which learns to extract rational evidence by (1) explicitly reasoning to identify potential cues within retrieval contents first, and then (2) consciously extracting to avoid omitting any key cues helpful for answering questions. Specifically, we frame evidence reasoning and evidence extraction into one unified response for end-to-end training; apply knowledge token masks for disentanglement to derive reasoning-based and extraction-based answers; and devise three types of verifiable reward functions, including answer, length, and format, to update the model via the policy optimization algorithm. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of LEAR, providing compact and high-quality evidence, improving the accuracy of downstream tasks, and promoting effective application in online RAG systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 Figures, 10 Tables</p></details> |

The system operates in two phases. First, extracting text transcripts from video frames using a Vision-Language Model (VLM). Next, processing questions using these transcripts to generate answers through a Large Language Model (LLM). This design ensures image privacy by deploying the VLM on edge devices and the LLM in the cloud. To improve transcript quality, we propose grid-based visual prompting, which extracts intricate local details from each grid cell and integrates them with global information. Evaluation results show that Grid-LoGAT, using the open-source VLM (LLaVA-1.6-7B) and LLM (Llama-3.1-8B), outperforms state-of-the-art methods with similar baseline models on NExT-QA and STAR-QA datasets with an accuracy of 65.9% and 50.11% respectively. Additionally, our method surpasses the non-grid version by 24 points on localization-based questions we created using NExT-QA.

Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple, yet effective alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Synthetic preference data with its low cost and high quality enable effective alignment through single- or multi-model generated preference data. Our study reveals a striking, safety-specific phenomenon associated with DPO alignment: Although multi-model generated data enhances performance on general tasks (ARC, Hellaswag, MMLU, TruthfulQA, Winogrande) by providing diverse responses, it also tends to facilitate reward hacking during training. This can lead to a high attack success rate (ASR) when models encounter jailbreaking prompts. The issue is particularly pronounced when employing stronger models like GPT-4o or larger models in the same family to generate chosen responses paired with target model self-generated rejected responses, resulting in dramatically poorer safety outcomes. Furthermore, with respect to safety, using solely self-generated responses (single-model generation) for both chosen and rejected pairs significantly outperforms configurations that incorporate responses from stronger models, whether used directly as chosen data or as part of a multi-model response pool. We demonstrate that multi-model preference data exhibits high linear separability between chosen and rejected responses, which allows models to exploit superficial cues rather than internalizing robust safety constraints. Our experiments, conducted on models from the Llama, Mistral, and Qwen families, consistently validate these findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version includes updated results and expanded discussion</p></details> |

External memory mechanisms have been proposed to address this limitation, enabling LLMs to maintain conversational continuity. However, existing approaches struggle with two key challenges. First, rigid memory granularity fails to capture the natural semantic structure of conversations, leading to fragmented and incomplete representations. Second, fixed retrieval mechanisms cannot adapt to diverse dialogue contexts and user interaction patterns. In this work, we propose Reflective Memory Management (RMM), a novel mechanism for long-term dialogue agents, integrating forward- and backward-looking reflections: (1) Prospective Reflection, which dynamically summarizes interactions across granularities-utterances, turns, and sessions-into a personalized memory bank for effective future retrieval, and (2) Retrospective Reflection, which iteratively refines the retrieval in an online reinforcement learning (RL) manner based on LLMs' cited evidence. Experiments show that RMM demonstrates consistent improvement across various metrics and benchmarks. For example, RMM shows more than 10% accuracy improvement over the baseline without memory management on the LongMemEval dataset.</p></details> | Accepted to ACL 2025 |

However, in practice, task descriptions frequently exhibit ambiguity, incompleteness, or internal contradictions. In this paper, we present the first empirical study examining the robustness of state-of-the-art code generation models when faced with such unclear task descriptions. We extend the HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks by systematically introducing realistic task descriptions flaws through guided mutation strategies, producing a dataset that mirrors the messiness of informal developer instructions. We evaluate multiple LLMs of varying sizes and architectures, analyzing their functional correctness and failure modes across task descriptions categories. Our findings reveal that even minor imperfections in task description phrasing can cause significant performance degradation, with contradictory task descriptions resulting in numerous logical errors. Moreover, while larger models tend to be more resilient than smaller variants, they are not immune to the challenges posed by unclear requirements. We further analyze semantic error patterns and identify correlations between description clarity, model behavior, and error types. Our results underscore the critical need for developing LLMs that are not only powerful but also robust to the imperfections inherent in natural user tasks, highlighting important considerations for improving model training strategies, designing more realistic evaluation benchmarks, and ensuring reliable deployment in practical software development environments.</p></details> |  |

Although previous approaches have successfully generated candidate named entity spans with suitable labels, they rely solely on input context information when using LLMs, particularly, ChatGPT. However, NER inherently requires capturing detailed labeling requirements with input context information. To address this issue, we propose a novel method that leverages code-based prompting to improve the capabilities of LLMs in understanding and performing NER. By embedding code within prompts, we provide detailed BIO schema instructions for labeling, thereby exploiting the ability of LLMs to comprehend long-range scopes in programming languages. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed code-based prompting method outperforms conventional text-based prompting on ten benchmarks across English, Arabic, Finnish, Danish, and German datasets, indicating the effectiveness of explicitly structuring NER instructions. We also verify that combining the proposed code-based prompting method with the chain-of-thought prompting further improves performance.</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |

However, despite their strong performance across many benchmarks, LLM-based agents might still lack conversational skills such as disambiguation -- when they are faced with ambiguity, they often overhedge or implicitly guess users' true intents rather than asking clarification questions. Under task-specific settings, high-quality conversation samples are often limited, constituting a bottleneck for LLMs' ability to learn optimal dialogue action policies. We propose Action-Based Contrastive Self-Training (ACT), a quasi-online preference optimization algorithm based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), that enables data-efficient dialogue policy learning in multi-turn conversation modeling. We demonstrate ACT's efficacy under in data-efficient tuning scenarios, even when there is no action label available, using multiple real-world conversational tasks: tabular-grounded question-answering, machine reading comprehension, and AmbigSQL, a novel task for disambiguating information-seeking requests for complex SQL generation towards data analysis agents. Additionally, we propose evaluating LLMs' ability to function as conversational agents by examining whether they can implicitly recognize and reason about ambiguity in conversation. ACT demonstrates substantial conversation modeling improvements over standard tuning approaches like supervised fine-tuning and DPO.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025; Code: https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/learning_to_clarify</p></details> |

Similar paradigm shifts have occurred in the past with the introduction of search engines and Wikipedia, which replaced or supplemented traditional information sources such as libraries and books. This study investigates the potential for LLMs to represent the next shift in learning, focusing on their role in information discovery and synthesis compared to existing technologies, such as search engines. Using a within-subjects, counterbalanced design, participants learned new topics using a search engine (Google) and an LLM (ChatGPT). Post-task follow-up interviews explored students' reflections, preferences, pain points, and overall perceptions. We present analysis of their responses that show nuanced insights into when, why, and how students prefer LLMs over search engines, offering implications for educators, policymakers, and technology developers navigating the evolving educational landscape.</p></details> |  |

Compared to human-engineered features, these embeddings provide automatic and effective representations for classification model training. However, they also introduce a challenge: we lose the ability to manually remove unintended features, such as sensitive or task-irrelevant features, to guarantee regulatory compliance or improve the generalizability of classification models. This limitation arises because LLM embeddings are opaque and difficult to interpret. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to identify and regularize unintended features in the LLM latent space. Specifically, we first pre-train a sparse autoencoder (SAE) to extract interpretable features from LLM latent spaces. To ensure the SAE can capture task-specific features, we further fine-tune it on task-specific datasets. In training the classification model, we propose a simple and effective regularizer, by minimizing the similarity between the classifier weights and the identified unintended feature, to remove the impact of these unintended features on classification. We evaluate the proposed framework on three real-world tasks, including toxic chat detection, reward modeling, and disease diagnosis. Results show that the proposed self-regularization framework can improve the classifier's generalizability by regularizing those features that are not semantically correlated to the task. This work pioneers controllable text classification on LLM latent spaces by leveraging interpreted features to address generalizability, fairness, and privacy challenges.

Previous studies reported that migration across CI services is a recurring need in open-source development. However, manual migration can be time-consuming and error-prone. The state-of-the-art approach, CIMig, addresses this challenge by analyzing past migration examples to create service-specific rules and produce equivalent configurations across CI services. However, its relatively low accuracy raises concerns about the overall feasibility of automated CI migration using rule-based techniques alone. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in code generation and transformation tasks, suggesting potential to improve the automation, usability, and generalizability of CI configuration migration. This registered report presents a study in which we aim to assess whether CI migration can be improved using LLMs. To this end, we propose CIgrate, an LLM-based framework for automatically migrating CI configurations. We plan to evaluate the performance of CIgrate compared to CIMig as a baseline, in different setups (a) zero-shot/few-shot prompting of LLMs for configuration migration and (b) fine-tuning an LLM on a dataset of already established CI service migrations. We will also seek developer feedback on the quality and usability of the generated configurations. We formulate research questions focusing on the accuracy of LLM-generated migrations versus ground truth and the output of CIMig. The expected contributions include the first LLM-powered approach for CI service migration, a comparative evaluation of its effectiveness compared to rule-based approaches, and insight into leveraging LLMs to support software configuration evolution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Regis...</summary><p>Registered Report Accepted at the 41st IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution 2025 (ICSME'25)</p></details> |

Although LLMs can control output sequence length, particularly in instruction-based settings, the internal mechanisms behind this control have been unexplored yet. In this study, we provide empirical evidence on how output sequence length information is encoded within the internal representations in LLMs. In particular, our findings show that multi-head attention mechanisms are critical in determining output sequence length, which can be adjusted in a disentangled manner. By scaling specific hidden units within the model, we can control the output sequence length without losing the informativeness of the generated text, thereby indicating that length information is partially disentangled from semantic information. Moreover, some hidden units become increasingly active as prompts become more length-specific, thus reflecting the model's internal awareness of this attribute. Our findings suggest that LLMs have learned robust and adaptable internal mechanisms for controlling output length without any external control.</p></details> |  |

Despite advances in language understanding, current research lacks evaluation of how LLMs perform spatial navigation without visual cues, a fundamental requirement for agents operating with limited sensory information. This paper addresses this gap by introducing MazeEval, a benchmark designed to isolate and evaluate pure spatial reasoning in LLMs through coordinate-based maze navigation tasks. Our methodology employs a function-calling interface where models navigate mazes of varying complexity ($5\times 5$ to $15\times 15$ grids) using only coordinate feedback and distance-to-wall information, excluding visual input to test fundamental spatial cognition. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs across identical mazes in both English and Icelandic to assess cross-linguistic transfer of spatial abilities. Our findings reveal striking disparities: while OpenAI's O3 achieves perfect navigation for mazes up to size $30\times 30$, other models exhibit catastrophic failure beyond $9\times 9$ mazes, with 100% of failures attributed to excessive looping behavior where models revisit a cell at least 10 times. We document a significant performance degradation in Icelandic, with models solving mazes 3-4 sizes smaller than in English, suggesting spatial reasoning in LLMs emerges from linguistic patterns rather than language-agnostic mechanisms. These results have important implications for global deployment of LLM-powered autonomous systems, showing spatial intelligence remains fundamentally constrained by training data availability and highlighting the need for architectural innovations to achieve reliable navigation across linguistic contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Review of LLM-Assisted Ideation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00946v3)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a comprehensive, in-depth review of ideation assisted by large language models (LLMs), highlighting emerging trends and identifying unaddressed research gaps. In total, we examined 61 studies investigating the application of LLMs in both group and individual ideation processes. From these studies, we derived the Hourglass Ideation Framework for LLM-assisted ideation, comprising three phases and seven key ideation stages, which served as the basis for our systematic survey. Our analysis reveals that LLMs are most frequently used for idea generation and refinement, but their use in scope specification, foundational material structuring and multi-idea evaluation and selection remains limited. We provide our findings in extensive tabular and online formats. These catalogues detail research on LLM-assisted, purely LLM-based, and human-only activities across the seven ideation stages for each of the 61 studies. These also detail creative domains, publication outlets, interaction designs, user study designs, and assessment methods. Our analysis of system interaction design reveals a predominant focus on supporting individual ideation activities and text-based interaction, with a growing trend of incorporating multimedia elements. However, in group ideation, tools and interaction modalities targeting both synchronous and asynchronous collaboration are much scarcer. We synthesize the primary findings of our review and outline promising directions for future research in LLM-assisted ideation. We hope this review will help researchers quickly gain an overview of this rapidly expanding area, efficiently locate relevant work, and identify underexplored areas for further investigation. In addition, we believe the framework we present here will form the basis for the development of future problem and solution space taxonomies, and methodologies for LLM-assisted ideation development and use.</p></details> |  |

However, current studies rely on limited evidence and offer less control over final outputs. To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Framework to generate counterspeech against health misinformation, incorporating multiple LLMs to optimize knowledge retrieval, evidence enhancement, and response refinement. Our approach integrates both static and dynamic evidence, ensuring that the generated counterspeech is relevant, well-grounded, and up-to-date. Our method outperforms baseline approaches in politeness, relevance, informativeness, and factual accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating high-quality counterspeech. To further validate our approach, we conduct ablation studies to verify the necessity of each component in our framework. Furthermore, cross evaluations show that our system generalizes well across diverse health misinformation topics and datasets. And human evaluations reveal that refinement significantly enhances counterspeech quality and obtains human preference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at COLM 2025</p></details> |

However, the complex and dynamic nature of underwater environments, characterized by limited visibility, unpredictable currents, and communication constraints, presents significant challenges that demand advanced autonomy while ensuring operator trust and oversight. Central to addressing these challenges are knowledge representation and reasoning techniques, particularly knowledge graphs and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, that enable robots to efficiently structure, retrieve, and interpret complex environmental data. These capabilities empower robotic agents to reason, adapt, and respond effectively to changing conditions. The primary goal of this work is to demonstrate both multi-agent autonomy and shared autonomy, where multiple robotic agents operate independently while remaining connected to a human supervisor. We show how a RAG-powered large language model, augmented with knowledge graph data and domain taxonomy, enables autonomous multi-agent decision-making and facilitates seamless human-robot interaction, resulting in 100\% mission validation and behavior completeness. Finally, ablation studies reveal that without structured knowledge from the graph and/or taxonomy, the LLM is prone to hallucinations, which can compromise decision quality.</p></details> |  |

Current moderation tools primarily rely on keyword filtering or binary classifiers, limiting their ability to detect nuanced harm effectively. Aims: This study introduces a fine-grained, multi-class classification framework that leverages instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify twelve distinct categories of sexist and misogynistic comments on GitHub. Method: We utilized an instruction-tuned LLM-based framework with systematic prompt refinement across 20 iterations, evaluated on 1,440 labeled GitHub comments across twelve sexism/misogyny categories. Model performances were rigorously compared using precision, recall, F1-score, and the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). Results: Our optimized approach (GPT-4o with Prompt 19) achieved an MCC of 0.501, significantly outperforming baseline approaches. While this model had low false positives, it struggled to interpret nuanced, context-dependent sexism and misogyny reliably. Conclusion: Well-designed prompts with clear definitions and structured outputs significantly improve the accuracy and interpretability of sexism detection, enabling precise and practical moderation on developer platforms like GitHub.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 1...</summary><p>The 19th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement</p></details> |

Evaluating these capabilities is becoming crucial yet remains challenging. Existing benchmarks mostly adopt a \textbf{character-centric} approach, simplify user-character interactions to isolated Q&A tasks, and fail to reflect real-world applications. To address this limitation, we introduce RMTBench, a comprehensive \textbf{user-centric} bilingual role-playing benchmark featuring 80 diverse characters and over 8,000 dialogue rounds. RMTBench includes custom characters with detailed backgrounds and abstract characters defined by simple traits, enabling evaluation across various user scenarios. Our benchmark constructs dialogues based on explicit user motivations rather than character descriptions, ensuring alignment with practical user applications. Furthermore, we construct an authentic multi-turn dialogue simulation mechanism. With carefully selected evaluation dimensions and LLM-based scoring, this mechanism captures the complex intention of conversations between the user and the character. By shifting focus from character background to user intention fulfillment, RMTBench bridges the gap between academic evaluation and practical deployment requirements, offering a more effective framework for assessing role-playing capabilities in LLMs. All code and datasets will be released soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous User Modeling for LLM-based Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04626v2)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for recommendation has demonstrated notable success in various domains, showcasing their potential for open-domain recommendation. A key challenge to advancing open-domain recommendation lies in effectively modeling user preferences from users' heterogeneous behaviors across multiple domains. Existing approaches, including ID-based and semantic-based modeling, struggle with poor generalization, an inability to compress noisy interactions effectively, and the domain seesaw phenomenon. To address these challenges, we propose a Heterogeneous User Modeling (HUM) method, which incorporates a compression enhancer and a robustness enhancer for LLM-based recommendation. The compression enhancer uses a customized prompt to compress heterogeneous behaviors into a tailored token, while a masking mechanism enhances cross-domain knowledge extraction and understanding. The robustness enhancer introduces a domain importance score to mitigate the domain seesaw phenomenon by guiding domain optimization. Extensive experiments on heterogeneous datasets validate that HUM effectively models user heterogeneity by achieving both high efficacy and robustness, leading to superior performance in open-domain recommendation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by RecSys 2025</p></details> |

The challenge aims to address a critical limitation of modern Vision Language Models (VLMs): their propensity to hallucinate, especially when faced with egocentric imagery, long-tail entities, and complex, multi-hop questions. This issue is particularly problematic in real-world applications where users pose fact-seeking queries that demand high factual accuracy across diverse modalities. To tackle this, we propose a robust, multi-stage framework that prioritizes factual accuracy and truthfulness over completeness. Our solution integrates a lightweight query router for efficiency, a query-aware retrieval and summarization pipeline, a dual-pathways generation and a post-hoc verification. This conservative strategy is designed to minimize hallucinations, which incur a severe penalty in the competition's scoring metric. Our approach achieved 3rd place in Task 1, demonstrating the effectiveness of prioritizing answer reliability in complex multi-modal RAG systems. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/Breezelled/KDD-Cup-2025-Meta-CRAG-MM .</p></details> | <details><summary>KDD C...</summary><p>KDD Cup 2025 Meta CRAG-MM Challenge</p></details> |

While RAG demonstrates strong performance on benchmarks largely derived from general-domain corpora like Wikipedia, its effectiveness under realistic, diverse retrieval scenarios remains underexplored. We evaluated RAG systems using MassiveDS, a large-scale datastore with mixture of knowledge, and identified critical limitations: retrieval mainly benefits smaller models, rerankers add minimal value, and no single retrieval source consistently excels. Moreover, current LLMs struggle to route queries across heterogeneous knowledge sources. These findings highlight the need for adaptive retrieval strategies before deploying RAG in real-world settings.

However, these systems are vulnerable to adversarial poisoning attacks, where malicious passages injected into the retrieval corpus can mislead models into producing factually incorrect outputs. In this paper, we present a rigorously controlled empirical study of how RAG systems behave under such attacks and how their robustness can be improved. On the generation side, we introduce a structured taxonomy of context types-adversarial, untouched, and guiding-and systematically analyze their individual and combined effects on model outputs. On the retrieval side, we evaluate several retrievers to measure how easily they expose LLMs to adversarial contexts. Our findings also reveal that "skeptical prompting" can activate LLMs' internal reasoning, enabling partial self-defense against adversarial passages, though its effectiveness depends strongly on the model's reasoning capacity. Together, our experiments (code available at https://github.com/JinyanSu1/eval_PoisonRaG) and analysis provide actionable insights for designing safer and more resilient RAG systems, paving the way for more reliable real-world deployments.</p></details> |  |

Existing fusion approaches typically rely on either instance-based proposals or dense BEV grids, which either lack holistic scene understanding or are limited by rigid grid structures. To address these, we propose RaGS, the first framework to leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) as representation for fusing 4D radar and monocular cues in 3D object detection. 3D GS naturally suits 3D object detection by modeling the scene as a field of Gaussians, dynamically allocating resources on foreground objects and providing a flexible, resource-efficient solution. RaGS uses a cascaded pipeline to construct and refine the Gaussian field. It starts with the Frustum-based Localization Initiation (FLI), which unprojects foreground pixels to initialize coarse 3D Gaussians positions. Then, the Iterative Multimodal Aggregation (IMA) fuses semantics and geometry, refining the limited Gaussians to the regions of interest. Finally, the Multi-level Gaussian Fusion (MGF) renders the Gaussians into multi-level BEV features for 3D object detection. By dynamically focusing on sparse objects within scenes, RaGS enable object concentrating while offering comprehensive scene perception. Extensive experiments on View-of-Delft, TJ4DRadSet, and OmniHD-Scenes benchmarks demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance. Code will be released.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, conference</p></details> |

This paper presents a comprehensive systematic review of RAG, tracing its evolution from early developments in open domain question answering to recent state-of-the-art implementations across diverse applications. The review begins by outlining the motivations behind RAG, particularly its ability to mitigate hallucinations and outdated knowledge in parametric models. Core technical components-retrieval mechanisms, sequence-to-sequence generation models, and fusion strategies are examined in detail. A year-by-year analysis highlights key milestones and research trends, providing insight into RAG's rapid growth. The paper further explores the deployment of RAG in enterprise systems, addressing practical challenges related to retrieval of proprietary data, security, and scalability. A comparative evaluation of RAG implementations is conducted, benchmarking performance on retrieval accuracy, generation fluency, latency, and computational efficiency. Persistent challenges such as retrieval quality, privacy concerns, and integration overhead are critically assessed. Finally, the review highlights emerging solutions, including hybrid retrieval approaches, privacy-preserving techniques, optimized fusion strategies, and agentic RAG architectures. These innovations point toward a future of more reliable, efficient, and context-aware knowledge-intensive NLP systems.</p></details> | 33 pages, 2 figures |

We propose an efficient fine-tuning framework, called PrismRAG, that (i) trains the model with distractor-aware QA pairs mixing gold evidence with subtle distractor passages, and (ii) instills reasoning-centric habits that make the LLM plan, rationalize, and synthesize without relying on extensive human engineered instructions.

However, this reliance on external sources exposes a security risk, attackers can inject poisoned documents into the knowledge base to steer the generation process toward harmful or misleading outputs. In this paper, we propose Gradient-based Masked Token Probability (GMTP), a novel defense method to detect and filter out adversarially crafted documents. Specifically, GMTP identifies high-impact tokens by examining gradients of the retriever's similarity function. These key tokens are then masked, and their probabilities are checked via a Masked Language Model (MLM). Since injected tokens typically exhibit markedly low masked-token probabilities, this enables GMTP to easily detect malicious documents and achieve high-precision filtering. Experiments demonstrate that GMTP is able to eliminate over 90% of poisoned content while retaining relevant documents, thus maintaining robust retrieval and generation performance across diverse datasets and adversarial settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, accepted to ACL Findings 2025</p></details> |

Our qualitative evaluation using use-case scenarios yields promising results, correctly predicting risk levels while retrieving relevant articles across three distinct semantic groups. Furthermore, interpretation of results shows that the tool's reasoning relies on comparison with the setting of high-risk systems, a behaviour attributed to their deployment requiring careful consideration, and therefore frequently presented within the AI Act.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 1 figure, 4 tables</p></details> |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), serving as an inference-time scaling method, is notable for its low cost and minimal effort for parameter tuning. However, due to heterogeneous training data and model architecture, the variant embedding models used in RAG exhibit different benefits across various areas, often leading to different similarity calculation results and, consequently, varying response quality from LLMs. To address this problem, we propose and examine two approaches to enhance RAG by combining the benefits of multiple embedding models, named Mixture-Embedding RAG and Confident RAG. Mixture-Embedding RAG simply sorts and selects retrievals from multiple embedding models based on standardized similarity; however, it does not outperform vanilla RAG. In contrast, Confident RAG generates responses multiple times using different embedding models and then selects the responses with the highest confidence level, demonstrating average improvements of approximately 10% and 5% over vanilla LLMs and RAG, respectively. The consistent results across different LLMs and embedding models indicate that Confident RAG is an efficient plug-and-play approach for various domains. We will release our code upon publication.</p></details> |  |

However, discrepancies between these textbooks and the parametric knowledge inherent in Large Language Models (LLMs) can undermine the effectiveness of RAG systems. To systematically investigate RAG system robustness against such knowledge discrepancies, we introduce KnowShiftQA. This novel question answering dataset simulates these discrepancies by applying deliberate hypothetical knowledge updates to both answers and source documents, reflecting how textbook knowledge can shift. KnowShiftQA comprises 3,005 questions across five subjects, designed with a comprehensive question typology focusing on context utilization and knowledge integration. Our extensive experiments on retrieval and question answering performance reveal that most RAG systems suffer a substantial performance drop when faced with these knowledge discrepancies. Furthermore, questions requiring the integration of contextual (textbook) knowledge with parametric (LLM) knowledge pose a significant challenge to current LLMs.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Main |

Yet, a pressing challenge remains: How can we trust these agents especially in zero-shot settings with no fine-tuning? We introduce a novel modular Agentic AI visual classification framework that integrates generalist multimodal agents with a non-visual reasoning orchestrator and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module. Applied to apple leaf disease diagnosis, we benchmark three configurations: (I) zero-shot with confidence-based orchestration, (II) fine-tuned agents with improved performance, and (III) trust-calibrated orchestration enhanced by CLIP-based image retrieval and re-evaluation loops. Using confidence calibration metrics (ECE, OCR, CCC), the orchestrator modulates trust across agents. Our results demonstrate a 77.94\% accuracy improvement in the zero-shot setting using trust-aware orchestration and RAG, achieving 85.63\% overall. GPT-4o showed better calibration, while Qwen-2.5-VL displayed overconfidence. Furthermore, image-RAG grounded predictions with visually similar cases, enabling correction of agent overconfidence via iterative re-evaluation. The proposed system separates perception (vision agents) from meta-reasoning (orchestrator), enabling scalable and interpretable multi-agent AI. This blueprint is extensible to diagnostics, biology, and other trust-critical domains. All models, prompts, results, and system components including the complete software source code are openly released to support reproducibility, transparency, and community benchmarking at Github: https://github.com/Applied-AI-Research-Lab/Orchestrator-Agent-Trust</p></details> |  |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising conversational interfaces, their inherent limitations, including reliance on black-box training data, susceptibility to hallucinations, and lack of domain-specific knowledge, hinder their reliability in specialized fields like pharmacovigilance. To address this gap, we propose two architectures: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG, which integrate comprehensive drug side effect knowledge into a Llama 3 8B language model. Through extensive evaluations on 19,520 drug side effect associations (covering 976 drugs and 3,851 side effect terms), our results demonstrate that GraphRAG achieves near-perfect accuracy in drug side effect retrieval. This framework offers a highly accurate and scalable solution, signifying a significant advancement in leveraging LLMs for critical pharmacovigilance applications.</p></details> |  |

However, current automated RAG metrics perform poorly in clinical and conversational use cases. Using clinical human evaluations of responses is expensive, unscalable, and not conducive to the continuous iterative development of RAG systems. To address these challenges, we introduce ASTRID - an Automated and Scalable TRIaD for evaluating clinical QA systems leveraging RAG - consisting of three metrics: Context Relevance (CR), Refusal Accuracy (RA), and Conversational Faithfulness (CF). Our novel evaluation metric, CF, is designed to better capture the faithfulness of a model's response to the knowledge base without penalising conversational elements. To validate our triad, we curate a dataset of over 200 real-world patient questions posed to an LLM-based QA agent during surgical follow-up for cataract surgery - the highest volume operation in the world - augmented with clinician-selected questions for emergency, clinical, and non-clinical out-of-domain scenarios. We demonstrate that CF can predict human ratings of faithfulness better than existing definitions for conversational use cases. Furthermore, we show that evaluation using our triad consisting of CF, RA, and CR exhibits alignment with clinician assessment for inappropriate, harmful, or unhelpful responses. Finally, using nine different LLMs, we demonstrate that the three metrics can closely agree with human evaluations, highlighting the potential of these metrics for use in LLM-driven automated evaluation pipelines. We also publish the prompts and datasets for these experiments, providing valuable resources for further research and development.</p></details> | 29 pages |
| **[Secure Multifaceted-RAG for Enterprise: Hybrid Knowledge Retrieval with Security Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13425v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems face challenges in enterprise settings due to limited retrieval scope and data security risks. When relevant internal documents are unavailable, the system struggles to generate accurate and complete responses. Additionally, using closed-source Large Language Models (LLMs) raises concerns about exposing proprietary information. To address these issues, we propose the Secure Multifaceted-RAG (SecMulti-RAG) framework, which retrieves not only from internal documents but also from two supplementary sources: pre-generated expert knowledge for anticipated queries and on-demand external LLM-generated knowledge. To mitigate security risks, we adopt a local open-source generator and selectively utilize external LLMs only when prompts are deemed safe by a filtering mechanism. This approach enhances completeness, prevents data leakage, and reduces costs. In our evaluation on a report generation task in the automotive industry, SecMulti-RAG significantly outperforms traditional RAG - achieving 79.3 to 91.9 percent win rates across correctness, richness, and helpfulness in LLM-based evaluation, and 56.3 to 70.4 percent in human evaluation. This highlights SecMulti-RAG as a practical and secure solution for enterprise RAG.</p></details> |  |

However, when building real-world RAG applications, practical issues arise. First, the retrieved information is generally domain-specific. Since it is computationally expensive to fine-tune LLMs, it is more feasible to fine-tune the retriever to improve the quality of the data included in the LLM input. Second, as more applications are deployed in the same real-world system, one cannot afford to deploy separate retrievers. Moreover, these RAG applications normally retrieve different kinds of data. Our solution is to instruction fine-tune a small retriever encoder on a variety of domain-specific tasks to allow us to deploy one encoder that can serve many use cases, thereby achieving low-cost, scalability, and speed. We show how this encoder generalizes to out-of-domain settings as well as to an unseen retrieval task on real-world enterprise use cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures.

This survey synthesizes both strands under a unified reasoning-retrieval perspective. We first map how advanced reasoning optimizes each stage of RAG (Reasoning-Enhanced RAG). Then, we show how retrieved knowledge of different type supply missing premises and expand context for complex inference (RAG-Enhanced Reasoning). Finally, we spotlight emerging Synergized RAG-Reasoning frameworks, where (agentic) LLMs iteratively interleave search and reasoning to achieve state-of-the-art performance across knowledge-intensive benchmarks. We categorize methods, datasets, and open challenges, and outline research avenues toward deeper RAG-Reasoning systems that are more effective, multimodally-adaptive, trustworthy, and human-centric.

Improper retrieval settings can degrade performance, making RAG less reliable than closed-book generation. In this work, we introduce RAGGED, a framework for systematically evaluating RAG systems across diverse retriever-reader configurations, retrieval depths, and datasets. Our analysis reveals that reader robustness to noise is the key determinant of RAG stability and scalability. Some readers benefit from increased retrieval depth, while others degrade due to their sensitivity to distracting content. Through large-scale experiments on open-domain, multi-hop, and specialized-domain datasets, we show that retrievers, rerankers, and prompts influence performance but do not fundamentally alter these reader-driven trends. By providing a principled framework and new metrics to assess RAG stability and scalability, RAGGED enables systematic evaluation of retrieval-augmented generation systems, guiding future research on optimizing retrieval depth and model robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/neulab/ragged</p></details> |

Prior work either reduces the response delay (through better scheduling of RAG queries) or strives to maximize quality (which involves tuning the RAG workflow), but they fall short in optimizing the tradeoff between the delay and quality of RAG responses. This paper presents METIS, the first RAG system that jointly schedules queries and adapts the key RAG configurations of each query, such as the number of retrieved text chunks and synthesis methods, in order to balance quality optimization and response delay reduction. Using 4 popular RAG-QA datasets, we show that compared with the state-of-the-art RAG optimization schemes, METIS reduces the generation latency by $1.64-2.54\times$ without sacrificing generation quality.</p></details> | 17 pages, 18 figures |

While large language models (LLMs) offer potential for automating advisory tasks, most existing solutions remain limited to prototypes or synthetic benchmarks. MARAUS addresses this gap by combining hybrid retrieval, multi-agent orchestration, and LLM-based generation into a system tailored for real-world university admissions. In collaboration with the University of Transport Technology (UTT) in Hanoi, we conducted a two-phase study involving technical development and real-world evaluation. MARAUS processed over 6,000 actual user interactions, spanning six categories of queries. Results show substantial improvements over LLM-only baselines: on average 92 percent accuracy, hallucination rates reduced from 15 precent to 1.45 percent, and average response times below 4 seconds. The system operated cost-effectively, with a two-week deployment cost of 11.58 USD using GPT-4o mini. This work provides actionable insights for the deployment of agentic RAG systems in low-resource educational settings.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods have explored enhancing models' search and reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL). Although these methods demonstrate promising results, they face challenges in training stability and encounter issues such as substantial inference time and restricted capabilities due to the single-query mode. In this paper, we propose RAG-R1, a novel training framework designed to enable LLMs to adaptively leverage internal and external knowledge during the reasoning process. We further expand the generation and retrieval processes within the framework from single-query mode to multi-query parallelism, aimed at reducing inference time and enhancing the model's capabilities. Extensive experiments on seven question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the strongest baseline by up to 13.2% and decreases inference time by 11.1%.</p></details> |  |
| **[DRAGON: Dynamic RAG Benchmark On News](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05713v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a widely adopted approach for improving the factuality of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge at inference time. Although there exist multiple RAG benchmarks for English, evaluation resources for other languages, including Russian, remain scarce and static, failing to capture the dynamic nature of real-world deployments. In this work, we present DRAGON (Dynamic RAG Benchmark On News), the first dynamic benchmark for evaluating RAG systems in Russian on a changing news corpora. DRAGON is built upon a regularly updated corpus of Russian news and public documents and supports comprehensive evaluation of both the retriever and generator components. Question generation is performed automatically with the use of Knowledge Graph constructed from the corpus and enables the extraction of four core question types aligned with distinct subgraph patterns. We release a complete evaluation framework comprising the pipeline for automatic question generation, evaluation scripts, which are potentially reusable for other languages and multilingual settings, and benchmark data. We also launch a public leaderboard to encourage community participation and comparison.</p></details> |  |

What Can Predicted Query Performance Tell Us about the Search Behaviour of Agentic RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10411v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a new paradigm where the reasoning model decides when to invoke a retriever (as a "tool") when answering a question. This paradigm, exemplified by recent research works such as Search-R1, enables the model to decide when to search and obtain external information. However, the queries generated by such Agentic RAG models and the role of the retriever in obtaining high-quality answers remain understudied. To this end, this initial study examines the applicability of query performance prediction (QPP) within the recent Agentic RAG models Search-R1 and R1-Searcher. We find that applying effective retrievers can achieve higher answer quality within a shorter reasoning process. Moreover, the QPP estimates of the generated queries, used as an approximation of their retrieval quality, are positively correlated with the quality of the final answer. Ultimately, our work is a step towards adaptive retrieval within Agentic RAG, where QPP is used to inform the model if the retrieved results are likely to be useful.</p></details> |  |

While classical machine learning models leverage structured socio-demographic and behavioral data, they often fail to capture the nuanced emotional and contextual factors embedded in unstructured student interactions. This paper introduces a transformative AI framework that redefines dropout prediction through three synergistic innovations: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for domain-specific sentiment analysis, prompt engineering to decode academic stressors,and cross-modal attention fusion to dynamically align textual, behavioral, and socio-demographic insights. By grounding sentiment analysis in a curated knowledge base of pedagogical content, our RAG-enhanced BERT model interprets student comments with unprecedented contextual relevance, while optimized prompts isolate indicators of academic distress (e.g., "isolation," "workload anxiety"). A cross-modal attention layer then fuses these insights with temporal engagement patterns, creating holistic risk pro-files. Evaluated on a longitudinal dataset of 4 423 students, the framework achieves 89% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.88, outperforming conventional models by 7% and reducing false negatives by 21%. Beyond prediction, the system generates interpretable interventions by retrieving contextually aligned strategies (e.g., mentorship programs for isolated learners). This work bridges the gap between predictive analytics and actionable pedagogy, offering a scalable solution to mitigate dropout risks in global education systems</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, 1 Algorithms, 17th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies,: 30 June-2 July, 2025 Location: Palma, Spain</p></details> |

We present a novel multimodal document chunking approach that leverages Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to process PDF documents in batches while maintaining semantic coherence and structural integrity. Our method processes documents in configurable page batches with cross-batch context preservation, enabling accurate handling of tables spanning multiple pages, embedded visual elements, and procedural content. We evaluate our approach on a curated dataset of PDF documents with manually crafted queries, demonstrating improvements in chunk quality and downstream RAG performance. Our vision-guided approach achieves better accuracy compared to traditional vanilla RAG systems, with qualitative analysis showing superior preservation of document structure and semantic coherence.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 1 Figure, 1 Table</p></details> |

However, their effectiveness remains constrained when reasoning extends beyond the knowledge acquired during pretraining. Conventional approaches, such as fine-tuning or retrieval-augmented generation, face limitations in either imposing high computational overhead or failing to fully exploit structured scientific data. To overcome these challenges, we propose DrugMCTS, a novel framework that synergistically integrates RAG, multi-agent collaboration, and Monte Carlo Tree Search for drug repurposing. The framework employs five specialized agents tasked with retrieving and analyzing molecular and protein information, thereby enabling structured and iterative reasoning. Without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning, DrugMCTS empowers Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct to outperform Deepseek-R1 by over 20\%. Extensive experiments on the DrugBank and KIBA datasets demonstrate that DrugMCTS achieves substantially higher recall and robustness compared to both general-purpose LLMs and deep learning baselines. Our results highlight the importance of structured reasoning, agent-based collaboration, and feedback-driven search mechanisms in advancing LLM applications for drug discovery.</p></details> |  |

We present HedraRAG, a runtime system built on a graph-based abstraction that exposes optimization opportunities across stage-level parallelism, intra-request similarity, and inter-request skewness. These opportunities are realized through dynamic graph transformations, such as node splitting, reordering, edge addition, and dependency rewiring, applied to wavefronts of subgraphs spanning concurrent requests. The resulting execution plans are mapped onto hybrid CPU-GPU pipelines to improve resource utilization and reduce latency.

However, its adoption is hindered by the complexity of policy languages and the risk of misconfigurations. In this work, we present ARPaCCino, an agentic system that combines Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG), and tool-based validation to automate the generation and verification of PaC rules. Given natural language descriptions of the desired policies, ARPaCCino generates formal Rego rules, assesses IaC compliance, and iteratively refines the IaC configurations to ensure conformance. Thanks to its modular agentic architecture and integration with external tools and knowledge bases, ARPaCCino supports policy validation across a wide range of technologies, including niche or emerging IaC frameworks. Experimental evaluation involving a Terraform-based case study demonstrates ARPaCCino's effectiveness in generating syntactically and semantically correct policies, identifying non-compliant infrastructures, and applying corrective modifications, even when using smaller, open-weight LLMs. Our results highlight the potential of agentic RAG architectures to enhance the automation, reliability, and accessibility of PaC workflows.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by incorporating external information, often from graph-structured data. However, existing graph-based RAG methods suffer from poor graph quality due to incomplete extraction and insufficient utilization of query information during retrieval. To overcome these limitations, we propose CUE-RAG, a novel approach that introduces (1) a multi-partite graph index incorporates text Chunks, knowledge Units, and Entities to capture semantic content at multiple levels of granularity, (2) a hybrid extraction strategy that reduces LLM token usage while still producing accurate and disambiguated knowledge units, and (3) Q-Iter, a query-driven iterative retrieval strategy that enhances relevance through semantic search and constrained graph traversal. Experiments on three QA benchmarks show that CUE-RAG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 99.33% higher Accuracy and 113.51% higher F1 score while reducing indexing costs by 72.58%. Remarkably, CUE-RAG matches or outperforms baselines even without using an LLM for indexing. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of CUE-RAG in advancing graph-based RAG systems.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances factual accuracy by integrating external sources, but it presents two key challenges. First, insufficient retrieval can miss critical information, whereas excessive retrieval can introduce irrelevant or misleading content, disrupting model output. Second, even when the model initially provides correct answers, over-reliance on retrieved data can lead to factual errors. To address these issues, we introduce the Multimodal Intelligent Retrieval and Augmentation (MIRA) framework, designed to optimize factual accuracy in MLLM. MIRA consists of two key components: (1) a calibrated Rethinking and Rearrangement module that dynamically adjusts the number of retrieved contexts to manage factual risk, and (2) A medical RAG framework integrating image embeddings and a medical knowledge base with a query-rewrite module for efficient multimodal reasoning. This enables the model to effectively integrate both its inherent knowledge and external references. Our evaluation of publicly available medical VQA and report generation benchmarks demonstrates that MIRA substantially enhances factual accuracy and overall performance, achieving new state-of-the-art results.

| **[KeyKnowledgeRAG (K^2RAG): An Enhanced RAG method for improved LLM question-answering capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07695v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning is an immensely resource-intensive process when retraining Large Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate a larger body of knowledge. Although many fine-tuning techniques have been developed to reduce the time and computational cost involved, the challenge persists as LLMs continue to grow in size and complexity. To address this, a new approach to knowledge expansion in LLMs is needed. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers one such alternative by storing external knowledge in a database and retrieving relevant chunks to support question answering. However, naive implementations of RAG face significant limitations in scalability and answer accuracy. This paper introduces KeyKnowledgeRAG (K2RAG), a novel framework designed to overcome these limitations. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer paradigm, K2RAG integrates dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text summarization to improve retrieval quality and system efficiency. The framework also includes a preprocessing step that summarizes the training data, significantly reducing the training time. K2RAG was evaluated using the MultiHopRAG dataset, where the proposed pipeline was trained on the document corpus and tested on a separate evaluation set. Results demonstrated notable improvements over common naive RAG implementations. K2RAG achieved the highest mean answer similarity score of 0.57, and reached the highest third quartile (Q3) similarity of 0.82, indicating better alignment with ground-truth answers. In addition to improved accuracy, the framework proved highly efficient. The summarization step reduced the average training time of individual components by 93%, and execution speed was up to 40% faster than traditional knowledge graph-based RAG systems. K2RAG also demonstrated superior scalability, requiring three times less VRAM than several naive RAG implementations tested in this study.</p></details> | 21 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Multi-Head RAG: Solving Multi-Aspect Problems with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05085v4)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling the retrieval of documents into the LLM context to provide more accurate and relevant responses. Existing RAG solutions do not focus on queries that may require fetching multiple documents with substantially different contents. Such queries occur frequently, but are challenging because the embeddings of these documents may be distant in the embedding space, making it hard to retrieve them all. This paper introduces Multi-Head RAG (MRAG), a novel scheme designed to address this gap with a simple yet powerful idea: leveraging activations of Transformer's multi-head attention layer, instead of the decoder layer, as keys for fetching multi-aspect documents. The driving observation is that different attention heads learn to capture different data aspects. Harnessing the corresponding activations results in embeddings that represent various facets of data items and queries, improving the retrieval accuracy for complex queries. We provide an evaluation methodology and metrics, multi-aspect datasets, and real-world use cases to demonstrate MRAG's effectiveness. We show MRAG's design advantages over 18 RAG baselines, empirical improvements of up to 20% in retrieval success ratios, and benefits for downstream LLM generation. MRAG can be seamlessly integrated with existing RAG frameworks and benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Cross-Lingual Cost: Retrieval Biases in RAG over Arabic-English Corpora](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07543v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-lingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a critical capability for retrieving and generating answers across languages. Prior work in this context has mostly focused on generation and relied on benchmarks derived from open-domain sources, most notably Wikipedia. In such settings, retrieval challenges often remain hidden due to language imbalances, overlap with pretraining data, and memorized content. To address this gap, we study Arabic-English RAG in a domain-specific setting using benchmarks derived from real-world corporate datasets. Our benchmarks include all combinations of languages for the user query and the supporting document, drawn independently and uniformly at random. This enables a systematic study of multilingual retrieval behavior. Our findings reveal that retrieval is a critical bottleneck in cross-lingual domain-specific scenarios, with significant performance drops occurring when the user query and supporting document languages differ. A key insight is that these failures stem primarily from the retriever's difficulty in ranking documents across languages. Finally, we propose a simple retrieval strategy that addresses this source of failure by enforcing equal retrieval from both languages, resulting in substantial improvements in cross-lingual and overall performance. These results highlight meaningful opportunities for improving multilingual retrieval, particularly in practical, real-world RAG applications.</p></details> |  |

Benefiting from the strong ability in facilitating diverse data sources and supporting faithful reasoning, knowledge graphs (KGs) have been increasingly adopted in RAG systems, giving rise to KG-based RAG (KG-RAG) methods. Though RAG systems are widely applied in various applications, recent studies have also revealed its vulnerabilities to data poisoning attacks, where malicious information injected into external knowledge sources can mislead the system into producing incorrect or harmful responses. However, these studies focus exclusively on RAG systems using unstructured textual data sources, leaving the security risks of KG-RAG largely unexplored, despite the fact that KGs present unique vulnerabilities due to their structured and editable nature. In this work, we conduct the first systematic investigation of the security issue of KG-RAG methods through data poisoning attacks. To this end, we introduce a practical, stealthy attack setting that aligns with real-world implementation. We propose an attack strategy that first identifies adversarial target answers and then inserts perturbation triples to complete misleading inference chains in the KG, increasing the likelihood that KG-RAG methods retrieve and rely on these perturbations during generation. Through extensive experiments on two benchmarks and four recent KG-RAG methods, our attack strategy demonstrates strong effectiveness in degrading KG-RAG performance, even with minimal KG perturbations. In-depth analyses are also conducted to understand the safety threats within the internal stages of KG-RAG systems and to explore the robustness of LLMs against adversarial knowledge.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

Retrievers encompass a multitude of hyperparameters that significantly impact performance outcomes and demonstrate sensitivity to specific applications. Nevertheless, hyperparameter optimization entails prohibitively high computational expenses. Existing evaluation methods suffer from either prohibitive costs or disconnection from domain-specific scenarios. This paper proposes SEARA (Subset sampling Evaluation for Automatic Retriever Assessment), which addresses evaluation data challenges through subset sampling techniques and achieves robust automated retriever evaluation by minimal retrieval facts extraction and comprehensive retrieval metrics. Based on real user queries, this method enables fully automated retriever evaluation at low cost, thereby obtaining optimal retriever for specific business scenarios. We validate our method across classic RAG applications in rednote, including knowledge-based Q&A system and retrieval-based travel assistant, successfully obtaining scenario-specific optimal retrievers.</p></details> |  |

Currently, text visualizations are confined either to _flat, line-based_ decorations, which can convey only limited information about textual structure, or _nested boxes_, which convey structure but often destroy the typographic layout of the underlying text. We hypothesize that the lack of rich styling options limits the kinds of information that are displayed alongside text, wherever it may be displayed. In this paper, we show that it is possible to achieve arbitrarily nested decorations while minimally disturbing the underlying typographic layout. Specifically, we present a layout algorithm that generates _ragged blocks_, or _rocks_, which are rectilinear polygons that allow nested text to be compactly rendered even when styled with borders and padding. We evaluate our layout algorithm in two ways. First, on a benchmark suite comprising representative source code files in multiple programming languages, we show that the (ragged block) layouts produced by our algorithm are substantially more compact than the (rectangular block) layouts produced by conventional techniques, when uniformly styling every element in the syntax tree with borders and padding. Second, through a small gallery of usage scenarios, we demonstrate how future code editors, word processors, and other document-rendering GUIs might convey rich semantic information through domain-specific styling of ragged blocks.</p></details> |  |

This work addresses the Closed Visual Question Answering (CVQA) task, where the goal is to select the correct answer to multiple-choice clinical questions based on both user-submitted images and accompanying symptom descriptions. The proposed approach combines three core components: (1) fine-tuning open-source multimodal models from the Qwen, Gemma, and LLaMA families on the competition dataset, (2) introducing a structured reasoning layer that reconciles and adjudicates between candidate model outputs, and (3) incorporating agentic retrieval-augmented generation (agentic RAG), which adds relevant information from the American Academy of Dermatology's symptom and condition database to fill in gaps in patient context. The team achieved second place with a submission that scored sixth, demonstrating competitive performance and high accuracy. Beyond competitive benchmarks, this research addresses a practical challenge in telemedicine: diagnostic decisions must often be made asynchronously, with limited input and with high accuracy and interpretability. By emulating the systematic reasoning patterns employed by dermatologists when evaluating skin conditions, this architecture provided a pathway toward more reliable automated diagnostic support systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 ImageCLEF MEDIQA-MAGIC Challenge</p></details> |

However, RAG's reliance on ingesting external documents introduces new vulnerabilities. This paper exposes a critical security gap at the data loading stage, where malicious actors can stealthily corrupt RAG pipelines by exploiting document ingestion. We propose a taxonomy of 9 knowledge-based poisoning attacks and introduce two novel threat vectors -- Content Obfuscation and Content Injection -- targeting common formats (DOCX, HTML, PDF). Using an automated toolkit implementing 19 stealthy injection techniques, we test five popular data loaders, finding a 74.4% attack success rate across 357 scenarios. We further validate these threats on six end-to-end RAG systems -- including white-box pipelines and black-box services like NotebookLM and OpenAI Assistants -- demonstrating high success rates and critical vulnerabilities that bypass filters and silently compromise output integrity. Our results emphasize the urgent need to secure the document ingestion process in RAG systems against covert content manipulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>curre...</summary><p>currently under submission</p></details> |

In this paper, we explore and assess the feasibility of using traditional binary string features for MFC in the new era of large language models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Specifically, we investigate how Family-Specific String (FSS) features could be utilized in a manner similar to RAG to facilitate MFC. To this end, we develop a curated evaluation framework covering 4,347 samples from 67 malware families, extract and analyze over 25 million strings, and conduct detailed ablation studies to assess the impact of different design choices in four major modules.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Query to Explanation: Uni-RAG for Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Learning in STEM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03868v1)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In AI-facilitated teaching, leveraging various query styles to interpret abstract educational content is crucial for delivering effective and accessible learning experiences. However, existing retrieval systems predominantly focus on natural text-image matching and lack the capacity to address the diversity and ambiguity inherent in real-world educational scenarios. To address this limitation, we develop a lightweight and efficient multi-modal retrieval module, named Uni-Retrieval, which extracts query-style prototypes and dynamically matches them with tokens from a continually updated Prompt Bank. This Prompt Bank encodes and stores domain-specific knowledge by leveraging a Mixture-of-Expert Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE-LoRA) module and can be adapted to enhance Uni-Retrieval's capability to accommodate unseen query types at test time. To enable natural language educational content generation, we integrate the original Uni-Retrieval with a compact instruction-tuned language model, forming a complete retrieval-augmented generation pipeline named Uni-RAG. Given a style-conditioned query, Uni-RAG first retrieves relevant educational materials and then generates human-readable explanations, feedback, or instructional content aligned with the learning objective. Experimental results on SER and other multi-modal benchmarks show that Uni-RAG outperforms baseline retrieval and RAG systems in both retrieval accuracy and generation quality, while maintaining low computational cost. Our framework provides a scalable, pedagogically grounded solution for intelligent educational systems, bridging retrieval and generation to support personalized, explainable, and efficient learning assistance across diverse STEM scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Fair RAG: On the Impact of Fair Ranking in Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11598v4)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the central role of retrieval in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, much of the existing research on RAG overlooks the well-established field of fair ranking and fails to account for the interests of all stakeholders involved. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic evaluation of RAG systems that integrate fairness-aware rankings, addressing both ranking fairness and attribution fairness, which ensures equitable exposure of the sources cited in the generated content. Our evaluation focuses on measuring item-side fairness, specifically the fair exposure of relevant items retrieved by RAG systems, and investigates how this fairness impacts both the effectiveness of the systems and the attribution of sources in the generated output that users ultimately see. By experimenting with twelve RAG models across seven distinct tasks, we show that incorporating fairness-aware retrieval often maintains or even enhances both ranking quality and generation quality, countering the common belief that fairness compromises system performance. Additionally, we demonstrate that fair retrieval practices lead to more balanced attribution in the final responses, ensuring that the generator fairly cites the sources it relies on. Our findings underscore the importance of item-side fairness in retrieval and generation, laying the foundation for responsible and equitable RAG systems and guiding future research in fair ranking and attribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICTIR...</summary><p>ICTIR 2025 (Oral); NeurIPS 2024 AFME Workshop (Spotlight)</p></details> |

Within the ORAN architecture, Large Language Models (LLMs) can be specialized to generate xApps and rApps by leveraging specifications and API definitions from the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) platform. However, fine-tuning base LLMs for telecom-specific tasks remains expensive and resource-intensive. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a practical alternative through in-context learning, enabling domain adaptation without full retraining. While traditional RAG systems rely on vector-based retrieval, emerging variants such as GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG incorporate knowledge graphs or dual retrieval strategies to support multi-hop reasoning and improve factual grounding. Despite their promise, these methods lack systematic, metric-driven evaluations, particularly in high-stakes domains such as ORAN. In this study, we conduct a comparative evaluation of Vector RAG, GraphRAG, and Hybrid GraphRAG using ORAN specifications. We assess performance across varying question complexities using established generation metrics: faithfulness, answer relevance, context relevance, and factual correctness. Results show that both GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG outperform traditional RAG. Hybrid GraphRAG improves factual correctness by 8%, while GraphRAG improves context relevance by 7%.</p></details> |  |

National protocols and WHO recommendations are typically extensive and complex, making it difficult to extract precise information, especially during urgent situations. This project tackles that issue by developing a multilingual, intelligent question-answering system that transforms static vaccination guidelines into an interactive and user-friendly knowledge base. Built on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework and enhanced with agent-based reasoning (Agentic RAG), the system provides accurate, context-sensitive answers to complex medical queries. Evaluation shows that Agentic RAG outperforms traditional methods, particularly in addressing multi-step or ambiguous questions. To support clinical use, the system is integrated into a mobile application designed for real-time, point-of-care access to essential vaccine information.

| **[Efficient Knowledge Graph Construction and Retrieval from Unstructured Text for Large-Scale RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03226v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a scalable and cost-efficient framework for deploying Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) in enterprise environments. While GraphRAG has shown promise for multi-hop reasoning and structured retrieval, its adoption has been limited by the high computational cost of constructing knowledge graphs using large language models (LLMs) and the latency of graph-based retrieval. To address these challenges, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a dependency-based knowledge graph construction pipeline that leverages industrial-grade NLP libraries to extract entities and relations from unstructured text completely eliminating reliance on LLMs; and (2) a lightweight graph retrieval strategy that combines hybrid query node identification with efficient one-hop traversal for high-recall, low-latency subgraph extraction. We evaluate our framework on two SAP datasets focused on legacy code migration and demonstrate strong empirical performance. Our system achieves up to 15% and 4.35% improvements over traditional RAG baselines based on LLM-as-Judge and RAGAS metrics, respectively. Moreover, our dependency-based construction approach attains 94% of the performance of LLM-generated knowledge graphs (61.87% vs. 65.83%) while significantly reducing cost and improving scalability. These results validate the feasibility of deploying GraphRAG systems in real-world, large-scale enterprise applications without incurring prohibitive resource requirements paving the way for practical, explainable, and domain-adaptable retrieval-augmented reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[CyberRAG: An agentic RAG cyber attack classification and reporting tool](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02424v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) in large enterprises can generate hundreds of thousands of alerts per hour, overwhelming security analysts with logs that demand deep, rapidly evolving domain expertise. Conventional machine-learning detectors trim the alert volume but still yield high false-positive rates, while standard single-pass Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines often retrieve irrelevant context and fail to justify their predictions. To overcome these shortcomings, we present CyberRAG, a modular, agent-based RAG framework that delivers real-time classification, explanation, and structured reporting for cyber-attacks. A central LLM agent orchestrates (i) a pool of fine-tuned specialized classifiers, each tailored to a distinct attack family; (ii) tool adapters for enrichment and alerting; and (iii) an iterative retrieval-and-reason loop that continuously queries a domain-specific knowledge base until the evidence is both relevant and self-consistent. Unlike traditional RAG systems, CyberRAG embraces an agentic design that enables dynamic control flow and adaptive reasoning. This agent-centric architecture refines its threat labels and natural-language justifications autonomously, reducing false positives and enhancing interpretability. The framework is fully extensible: new attack types can be supported by simply adding a classifier without retraining the core agent. CyberRAG has been evaluated achieving over 94% accuracy per class and pushing final classification accuracy to 94.92% through semantic orchestration. Generated explanations score up to 0.94 in BERTScore and 4.9/5 in GPT-4-based expert evaluation. These results show that agentic, specialist-oriented RAG can pair high detection accuracy with trustworthy, SOC-ready prose, offering a practical and scalable path toward semi-autonomous cyber-defence workflows.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a generative AI-powered GATE question-answering framework (GATE stands for Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering) that leverages LLMs to explain GATE solutions and support students in their exam preparation. We conducted extensive benchmarking to select the optimal embedding model and LLM, evaluating our framework based on criteria such as latency, faithfulness, and relevance, with additional validation through human evaluation. Our chatbot integrates state-of-the-art embedding models and LLMs to deliver accurate, context-aware responses. Through rigorous experimentation, we identified configurations that balance performance and computational efficiency, ensuring a reliable chatbot to serve students' needs. Additionally, we discuss the challenges faced in data processing and modeling and implemented solutions. Our work explores the application of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for GATE Q/A explanation tasks, and our findings demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and response quality. This research offers practical insights for developing effective AI-driven educational tools while highlighting areas for future enhancement in usability and scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>One o...</summary><p>One of the co-authors is having conflict in the submission to arXiv due to many edits (we have to make changes in evaluation strategies, i.e. section 5); in the paper there are still formatting issues</p></details> |

Existing vector search and RAG solutions largely assume abundant computation resources, making them impractical for on-device scenarios. In this paper, we propose MobileRAG, a fully on-device pipeline that overcomes these limitations by combining a mobile-friendly vector search algorithm, \textit{EcoVector}, with a lightweight \textit{Selective Content Reduction} (SCR) method. By partitioning and partially loading index data, EcoVector drastically reduces both memory footprint and CPU usage, while the SCR method filters out irrelevant text to diminish Language Model (LM) input size without degrading accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrated that MobileRAG significantly outperforms conventional vector search and RAG methods in terms of latency, memory usage, and power consumption, while maintaining accuracy and enabling offline operation to safeguard privacy in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | 14 pages |

However, complex tasks requiring multi-round retrieval remain challenging, and early attempts tend to be overly optimistic without a good sense of self-skepticism. Current multi-round RAG systems may continue searching even when enough information has already been retrieved, or they may provide incorrect answers without having sufficient information or knowledge. Existing solutions either require large amounts of expensive human-labeled process supervision data or lead to subpar performance. This paper aims to address these limitations by introducing a new framework, SIM-RAG, to explicitly enhance RAG systems' self-awareness and multi-round retrieval capabilities. To train SIM-RAG, we first let a RAG system self-practice multi-round retrieval, augmenting existing question-answer pairs with intermediate inner monologue reasoning steps to generate synthetic training data. For each pair, the system may explore multiple retrieval paths, which are labeled as successful if they reach the correct answer and unsuccessful otherwise. Using this data, we train a lightweight information sufficiency Critic. At inference time, the Critic evaluates whether the RAG system has retrieved sufficient information at each round, guiding retrieval decisions and improving system-level self-awareness through in-context reinforcement learning. Experiments across multiple prominent RAG benchmarks show that SIM-RAG is an effective multi-round RAG solution. Furthermore, this framework is system-efficient, adding a lightweight component to RAG without requiring modifications to existing LLMs or search engines, and data-efficient, eliminating the need for costly human-annotated mid-step retrieval process supervision data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 48th International ACM SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

While traditional flight control relies on hardcoded equations, recent Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential for more flexible problem-solving but struggle with reliably selecting and applying correct mathematical formulations and executing precise multi-step arithmetic. We propose RAG-UAV, a retrieval-augmented generation framework designed to improve the mathematical reasoning of several LLMs (including GPT o1/Turbo, Llama-3.2/3.3, Mistral, and DeepSeek R1) in UAV-specific contexts by providing access to relevant domain literature. To conduct an initial assessment, we introduce the UAV-Math-Bench, a 20-question problem set of UAV-centric mathematical problems across four difficulty levels. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating retrieval substantially increases exact answer accuracy (achieving up to 75% with o1), reduces instances of incorrect formulation selection (from 25% without RAG to 5\% with RAG), and decreases numerical errors, reducing Mean Squared Error (MSE) by orders of magnitude for the best-performing models. This pilot study indicates that RAG can enable general-purpose LLMs to function as more reliable tools for engineering analysis, although direct real-time flight control requires further investigation and validation on a larger scale. All benchmark data, questions, and answers are publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures, 4 appendix subsections</p></details> |

The context for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems in most benchmarks comes from Wikipedia-like texts written in a neutral and factual tone. However, real-world RAG applications often retrieve internet-based text with diverse tones and linguistic styles, posing challenges for downstream tasks. This paper introduces (a) a dataset that transforms RAG-retrieved passages into emotionally inflected and sarcastic text, (b) an emotion translation model for adapting text to different tones, and (c) a prompt-based method to improve LLMs' pragmatic interpretation of retrieved text.</p></details> |  |

To mitigate these, recent methodologies have integrated information retrieved from external resources with LLMs, substantially enhancing their performance across NLP tasks. This survey paper addresses the absence of a comprehensive overview on Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RALMs), both Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Retrieval-Augmented Understanding (RAU), providing an in-depth examination of their paradigm, evolution, taxonomy, and applications. The paper discusses the essential components of RALMs, including Retrievers, Language Models, and Augmentations, and how their interactions lead to diverse model structures and applications. RALMs demonstrate utility in a spectrum of tasks, from translation and dialogue systems to knowledge-intensive applications. The survey includes several evaluation methods of RALMs, emphasizing the importance of robustness, accuracy, and relevance in their assessment. It also acknowledges the limitations of RALMs, particularly in retrieval quality and computational efficiency, offering directions for future research. In conclusion, this survey aims to offer a structured insight into RALMs, their potential, and the avenues for their future development in NLP.

The system is built on a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework, which integrates a curated knowledge base to ensure factual consistency. To enhance retrieval effectiveness across diverse question types, we implement a hybrid search strategy that combines dense vector similarity with sparse keyword-based retrieval. This dual-retrieval mechanism improves robustness for both general and domain-specific queries. The system includes a feedback loop in which students can rate responses and instructors can review and revise them. Instructor corrections are incorporated into the retrieval corpus, enabling adaptive refinement over time. The system was deployed in a classroom setting as a substitute for traditional office hours, where it successfully addressed a broad range of student queries. It was also used to provide technical support by integrating with a customer-specific knowledge base, demonstrating its ability to handle routine, context-sensitive tasks in applied domains.

However, LLMs often fail to faithfully integrate retrieved evidence into their generated responses, leading to factual inconsistencies. To quantify this gap, we introduce Entity-Context Divergence (ECD), a metric that measures the extent to which retrieved information is accurately reflected in model outputs. We systematically evaluate contemporary LLMs on their ability to preserve factual consistency in retrieval-augmented settings, a capability we define as RAG-ability. Our empirical analysis reveals that RAG-ability remains low across most LLMs, highlighting significant challenges in entity retention and context fidelity. This paper introduces Radiant (Retrieval AugmenteD entIty-context AligNmenT), a novel framework that merges RAG with alignment designed to optimize the interplay between retrieved evidence and generated content. Radiant extends Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to teach LLMs how to integrate provided additional information into subsequent generations. As a behavior correction mechanism, Radiant boosts RAG performance across varied retrieval scenarios, such as noisy web contexts, knowledge conflicts, and hallucination reduction. This enables more reliable, contextually grounded, and factually coherent content generation.</p></details> |  |

This research presents a complex framework that leverages Data Science methodologies, notably Large Language Models (LLM) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, to improve the efficiency of analyzing Calcutta High Court verdicts. Our framework focuses on two key aspects: first, the creation of a robust summarization mechanism that distills complex legal texts into concise and coherent summaries; and second, the development of an intelligent system for retrieving similar cases, which will assist legal professionals in research and decision making. By fine-tuning the Pegasus model using case head note summaries, we achieve significant improvements in the summarization of legal cases. Our two-step summarizing technique preserves crucial legal contexts, allowing for the production of a comprehensive vector database for RAG. The RAG-powered framework efficiently retrieves similar cases in response to user queries, offering thorough overviews and summaries. This technique not only improves legal research efficiency, but it also helps legal professionals and students easily acquire and grasp key legal information, benefiting the overall legal scenario.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Knowledge Augmented Finetuning Matters in both RAG and Agent Based Dialog Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22852v1)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to dialog systems. Despite making progress, LLMs are prone to errors in knowledge-intensive scenarios. Recently, approaches based on retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and agent have emerged to improve the factual accuracy by enhancing the LLMs with knowledge retrieved from external knowledge bases (KBs). This is mostly implemented by prompting the LLMs with instructions, examples and the retrieved knowledge. However, LLMs may have difficulty using the retrieved knowledge effectively for response generation, because they are not well trained to do such generation for specific domains. To mitigate this problem, we propose to finetune the LLMs in the RAG-based and agent-based systems with domain-specific data, together with domain-specific external knowledge, which is called knowledge augmented finetuning (KAFT). We base our study on the MobileCS2 dataset, a real-life customer service dialog dataset that features intensive knowledge interactions, to systematically compare the prompting and KAFT techniques in the RAG-based and agent-based systems. Experiment results show that KAFT substantially surpasses prompting in both RAG and agent systems, particularly in terms of factual accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this paper represents the first solid empirical work to investigate the KAFT idea.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents five domain-specific RAG applications developed for real-world scenarios across governance, cybersecurity, agriculture, industrial research, and medical diagnostics. Each system incorporates multilingual OCR, semantic retrieval via vector embeddings, and domain-adapted LLMs, deployed through local servers or cloud APIs to meet distinct user needs.

Answering questions over such content often requires joint reasoning across modalities, which strains traditional large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines due to token limitations, layout loss, and fragmented cross-modal context. We introduce MultiFinRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework purpose-built for financial QA. MultiFinRAG first performs multimodal extraction by grouping table and figure images into batches and sending them to a lightweight, quantized open-source multimodal LLM, which produces both structured JSON outputs and concise textual summaries. These outputs, along with narrative text, are embedded and indexed with modality-aware similarity thresholds for precise retrieval. A tiered fallback strategy then dynamically escalates from text-only to text+table+image contexts when necessary, enabling cross-modal reasoning while reducing irrelevant context. Despite running on commodity hardware, MultiFinRAG achieves 19 percentage points higher accuracy than ChatGPT-4o (free-tier) on complex financial QA tasks involving text, tables, images, and combined multimodal reasoning.</p></details> | Preprint Copy |

However, evaluating the multifaceted quality of RAG outputs, spanning aspects such as contextual coherence, query relevance, factual correctness, and informational completeness, poses significant challenges. Existing evaluation methods often rely on simple lexical overlap metrics, which are inadequate for capturing these nuances, or involve complex multi-stage pipelines with intermediate steps like claim extraction or require finetuning specialized judge models, hindering practical efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose CCRS (Contextual Coherence and Relevance Score), a novel suite of five metrics that utilizes a single, powerful, pretrained LLM as a zero-shot, end-to-end judge. CCRS evaluates: Contextual Coherence (CC), Question Relevance (QR), Information Density (ID), Answer Correctness (AC), and Information Recall (IR). We apply CCRS to evaluate six diverse RAG system configurations on the challenging BioASQ dataset. Our analysis demonstrates that CCRS effectively discriminates between system performances, confirming, for instance, that the Mistral-7B reader outperforms Llama variants. We provide a detailed analysis of CCRS metric properties, including score distributions, convergent/discriminant validity, tie rates, population statistics, and discriminative power. Compared to the complex RAGChecker framework, CCRS offers comparable or superior discriminative power for key aspects like recall and faithfulness, while being significantly more computationally efficient. CCRS thus provides a practical, comprehensive, and efficient framework for evaluating and iteratively improving RAG systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at LLM4Eval @ SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

While the effectiveness of the retrieval module is typically evaluated with relevance-based ranking metrics, such metrics may be insufficient to reflect the retrieval's impact on the final RAG result, especially in long-form generation scenarios. We argue that providing a comprehensive retrieval-augmented context is important for long-form RAG tasks like report generation and propose metrics for assessing the context independent of generation. We introduce CRUX, a \textbf{C}ontrolled \textbf{R}etrieval-a\textbf{U}gmented conte\textbf{X}t evaluation framework designed to directly assess retrieval-augmented contexts. This framework uses human-written summaries to control the information scope of knowledge, enabling us to measure how well the context covers information essential for long-form generation. CRUX uses question-based evaluation to assess RAG's retrieval in a fine-grained manner. Empirical results show that CRUX offers more reflective and diagnostic evaluation. Our findings also reveal substantial room for improvement in current retrieval methods, pointing to promising directions for advancing RAG's retrieval. Our data and code are publicly available to support and advance future research on retrieval.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, we propose Temporal Causal Probabilistic Description Logic (T-CPDL), an integrated framework that extends traditional Description Logic with temporal interval operators, explicit causal relationships, and probabilistic annotations. We present two distinct variants of T-CPDL: one capturing qualitative temporal relationships through Allen's interval algebra, and another variant enriched with explicit timestamped causal assertions. Both variants share a unified logical structure, enabling complex reasoning tasks ranging from simple temporal ordering to nuanced probabilistic causation. Empirical evaluations on temporal reasoning and causal inference benchmarks confirm that T-CPDL substantially improves inference accuracy, interpretability, and confidence calibration of language model outputs. By delivering transparent reasoning paths and fine-grained temporal and causal semantics, T-CPDL significantly enhances the capability of language models to support robust, explainable, and trustworthy decision-making. This work also lays the groundwork for developing advanced Logic-Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Logic-RAG) frameworks, potentially boosting the reasoning capabilities and efficiency of knowledge graph-enhanced RAG systems.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we introduce a modular AI system that leverages a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to automate standard applicability determination. Given a free-text device description, our system retrieves candidate standards from a curated corpus and uses large language models to infer jurisdiction-specific applicability, classified as Mandatory, Recommended, or Not Applicable, with traceable justifications. We construct an international benchmark dataset of medical device descriptions with expert-annotated standard mappings, and evaluate our system against retrieval-only, zero-shot, and rule-based baselines. The proposed approach attains a classification accuracy of 73% and a Top-5 retrieval recall of 87%, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying relevant regulatory standards. We introduce the first end-to-end system for standard applicability reasoning, enabling scalable and interpretable AI-supported regulatory science. Notably, our region-aware RAG agent performs cross-jurisdictional reasoning between Chinese and U.S. standards, supporting conflict resolution and applicability justification across regulatory frameworks.</p></details> |  |

| **[From Unstructured Communication to Intelligent RAG: Multi-Agent Automation for Supply Chain Knowledge Bases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17484v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supply chain operations generate vast amounts of operational data; however, critical knowledge such as system usage practices, troubleshooting workflows, and resolution techniques often remains buried within unstructured communications like support tickets, emails, and chat logs. While RAG systems aim to leverage such communications as a knowledge base, their effectiveness is limited by raw data challenges: support tickets are typically noisy, inconsistent, and incomplete, making direct retrieval suboptimal. Unlike existing RAG approaches that focus on runtime optimization, we introduce a novel offline-first methodology that transforms these communications into a structured knowledge base. Our key innovation is a LLMs-based multi-agent system orchestrating three specialized agents: Category Discovery for taxonomy creation, Categorization for ticket grouping, and Knowledge Synthesis for article generation. Applying our methodology to real-world support tickets with resolution notes and comments, our system creates a compact knowledge base - reducing total volume to just 3.4% of original ticket data while improving quality. Experiments demonstrate that our prebuilt knowledge base in RAG systems significantly outperforms traditional RAG implementations (48.74% vs. 38.60% helpful answers) and achieves a 77.4% reduction in unhelpful responses. By automating institutional knowledge capture that typically remains siloed in experts' heads, our solution translates to substantial operational efficiency: reducing support workload, accelerating resolution times, and creating self-improving systems that automatically resolve approximately 50% of future supply chain tickets. Our approach addresses a key gap in knowledge management by transforming transient communications into structured, reusable knowledge through intelligent offline processing rather than latency-inducing runtime architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted In Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on AI for Supply Chain: Today and Future @ 31st ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining V.2 (KDD 25), August 3, 2025, Toronto, ON, Canada.

However, they also exhibit inherent limitations, such as outdated knowledge and susceptibility to hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm to address these issues, but it also introduces new vulnerabilities. Recent efforts have focused on the security of RAG-based LLMs, yet existing attack methods face three critical challenges: (1) their effectiveness declines sharply when only a limited number of poisoned texts can be injected into the knowledge database, (2) they lack sufficient stealth, as the attacks are often detectable by anomaly detection systems, which compromises their effectiveness, and (3) they rely on heuristic approaches to generate poisoned texts, lacking formal optimization frameworks and theoretic guarantees, which limits their effectiveness and applicability. To address these issues, we propose coordinated Prompt-RAG attack (PR-attack), a novel optimization-driven attack that introduces a small number of poisoned texts into the knowledge database while embedding a backdoor trigger within the prompt. When activated, the trigger causes the LLM to generate pre-designed responses to targeted queries, while maintaining normal behavior in other contexts. This ensures both high effectiveness and stealth. We formulate the attack generation process as a bilevel optimization problem leveraging a principled optimization framework to develop optimal poisoned texts and triggers. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PR-Attack, achieving a high attack success rate even with a limited number of poisoned texts and significantly improved stealth compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

Given the challenges in continual learning with large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become the dominant way to introduce new information. However, its reliance on vector retrieval hinders its ability to mimic the dynamic and interconnected nature of human long-term memory. Recent RAG approaches augment vector embeddings with various structures like knowledge graphs to address some of these gaps, namely sense-making and associativity. However, their performance on more basic factual memory tasks drops considerably below standard RAG. We address this unintended deterioration and propose HippoRAG 2, a framework that outperforms standard RAG comprehensively on factual, sense-making, and associative memory tasks. HippoRAG 2 builds upon the Personalized PageRank algorithm used in HippoRAG and enhances it with deeper passage integration and more effective online use of an LLM. This combination pushes this RAG system closer to the effectiveness of human long-term memory, achieving a 7% improvement in associative memory tasks over the state-of-the-art embedding model while also exhibiting superior factual knowledge and sense-making memory capabilities. This work paves the way for non-parametric continual learning for LLMs. Code and data are available at https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/HippoRAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025.

However, numerous methodologies frequently neglect the calibration capabilities of large language models (LLMs), which capitalize on their robust in-context reasoning prowess. This work illustrates that providing LLMs with specific cues substantially improves their calibration efficacy, especially in multi-round calibrations. We present a new SGIC: Self-Guided Iterative Calibration Framework that employs uncertainty scores as a tool. Initially, this framework calculates uncertainty scores to determine both the relevance of each document to the query and the confidence level in the responses produced by the LLMs. Subsequently, it reevaluates these scores iteratively, amalgamating them with prior responses to refine calibration. Furthermore, we introduce an innovative approach for constructing an iterative self-calibration training set, which optimizes LLMs to efficiently harness uncertainty scores for capturing critical information and enhancing response accuracy. Our proposed framework significantly improves performance on both closed-source and open-weight LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Legal texts are characterized by a predefined hierarchical structure, an extensive network of references and a continuous evolution through multiple temporal versions. This temporal dynamism poses a significant challenge for standard AI systems, demanding a deterministic representation of the law at any given point in time. To address this, our approach grounds the knowledge graph construction in a formal, FRBRoo-inspired model that distinguishes abstract legal works from their concrete textual expressions. We introduce a multi-layered representation of Temporal Versions (capturing date-specific changes) and Language Versions (capturing linguistic variations). By modeling normative evolution as a precise sequence of these versioned entities, we enable the construction of a knowledge graph that serves as a verifiable "ground truth". This allows Large Language Models to generate responses based on accurate, context-aware, and point-in-time correct legal information, overcoming the risk of temporal inaccuracies. Through a detailed analysis of this formal Graph RAG approach and its application to legal norm datasets, this article aims to advance the field of Artificial Intelligence applied to Law, creating opportunities for more effective and reliable systems in legal research, legislative analysis, and decision support.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version enhances the theoretical underpinnings of the proposed Graph RAG methodology, including the introduction of a formal, FRBRoo-based model for versioning, and enabling multi-language support for both content and metadata</p></details> |

It shows that LLMs struggle to capture the root causes of vulnerabilities during vulnerability detection. To address this challenge, we propose enhancing LLMs with multi-dimensional vulnerability knowledge distilled from historical vulnerabilities and fixes. We design a novel knowledge-level Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework Vul-RAG, which improves LLMs with an accuracy increase of 16% - 24% in identifying vulnerable and patched code. Additionally, vulnerability knowledge generated by Vul-RAG can further (1) serve as high-quality explanations to improve manual detection accuracy (from 60% to 77%), and (2) detect 10 previously-unknown bugs in the recent Linux kernel release with 6 assigned CVEs.</p></details> |  |

The LiveRAG 2025 challenge explores RAG solutions to maximize accuracy on DataMorgana's QA pairs, which are composed of single-hop and multi-hop questions. The challenge provides access to sparse OpenSearch and dense Pinecone indices of the Fineweb 10BT dataset. It restricts model use to LLMs with up to 10B parameters and final answer generation with Falcon-3-10B. A judge-LLM assesses the submitted answers along with human evaluators.

While large language models (LLMs) facilitate dynamic pedagogical interactions, hallucinations undermine confidence, trust, and instructional value. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) grounds LLM outputs in curated knowledge but requires a clear semantic link between user input and a knowledge base, which is often weak in student dialogue. We propose log-contextualized RAG (LC-RAG), which enhances RAG retrieval by using environment logs to contextualize collaborative discourse. Our findings show that LC-RAG improves retrieval over a discourse-only baseline and allows our collaborative peer agent, Copa, to deliver relevant, personalized guidance that supports students' critical thinking and epistemic decision-making in a collaborative computational modeling environment, C2STEM.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED25) Workshop on Epistemics and Decision-Making in AI-Supported Education</p></details> |

When a user submits a query, RAG executes a vector search to find relevant documents, which are then used to generate a response. However, ensuring the relevance of retrieved documents with a query would be a big challenge. To address this, a secondary model, known as a relevant grader, can be served to verify its relevance. To reduce computational requirements of a relevant grader, a lightweight small language model is preferred. In this work, we finetuned llama-3.2-1b as a relevant grader and achieved a significant increase in precision from 0.1301 to 0.7750. Its precision is comparable to that of llama-3.1-70b. Our code is available at https://github.com/taeheej/Lightweight-Relevance-Grader-in-RAG.</p></details> |  |

While RDF/OWL reasoners enable graph-based reasoning, they are limited to fragments of first-order logic, preventing deeper temporal and semantic analysis. This paper addresses both challenges by developing automatic historical event extraction models using multiple LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Llama 3.2) with three enhancement strategies: pure base generation, knowledge graph enhancement, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). We conducted comprehensive evaluations using historical texts from Thucydides. Our findings reveal that enhancement strategies optimize different performance dimensions rather than providing universal improvements. For coverage and historical breadth, base generation achieves optimal performance with Claude and GPT-4 extracting comprehensive events. However, for precision, RAG enhancement improves coordinate accuracy and metadata completeness. Model architecture fundamentally determines enhancement sensitivity: larger models demonstrate robust baseline performance with incremental RAG improvements, while Llama 3.2 shows extreme variance from competitive performance to complete failure. We then developed an automated translation pipeline converting extracted RDF representations into Coq proof assistant specifications, enabling higher-order reasoning beyond RDF capabilities including multi-step causal verification, temporal arithmetic with BC dates, and formal proofs about historical causation. The Coq formalization validates that RAG-discovered event types represent legitimate domain-specific semantic structures rather than ontological violations.</p></details> |  |

Traditional RAG pipelines often suffer from high latency and limited accuracy over massive, diverse datasets. DoTA-RAG addresses these challenges with a three-stage pipeline: query rewriting, dynamic routing to specialized sub-indexes, and multi-stage retrieval and ranking. We further enhance retrieval by evaluating and selecting a superior embedding model, re-embedding the large FineWeb-10BT corpus. Moreover, we create a diverse Q&A dataset of 500 questions generated via the DataMorgana setup across a broad range of WebOrganizer topics and formats. DoTA-RAG improves the answer correctness score from 0.752 (baseline, using LiveRAG pre-built vector store) to 1.478 while maintaining low latency, and it achieves a 0.929 correctness score on the Live Challenge Day. These results highlight DoTA-RAG's potential for practical deployment in domains requiring fast, reliable access to large and evolving knowledge sources.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIGIR...</summary><p>SIGIR LiveRAG 2025 (oral presentation)</p></details> |

Current approaches to supporting research idea generation often rely on generic large language models (LLMs). While LLMs are effective at aiding comprehension and summarization, they often fall short in guiding users toward practical research ideas due to their limitations. In this study, we present a novel structural framework for research ideation. Our framework, The Budget AI Researcher, uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) chains, vector databases, and topic-guided pairing to recombine concepts from hundreds of machine learning papers. The system ingests papers from nine major AI conferences, which collectively span the vast subfields of machine learning, and organizes them into a hierarchical topic tree. It uses the tree to identify distant topic pairs, generate novel research abstracts, and refine them through iterative self-evaluation against relevant literature and peer reviews, generating and refining abstracts that are both grounded in real-world research and demonstrably interesting. Experiments using LLM-based metrics indicate that our method significantly improves the concreteness of generated research ideas relative to standard prompting approaches. Human evaluations further demonstrate a substantial enhancement in the perceived interestingness of the outputs. By bridging the gap between academic data and creative generation, the Budget AI Researcher offers a practical, free tool for accelerating scientific discovery and lowering the barrier for aspiring researchers. Beyond research ideation, this approach inspires solutions to the broader challenge of generating personalized, context-aware outputs grounded in evolving real-world knowledge.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inten...</summary><p>Intended for AAAI's AI4Research Workshop</p></details> |

Data augmentation can potentially alleviate the data shortage, but augmenting vulnerable code is challenging and requires a generative solution that maintains vulnerability. Previous works have only focused on generating samples that contain single statements or specific types of vulnerabilities. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to solve various code generation and comprehension tasks with inspiring results, especially when fused with retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Therefore, we propose VulScribeR, a novel LLM-based solution that leverages carefully curated prompt templates to augment vulnerable datasets. More specifically, we explore three strategies to augment both single and multi-statement vulnerabilities, with LLMs, namely Mutation, Injection, and Extension. Our extensive evaluation across four vulnerability datasets and DLVD models, using three LLMs, show that our approach beats two SOTA methods Vulgen and VGX, and Random Oversampling (ROS) by 27.48%, 27.93%, and 15.41% in f1-score with 5K generated vulnerable samples on average, and 53.84%, 54.10%, 69.90%, and 40.93% with 15K generated vulnerable samples. Our approach demonstrates its feasibility for large-scale data augmentation by generating 1K samples at as cheap as US$ 1.88.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables, 3 prompt templates, 1 algorithm</p></details> |
| **[Bias Amplification in RAG: Poisoning Knowledge Retrieval to Steer LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11415v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Large Language Models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems can significantly enhance the performance of large language models by integrating external knowledge. However, RAG also introduces new security risks. Existing research focuses mainly on how poisoning attacks in RAG systems affect model output quality, overlooking their potential to amplify model biases. For example, when querying about domestic violence victims, a compromised RAG system might preferentially retrieve documents depicting women as victims, causing the model to generate outputs that perpetuate gender stereotypes even when the original query is gender neutral. To show the impact of the bias, this paper proposes a Bias Retrieval and Reward Attack (BRRA) framework, which systematically investigates attack pathways that amplify language model biases through a RAG system manipulation. We design an adversarial document generation method based on multi-objective reward functions, employ subspace projection techniques to manipulate retrieval results, and construct a cyclic feedback mechanism for continuous bias amplification. Experiments on multiple mainstream large language models demonstrate that BRRA attacks can significantly enhance model biases in dimensions. In addition, we explore a dual stage defense mechanism to effectively mitigate the impacts of the attack. This study reveals that poisoning attacks in RAG systems directly amplify model output biases and clarifies the relationship between RAG system security and model fairness. This novel potential attack indicates that we need to keep an eye on the fairness issues of the RAG system.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities to automate this translation. However, existing models still struggle with understanding domain-specific syntax and semantics. To enhance LLM performance in NL2SVA, we propose a customized retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework and a synthetic fine-tuning dataset that together improve LLM's performance. To further improve lightweight models over NL2SVA, our fine-tuning dataset provides prompt-guided explanations that teach LLMs the layer-by-layer construction process of concurrent SVAs, enabling supervised fine-tuning that greatly improves syntax and functionality accuracy. To evaluate the performance of LLMs over NL2SVA, we construct the largest evaluation dataset for NL2SVA, comprising 40 Verilog designs and 229 formally verified SVAs with detailed annotations. Experimental results show that our customized RAG framework increases the number of functionality matched SVAs by 58.42% over GPT-4o-mini, while Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct fine-tuned on our fine-tuning dataset and integrated with HybridRetrieval achieves a 59.05% over the base Qwen model.</p></details> |  |

This study evaluates the efficacy of two augmentation strategies--Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE)--on compact Gemma LLMs of 1 billion and 4 billion parameters, within the context of a privacy-first personal assistant. We implement short-term memory via MongoDB and long-term semantic storage via Qdrant, orchestrated through FastAPI and LangChain, and expose the system through a React.js frontend. Across both model scales, RAG consistently reduces latency by up to 17\% and eliminates factual hallucinations when responding to user-specific and domain-specific queries. HyDE, by contrast, enhances semantic relevance--particularly for complex physics prompts--but incurs a 25--40\% increase in response time and a non-negligible hallucination rate in personal-data retrieval. Comparing 1 B to 4 B models, we observe that scaling yields marginal throughput gains for baseline and RAG pipelines, but magnifies HyDE's computational overhead and variability.

While early RAG systems based on static pipelines have shown effectiveness in well-structured tasks, they struggle in real-world scenarios requiring complex reasoning, dynamic retrieval, and multi-modal integration. To address these challenges, the field has shifted toward Reasoning Agentic RAG, a paradigm that embeds decision-making and adaptive tool use directly into the retrieval process. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of Reasoning Agentic RAG methods, categorizing them into two primary systems: predefined reasoning, which follows fixed modular pipelines to boost reasoning, and agentic reasoning, where the model autonomously orchestrates tool interaction during inference. We analyze representative techniques under both paradigms, covering architectural design, reasoning strategies, and tool coordination. Finally, we discuss key research challenges and propose future directions to advance the flexibility, robustness, and applicability of reasoning agentic RAG systems.

However, existing methods typically rely on a single source, either unstructured text or structured knowledge. Moreover, they lack cognitively inspired mechanisms for activating relevant knowledge. To address these issues, we propose KG-Infused RAG, a framework that integrates KGs into RAG systems to implement spreading activation, a cognitive process that enables concept association and inference. KG-Infused RAG retrieves KG facts, expands the query accordingly, and enhances generation by combining corpus passages with structured facts, enabling interpretable, multi-source retrieval grounded in semantic structure. We further improve KG-Infused RAG via preference learning on sampled key stages in the pipeline. Experiments on five QA benchmarks show that KG-Infused RAG consistently outperforms vanilla RAG (by 3.8% to 13.8%). Additionally, when integrated into Self-RAG, KG-Infused RAG brings further performance gains, demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility as a plug-and-play enhancement module for corpus-based RAG methods.</p></details> |  |

RAG systems combine traditional search capabilities with LLMs to generate comprehensive answers to user queries, ideally with accurate citations. However, in our experience of developing a RAG product, LLMs often struggle with source attribution, aligning with other industry studies reporting citation accuracy rates of only about 74% for popular generative search engines. To address this, we present efficient post-processing algorithms to improve citation accuracy in LLM-generated responses, with minimal impact on latency and cost. Our approaches cross-check generated citations against retrieved articles using methods including keyword + semantic matching, fine tuned model with BERTScore, and a lightweight LLM-based technique. Our experimental results demonstrate a relative improvement of 15.46% in the overall accuracy metrics of our RAG system. This significant enhancement potentially enables a shift from our current larger language model to a relatively smaller model that is approximately 12x more cost-effective and 3x faster in inference time, while maintaining comparable performance. This research contributes to enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of AI-generated content in information retrieval and summarization tasks which is critical to gain customer trust especially in commercial products.</p></details> |  |

Existing watermarking methods in RAG focus solely on textual knowledge, leaving image knowledge unprotected. In this work, we propose AQUA, the first watermark framework for image knowledge protection in Multimodal RAG systems. AQUA embeds semantic signals into synthetic images using two complementary methods: acronym-based triggers and spatial relationship cues. These techniques ensure watermark signals survive indirect watermark propagation from image retriever to textual generator, being efficient, effective and imperceptible. Experiments across diverse models and datasets show that AQUA enables robust, stealthy, and reliable copyright tracing, filling a key gap in multimodal RAG protection.</p></details> |  |

Uncertainty Estimation (UE) quantifies the model's confidence and helps users assess response reliability. However, existing UE methods have not been thoroughly examined in scenarios like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), where the input prompt includes non-parametric knowledge. This paper shows that current UE methods cannot reliably assess correctness in the RAG setting. We further propose an axiomatic framework to identify deficiencies in existing methods and guide the development of improved approaches. Our framework introduces five constraints that an effective UE method should meet after incorporating retrieved documents into the LLM's prompt. Experimental results reveal that no existing UE method fully satisfies all the axioms, explaining their suboptimal performance in RAG. We further introduce a simple yet effective calibration function based on our framework, which not only satisfies more axioms than baseline methods but also improves the correlation between uncertainty estimates and correctness.</p></details> |  |

The information needs regarding datasets are implicitly embedded in particular research tasks, rather than explicitly expressed in search queries. However, existing scientific retrieval and question-answering (QA) datasets typically address straightforward questions, which do not align with the distribution of real-world research inquiries. To bridge this gap, we developed ScIRGen, a dataset generation framework for scientific QA \& retrieval that more accurately reflects the information needs of professional science researchers, and uses it to create a large-scale scientific retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) dataset with realistic queries, datasets and papers. Technically, we designed a dataset-oriented information extraction method that leverages academic papers to augment the dataset representation. We then proposed a question generation framework by employing cognitive taxonomy to ensure the quality of synthesized questions. We also design a method to automatically filter synthetic answers based on the perplexity shift of LLMs, which is highly aligned with human judgment of answers' validity. Collectively, these methodologies culminated in the creation of the 61k QA dataset, ScIRGen-Geo. We benchmarked representative methods on the ScIRGen-Geo dataset for their question-answering and retrieval capabilities, finding out that current methods still suffer from reasoning from complex questions.

| **[GaRAGe: A Benchmark with Grounding Annotations for RAG Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07671v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present GaRAGe, a large RAG benchmark with human-curated long-form answers and annotations of each grounding passage, allowing a fine-grained evaluation of whether LLMs can identify relevant grounding when generating RAG answers. Our benchmark contains 2366 questions of diverse complexity, dynamism, and topics, and includes over 35K annotated passages retrieved from both private document sets and the Web, to reflect real-world RAG use cases. This makes it an ideal test bed to evaluate an LLM's ability to identify only the relevant information necessary to compose a response, or provide a deflective response when there is insufficient information. Evaluations of multiple state-of-the-art LLMs on GaRAGe show that the models tend to over-summarise rather than (a) ground their answers strictly on the annotated relevant passages (reaching at most a Relevance-Aware Factuality Score of 60%), or (b) deflect when no relevant grounding is available (reaching at most 31% true positive rate in deflections). The F1 in attribution to relevant sources is at most 58.9%, and we show that performance is particularly reduced when answering time-sensitive questions and when having to draw knowledge from sparser private grounding sources.</p></details> | ACL 2025 (Findings) |
| **[LlamaRec-LKG-RAG: A Single-Pass, Learnable Knowledge Graph-RAG Framework for LLM-Based Ranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07449v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven their adoption in recommender systems through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks. However, existing RAG approaches predominantly rely on flat, similarity-based retrieval that fails to leverage the rich relational structure inherent in user-item interactions. We introduce LlamaRec-LKG-RAG, a novel single-pass, end-to-end trainable framework that integrates personalized knowledge graph context into LLM-based recommendation ranking. Our approach extends the LlamaRec architecture by incorporating a lightweight user preference module that dynamically identifies salient relation paths within a heterogeneous knowledge graph constructed from user behavior and item metadata. These personalized subgraphs are seamlessly integrated into prompts for a fine-tuned Llama-2 model, enabling efficient and interpretable recommendations through a unified inference step. Comprehensive experiments on ML-100K and Amazon Beauty datasets demonstrate consistent and significant improvements over LlamaRec across key ranking metrics (MRR, NDCG, Recall). LlamaRec-LKG-RAG demonstrates the critical value of structured reasoning in LLM-based recommendations and establishes a foundation for scalable, knowledge-aware personalization in next-generation recommender systems. Code is available at~\href{https://github.com/VahidAz/LlamaRec-LKG-RAG}{repository}.</p></details> |  |
| **[MrM: Black-Box Membership Inference Attacks against Multimodal RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07399v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems enhance large vision-language models by integrating cross-modal knowledge, enabling their increasing adoption across real-world multimodal tasks. These knowledge databases may contain sensitive information that requires privacy protection. However, multimodal RAG systems inherently grant external users indirect access to such data, making them potentially vulnerable to privacy attacks, particularly membership inference attacks (MIAs). % Existing MIA methods targeting RAG systems predominantly focus on the textual modality, while the visual modality remains relatively underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose MrM, the first black-box MIA framework targeted at multimodal RAG systems. It utilizes a multi-object data perturbation framework constrained by counterfactual attacks, which can concurrently induce the RAG systems to retrieve the target data and generate information that leaks the membership information. Our method first employs an object-aware data perturbation method to constrain the perturbation to key semantics and ensure successful retrieval. Building on this, we design a counterfact-informed mask selection strategy to prioritize the most informative masked regions, aiming to eliminate the interference of model self-knowledge and amplify attack efficacy. Finally, we perform statistical membership inference by modeling query trials to extract features that reflect the reconstruction of masked semantics from response patterns. Experiments on two visual datasets and eight mainstream commercial visual-language models (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2) demonstrate that MrM achieves consistently strong performance across both sample-level and set-level evaluations, and remains robust under adaptive defenses.</p></details> |  |
| **[BRIGHT+: Upgrading the BRIGHT Benchmark with MARCUS, a Multi-Agent RAG Clean-Up Suite](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07116v1)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems require corpora that are both structurally clean and semantically coherent. BRIGHT is a recent and influential benchmark designed to evaluate complex multi-hop retrieval across diverse, high-reasoning domains. However, its practical effectiveness is limited by common web-crawled artifacts - such as content redundancy and semantic discontinuity - that impair retrieval accuracy and downstream reasoning. Notably, we find that such issues are concentrated in seven StackExchange-derived subdomains, while other domains (e.g., Coding and Theorem-based content) remain relatively clean. In this study, we present MARCUS, a multi-agent pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to systematically clean and re-chunk BRIGHT into a higher-quality corpus: BRIGHT-Plus. MARCUS applies dedicated agents for structural noise removal and semantic segmentation, preserving answer-bearing spans while improving contextual integrity. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that BRIGHT-Plus yields consistent and significant improvements in both retrieval accuracy and multi-hop reasoning across a diverse set of retrievers. We release both the BRIGHT-Plus corpus and the MARCUS pipeline to support future research on robust, reasoning-centric retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables.

| **[Graph-based RAG Enhancement via Global Query Disambiguation and Dependency-Aware Reranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11106v1)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contemporary graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods typically begin by extracting entities from user queries and then leverage pre-constructed knowledge graphs to retrieve related relationships and metadata. However, this pipeline's exclusive reliance on entity-level extraction can lead to the misinterpretation or omission of latent yet critical information and relations. As a result, retrieved content may be irrelevant or contradictory, and essential knowledge may be excluded, exacerbating hallucination risks and degrading the fidelity of generated responses. To address these limitations, we introduce PankRAG, a framework that combines a globally aware, hierarchical query-resolution strategy with a novel dependency-aware reranking mechanism. PankRAG first constructs a multi-level resolution path that captures both parallel and sequential interdependencies within a query, guiding large language models (LLMs) through structured reasoning. It then applies its dependency-aware reranker to exploit the dependency structure among resolved sub-questions, enriching and validating retrieval results for subsequent sub-questions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that PankRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across multiple benchmarks, underscoring its robustness and generalizability.</p></details> |  |
| **[E^2GraphRAG: Streamlining Graph-based RAG for High Efficiency and Effectiveness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24226v4)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based RAG methods like GraphRAG have shown promising global understanding of the knowledge base by constructing hierarchical entity graphs. However, they often suffer from inefficiency and rely on manually pre-defined query modes, limiting practical use. In this paper, we propose E^2GraphRAG, a streamlined graph-based RAG framework that improves both Efficiency and Effectiveness. During the indexing stage, E^2GraphRAG constructs a summary tree with large language models and an entity graph with SpaCy based on document chunks. We then construct bidirectional indexes between entities and chunks to capture their many-to-many relationships, enabling fast lookup during both local and global retrieval. For the retrieval stage, we design an adaptive retrieval strategy that leverages the graph structure to retrieve and select between local and global modes. Experiments show that E^2GraphRAG achieves up to 10 times faster indexing than GraphRAG and 100 times speedup over LightRAG in retrieval while maintaining competitive QA performance.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Small Models, Big Support: A Local LLM Framework for Teacher-Centric Content Creation and Assessment using RAG and CAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05925v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized as student-facing educational aids, their potential to directly support educators, particularly through locally deployable and customizable open-source solutions, remains significantly underexplored. Many existing educational solutions rely on cloud-based infrastructure or proprietary tools, which are costly and may raise privacy concerns. Regulated industries with limited budgets require affordable, self-hosted solutions. We introduce an end-to-end, open-source framework leveraging small (3B-7B parameters), locally deployed LLMs for customized teaching material generation and assessment. Our system uniquely incorporates an interactive loop crucial for effective small-model refinement, and an auxiliary LLM verifier to mitigate jailbreaking risks, enhancing output reliability and safety. Utilizing Retrieval and Context Augmented Generation (RAG/CAG), it produces factually accurate, customized pedagogically-styled content. Deployed on-premises for data privacy and validated through an evaluation pipeline and a college physics pilot, our findings show that carefully engineered small LLM systems can offer robust, affordable, practical, and safe educator support, achieving utility comparable to larger models for targeted tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[ECoRAG: Evidentiality-guided Compression for Long Context RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05167v2)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in Open-Domain Question Answering (ODQA) by leveraging external documents through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To reduce RAG overhead, from longer context, context compression is necessary. However, prior compression methods do not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, which limit the performance in LLM-based RAG. We thus propose Evidentiality-guided RAG, or ECoRAG framework. ECoRAG improves LLM performance by compressing retrieved documents based on evidentiality, ensuring whether answer generation is supported by the correct evidence. As an additional step, ECoRAG reflects whether the compressed content provides sufficient evidence, and if not, retrieves more until sufficient. Experiments show that ECoRAG improves LLM performance on ODQA tasks, outperforming existing compression methods. Furthermore, ECoRAG is highly cost-efficient, as it not only reduces latency but also minimizes token usage by retaining only the necessary information to generate the correct answer. Code is available at https://github.com/ldilab/ECoRAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAGE: A Framework of Precise Retrieval for RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01713v3)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated significant proficiency in conducting question-answering (QA) tasks within a specified corpus. Nonetheless, numerous failure instances of RAG in QA still exist. These failures are not solely attributable to the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs); instead, they predominantly arise from the retrieval of inaccurate information for LLMs due to two limitations: (1) Current RAG methods segment the corpus without considering semantics, making it difficult to find relevant context due to impaired correlation between questions and the segments. (2) There is a trade-off between missing essential context with fewer context retrieved and getting irrelevant context with more context retrieved. In this paper, we introduce a RAG framework (SAGE), to overcome these limitations. First, to address the segmentation issue without considering semantics, we propose to train a semantic segmentation model. This model is trained to segment the corpus into semantically complete chunks. Second, to ensure that only the most relevant chunks are retrieved while the irrelevant ones are ignored, we design a chunk selection algorithm to dynamically select chunks based on the decreasing speed of the relevance score, leading to a more relevant selection. Third, to further ensure the precision of the retrieved chunks, we propose letting LLMs assess whether retrieved chunks are excessive or lacking and then adjust the amount of context accordingly. Experiments show that SAGE outperforms baselines by 61.25% in the quality of QA on average. Moreover, by avoiding retrieving noisy context, SAGE lowers the cost of the tokens consumed in LLM inference and achieves a 49.41% enhancement in cost efficiency on average. Additionally, our work offers valuable insights for boosting RAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[FinSage: A Multi-aspect RAG System for Financial Filings Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14493v3)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging large language models in real-world settings often entails a need to utilize domain-specific data and tools in order to follow the complex regulations that need to be followed for acceptable use. Within financial sectors, modern enterprises increasingly rely on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to address complex compliance requirements in financial document workflows. However, existing solutions struggle to account for the inherent heterogeneity of data (e.g., text, tables, diagrams) and evolving nature of regulatory standards used in financial filings, leading to compromised accuracy in critical information extraction. We propose the FinSage framework as a solution, utilizing a multi-aspect RAG framework tailored for regulatory compliance analysis in multi-modal financial documents. FinSage introduces three innovative components: (1) a multi-modal pre-processing pipeline that unifies diverse data formats and generates chunk-level metadata summaries, (2) a multi-path sparse-dense retrieval system augmented with query expansion (HyDE) and metadata-aware semantic search, and (3) a domain-specialized re-ranking module fine-tuned via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to prioritize compliance-critical content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FinSage achieves an impressive recall of 92.51% on 75 expert-curated questions derived from surpasses the best baseline method on the FinanceBench question answering datasets by 24.06% in accuracy. Moreover, FinSage has been successfully deployed as financial question-answering agent in online meetings, where it has already served more than 1,200 people.</p></details> |  |
| **[When to use Graphs in RAG: A Comprehensive Analysis for Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05690v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. It leverages graphs to model the hierarchical structure between specific concepts, enabling more coherent and effective knowledge retrieval for accurate reasoning.Despite its conceptual promise, recent studies report that GraphRAG frequently underperforms vanilla RAG on many real-world tasks. This raises a critical question: Is GraphRAG really effective, and in which scenarios do graph structures provide measurable benefits for RAG systems? To address this, we propose GraphRAG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate GraphRAG models onboth hierarchical knowledge retrieval and deep contextual reasoning. GraphRAG-Bench features a comprehensive dataset with tasks of increasing difficulty, coveringfact retrieval, complex reasoning, contextual summarization, and creative generation, and a systematic evaluation across the entire pipeline, from graph constructionand knowledge retrieval to final generation. Leveraging this novel benchmark, we systematically investigate the conditions when GraphRAG surpasses traditional RAG and the underlying reasons for its success, offering guidelines for its practical application.

| **[Magic Mushroom: A Customizable Benchmark for Fine-grained Analysis of Retrieval Noise Erosion in RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03901v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external retrieved information, mitigating issues such as hallucination and outdated knowledge. However, RAG systems are highly sensitive to retrieval noise prevalent in real-world scenarios. Existing benchmarks fail to emulate the complex and heterogeneous noise distributions encountered in real-world retrieval environments, undermining reliable robustness assessment. In this paper, we define four categories of retrieval noise based on linguistic properties and noise characteristics, aiming to reflect the heterogeneity of noise in real-world scenarios. Building on this, we introduce Magic Mushroom, a benchmark for replicating "magic mushroom" noise: contexts that appear relevant on the surface but covertly mislead RAG systems. Magic Mushroom comprises 7,468 single-hop and 3,925 multi-hop question-answer pairs. More importantly, Magic Mushroom enables researchers to flexibly configure combinations of retrieval noise according to specific research objectives or application scenarios, allowing for highly controlled evaluation setups. We evaluate LLM generators of varying parameter scales and classic RAG denoising strategies under diverse noise distributions to investigate their performance dynamics during progressive noise encroachment. Our analysis reveals that both generators and denoising strategies have significant room for improvement and exhibit extreme sensitivity to noise distributions. Magic Mushroom emerges as a promising tool for evaluating and advancing noise-robust RAG systems, accelerating their widespread deployment in real-world applications.
