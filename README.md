Recent advancements in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have further improved performance in System-2 reasoning domains like mathematics and programming by harnessing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to enhance the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, while longer CoT reasoning sequences improve performance, they also introduce significant computational overhead due to verbose and redundant outputs, known as the "overthinking phenomenon". In this paper, we provide the first structured survey to systematically investigate and explore the current progress toward achieving efficient reasoning in LLMs. Overall, relying on the inherent mechanism of LLMs, we categorize existing works into several key directions: (1) model-based efficient reasoning, which considers optimizing full-length reasoning models into more concise reasoning models or directly training efficient reasoning models; (2) reasoning output-based efficient reasoning, which aims to dynamically reduce reasoning steps and length during inference; (3) input prompts-based efficient reasoning, which seeks to enhance reasoning efficiency based on input prompt properties such as difficulty or length control. Additionally, we introduce the use of efficient data for training reasoning models, explore the reasoning capabilities of small language models, and discuss evaluation methods and benchmarking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Website: https://github.com/Eclipsess/Awesome-Efficient-Reasoning-LLMs</p></details> |
| **[The Emperor's New Clothes in Benchmarking? A Rigorous Examination of Mitigation Strategies for LLM Benchmark Data Contamination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16402v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benchmark Data Contamination (BDC)-the inclusion of benchmark testing samples in the training set-has raised increasing concerns in Large Language Model (LLM) evaluation, leading to falsely inflated performance estimates and undermining evaluation reliability. To address this, researchers have proposed various mitigation strategies to update existing benchmarks, including modifying original questions or generating new ones based on them. However, a rigorous examination of the effectiveness of these mitigation strategies remains lacking. In this paper, we design a systematic and controlled pipeline along with two novel metrics-fidelity and contamination resistance-to provide a fine-grained and comprehensive assessment of existing BDC mitigation strategies. Previous assessment methods, such as accuracy drop and accuracy matching, focus solely on aggregate accuracy, often leading to incomplete or misleading conclusions. Our metrics address this limitation by emphasizing question-level evaluation result matching. Extensive experiments with 10 LLMs, 5 benchmarks, 20 BDC mitigation strategies, and 2 contamination scenarios reveal that no existing strategy significantly improves resistance over the vanilla case (i.e., no benchmark update) across all benchmarks, and none effectively balances fidelity and contamination resistance. These findings underscore the urgent need for designing more effective BDC mitigation strategies.

| **[Exploring the Hidden Reasoning Process of Large Language Models by Misleading Them](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16401v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) and Vision language models (VLMs) have been able to perform various forms of reasoning tasks in a wide range of scenarios, but are they truly engaging in task abstraction and rule-based reasoning beyond mere memorization and pattern matching? To answer this question, we propose a novel experimental approach, Misleading Fine-Tuning (MisFT), to examine whether LLMs/VLMs perform abstract reasoning by altering their original understanding of fundamental rules. In particular, by constructing a dataset with math expressions that contradict correct operation principles, we fine-tune the model to learn those contradictory rules and assess its generalization ability on different test domains. Through a series of experiments, we find that current LLMs/VLMs are capable of effectively applying contradictory rules to solve practical math word problems and math expressions represented by images, implying the presence of an internal mechanism that abstracts before reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deconstructing Long Chain-of-Thought: A Structured Reasoning Optimization Framework for Long CoT Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16385v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities through long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. The R1 distillation scheme has emerged as a promising approach for training cost-effective models with enhanced reasoning abilities. However, the underlying mechanisms driving its effectiveness remain unclear. This study examines the universality of distillation data and identifies key components that enable the efficient transfer of long-chain reasoning capabilities in LLM distillation. Our findings reveal that the effectiveness of long CoT reasoning distillation from teacher models like Qwen-QwQ degrades significantly on nonhomologous models, challenging the assumed universality of current distillation methods. To gain deeper insights into the structure and patterns of long CoT reasoning, we propose DLCoT (Deconstructing Long Chain-of-Thought), a distillation data enhancement framework. DLCoT consists of three key steps: (1) data segmentation to decompose complex long CoT structures, (2) simplification by eliminating unsolvable and redundant solutions, and (3) optimization of intermediate error states. Our approach significantly improves model performance and token efficiency, facilitating the development of high-performance LLMs.</p></details> |  |

| **[Is Long Context All You Need? Leveraging LLM's Extended Context for NL2SQL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12372v5)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a range of natural language processing tasks. In particular, improvements in reasoning abilities and the expansion of context windows have opened new avenues for leveraging these powerful models. NL2SQL is challenging in that the natural language question is inherently ambiguous, while the SQL generation requires a precise understanding of complex data schema and semantics. One approach to this semantic ambiguous problem is to provide more and sufficient contextual information. In this work, we explore the performance and the latency trade-offs of the extended context window (a.k.a., long context) offered by Google's state-of-the-art LLM (\textit{gemini-1.5-pro}). We study the impact of various contextual information, including column example values, question and SQL query pairs, user-provided hints, SQL documentation, and schema. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study how the extended context window and extra contextual information can help NL2SQL generation with respect to both accuracy and latency cost. We show that long context LLMs are robust and do not get lost in the extended contextual information. Additionally, our long-context NL2SQL pipeline based on Google's \textit{gemini-pro-1.5} achieve strong performances on various benchmark datasets without finetuning and expensive self-consistency based techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, VLDB 2025</p></details> |
| **[LaPIG: Cross-Modal Generation of Paired Thermal and Visible Facial Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16376v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of modern machine learning, particularly in facial translation networks, is highly dependent on the availability of high-quality, paired, large-scale datasets. However, acquiring sufficient data is often challenging and costly. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models in high-quality image synthesis and advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a novel framework called LLM-assisted Paired Image Generation (LaPIG). This framework enables the construction of comprehensive, high-quality paired visible and thermal images using captions generated by LLMs. Our method encompasses three parts: visible image synthesis with ArcFace embedding, thermal image translation using Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), and caption generation with LLMs. Our approach not only generates multi-view paired visible and thermal images to increase data diversity but also produces high-quality paired data while maintaining their identity information. We evaluate our method on public datasets by comparing it with existing methods, demonstrating the superiority of LaPIG.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReLearn: Unlearning via Learning for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11190v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current unlearning methods for large language models usually rely on reverse optimization to reduce target token probabilities. However, this paradigm disrupts the subsequent tokens prediction, degrading model performance and linguistic coherence. Moreover, existing evaluation metrics overemphasize contextual forgetting while inadequately assessing response fluency and relevance. To address these challenges, we propose ReLearn, a data augmentation and fine-tuning pipeline for effective unlearning, along with a comprehensive evaluation framework. This framework introduces Knowledge Forgetting Rate (KFR) and Knowledge Retention Rate (KRR) to measure knowledge-level preservation, and Linguistic Score (LS) to evaluate generation quality. Our experiments show that ReLearn successfully achieves targeted forgetting while preserving high-quality output. Through mechanistic analysis, we further demonstrate how reverse optimization disrupts coherent text generation, while ReLearn preserves this essential capability.

| **[CaKE: Circuit-aware Editing Enables Generalizable Knowledge Learners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16356v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Editing (KE) enables the modification of outdated or incorrect information in large language models (LLMs). While existing KE methods can update isolated facts, they struggle to generalize these updates to multi-hop reasoning tasks that depend on the modified knowledge. Through an analysis of reasoning circuits -- the neural pathways LLMs use for knowledge-based inference, we observe that current layer-localized KE approaches, such as MEMIT and WISE, which edit only single or a few model layers, struggle to effectively incorporate updated information into these reasoning pathways. To address this limitation, we propose CaKE (Circuit-aware Knowledge Editing), a novel method that enables more effective integration of updated knowledge in LLMs. CaKE leverages strategically curated data, guided by our circuits-based analysis, that enforces the model to utilize the modified knowledge, stimulating the model to develop appropriate reasoning circuits for newly integrated knowledge. Experimental results show that CaKE enables more accurate and consistent use of updated knowledge across related reasoning tasks, leading to an average of 20% improvement in multi-hop reasoning accuracy on MQuAKE dataset compared to existing KE methods. We release the code and data in https://github.com/zjunlp/CaKE.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[LLM Braces: Straightening Out LLM Predictions with Relevant Sub-Updates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16334v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent findings reveal that much of the knowledge in a Transformer-based Large Language Model (LLM) is encoded in its feed-forward (FFN) layers, where each FNN layer can be interpreted as the summation of sub-updates, each corresponding to a weighted column vector from the FFN's value parameter matrix that often encodes human-interpretable concepts. In light of this, we hypothesize that model performance and behaviors can be further enhanced and controlled by modulating the contributions of these sub-updates based on their relevance to the input or target output style, and propose LLMBRACES, a novel and efficient method that computes relevance scores associated with value vectors in FFN layers and leverages these scores to dynamically adjust the contribution of sub-updates. By optimizing sub-update contributions, LLMBRACES refines the prediction process, leading to more accurate and reliable outputs, much like a 'brace' providing support and stability. Moreover, LLMBRACES can be extended to support conditional control over generation characteristics, such as sentiment, thereby offering fine-grained steering of LLM outputs. Extensive experiments on various LLMs-including Qwen2.5-1.5B, Llama2-7B, and Llama3-8B-demonstrate that LLMBRACES outperforms baseline approaches in both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings while requiring significantly fewer tunable parameters, up to 75% fewer compared to LoRA. Furthermore, LLMBRACES excels in sentiment-controlled generation and toxicity reduction, highlighting its potential for flexible, controlled text generation across applications.</p></details> | 16 pages, 2 figures |

The existing research on event coreference resolution is mostly limited to news articles. In this paper, we present the first dataset for the legal domain, LegalCore, which has been annotated with comprehensive event and event coreference information. The legal contract documents we annotated in this dataset are several times longer than news articles, with an average length of around 25k tokens per document. The annotations show that legal documents have dense event mentions and feature both short-distance and super long-distance coreference links between event mentions. We further benchmark mainstream Large Language Models (LLMs) on this dataset for both event detection and event coreference resolution tasks, and find that this dataset poses significant challenges for state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs, which perform significantly worse than a supervised baseline. We will publish the dataset as well as the code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Need ...</summary><p>Need company internal approval before public release</p></details> |
| **[OmniGeo: Towards a Multimodal Large Language Models for Geospatial Artificial Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16326v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models (LLMs) has opened new frontiers in artificial intelligence, enabling the integration of diverse large-scale data types such as text, images, and spatial information. In this paper, we explore the potential of multimodal LLMs (MLLM) for geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI), a field that leverages spatial data to address challenges in domains including Geospatial Semantics, Health Geography, Urban Geography, Urban Perception, and Remote Sensing. We propose a MLLM (OmniGeo) tailored to geospatial applications, capable of processing and analyzing heterogeneous data sources, including satellite imagery, geospatial metadata, and textual descriptions. By combining the strengths of natural language understanding and spatial reasoning, our model enhances the ability of instruction following and the accuracy of GeoAI systems. Results demonstrate that our model outperforms task-specific models and existing LLMs on diverse geospatial tasks, effectively addressing the multimodality nature while achieving competitive results on the zero-shot geospatial tasks. Our code will be released after publication.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, Under review</p></details> |
| **[LLM-SR: Scientific Equation Discovery via Programming with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18400v3)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mathematical equations have been unreasonably effective in describing complex natural phenomena across various scientific disciplines. However, discovering such insightful equations from data presents significant challenges due to the necessity of navigating extremely large combinatorial hypothesis spaces. Current methods of equation discovery, commonly known as symbolic regression techniques, largely focus on extracting equations from data alone, often neglecting the domain-specific prior knowledge that scientists typically depend on. They also employ limited representations such as expression trees, constraining the search space and expressiveness of equations. To bridge this gap, we introduce LLM-SR, a novel approach that leverages the extensive scientific knowledge and robust code generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to discover scientific equations from data. Specifically, LLM-SR treats equations as programs with mathematical operators and combines LLMs' scientific priors with evolutionary search over equation programs. The LLM iteratively proposes new equation skeleton hypotheses, drawing from its domain knowledge, which are then optimized against data to estimate parameters. We evaluate LLM-SR on four benchmark problems across diverse scientific domains (e.g., physics, biology), which we carefully designed to simulate the discovery process and prevent LLM recitation. Our results demonstrate that LLM-SR discovers physically accurate equations that significantly outperform state-of-the-art symbolic regression baselines, particularly in out-of-domain test settings. We also show that LLM-SR's incorporation of scientific priors enables more efficient equation space exploration than the baselines.

LLMs have a wide range of application value in the field of humanities and social sciences because of its strong text understanding, generation and reasoning capabilities. In humanities and social sciences research, LLMs can analyze large-scale text data and make inferences. This article analyzes the large language model DeepSeek-R1 from seven aspects: low-resource language translation, educational question-answering, student writing improvement in higher education, logical reasoning, educational measurement and psychometrics, public health policy analysis, and art education.Then we compare the answers given by DeepSeek-R1 in the seven aspects with the answers given by o1-preview. DeepSeek-R1 performs well in the humanities and social sciences, answering most questions correctly and logically, and can give reasonable analysis processes and explanations. Compared with o1-preview, it can automatically generate reasoning processes and provide more detailed explanations, which is suitable for beginners or people who need to have a detailed understanding of this knowledge, while o1-preview is more suitable for quick reading. Through analysis, it is found that LLM has broad application potential in the field of humanities and social sciences, and shows great advantages in improving text analysis efficiency, language communication and other fields. LLM's powerful language understanding and generation capabilities enable it to deeply explore complex problems in the field of humanities and social sciences, and provide innovative tools for academic research and practical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2409.18486</p></details> |
| **[When Text Embedding Meets Large Language Model: A Comprehensive Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09165v3)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text embedding has become a foundational technology in natural language processing (NLP) during the deep learning era, driving advancements across a wide array of downstream tasks. While many natural language understanding challenges can now be modeled using generative paradigms and leverage the robust generative and comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs), numerous practical applications - such as semantic matching, clustering, and information retrieval - continue to rely on text embeddings for their efficiency and effectiveness. Therefore, integrating LLMs with text embeddings has become a major research focus in recent years. In this survey, we categorize the interplay between LLMs and text embeddings into three overarching themes: (1) LLM-augmented text embedding, enhancing traditional embedding methods with LLMs; (2) LLMs as text embedders, adapting their innate capabilities for high-quality embedding; and (3) Text embedding understanding with LLMs, leveraging LLMs to analyze and interpret embeddings. By organizing recent works based on interaction patterns rather than specific downstream applications, we offer a novel and systematic overview of contributions from various research and application domains in the era of LLMs. Furthermore, we highlight the unresolved challenges that persisted in the pre-LLM era with pre-trained language models (PLMs) and explore the emerging obstacles brought forth by LLMs. Building on this analysis, we outline prospective directions for the evolution of text embedding, addressing both theoretical and practical opportunities in the rapidly advancing landscape of NLP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Versi...</summary><p>Version 3: We added some latest works of LLM-based Embedders and MLLM-based Embedders</p></details> |
| **[Immune: Improving Safety Against Jailbreaks in Multi-modal LLMs via Inference-Time Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18688v3)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread deployment of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for visual-reasoning tasks, improving their safety has become crucial. Recent research indicates that despite training-time safety alignment, these models remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. In this work, we first highlight an important safety gap to describe that alignment achieved solely through safety training may be insufficient against jailbreak attacks. To address this vulnerability, we propose Immune, an inference-time defense framework that leverages a safe reward model through controlled decoding to defend against jailbreak attacks. Additionally, we provide a mathematical characterization of Immune, offering insights on why it improves safety against jailbreaks. Extensive evaluations on diverse jailbreak benchmarks using recent MLLMs reveal that Immune effectively enhances model safety while preserving the model's original capabilities. For instance, against text-based jailbreak attacks on LLaVA-1.6, Immune reduces the attack success rate by 57.82% and 16.78% compared to the base MLLM and state-of-the-art defense strategy, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Uni-3DAR: Unified 3D Generation and Understanding via Autoregression on Compressed Spatial Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16278v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models and their multi-modal extensions have demonstrated the effectiveness of unifying generation and understanding through autoregressive next-token prediction. However, despite the critical role of 3D structural generation and understanding ({3D GU}) in AI for science, these tasks have largely evolved independently, with autoregressive methods remaining underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce Uni-3DAR, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates {3D GU} tasks via autoregressive prediction. At its core, Uni-3DAR employs a novel hierarchical tokenization that compresses 3D space using an octree, leveraging the inherent sparsity of 3D structures. It then applies an additional tokenization for fine-grained structural details, capturing key attributes such as atom types and precise spatial coordinates in microscopic 3D structures. We further propose two optimizations to enhance efficiency and effectiveness. The first is a two-level subtree compression strategy, which reduces the octree token sequence by up to 8x. The second is a masked next-token prediction mechanism tailored for dynamically varying token positions, significantly boosting model performance. By combining these strategies, Uni-3DAR successfully unifies diverse {3D GU} tasks within a single autoregressive framework. Extensive experiments across multiple microscopic {3D GU} tasks, including molecules, proteins, polymers, and crystals, validate its effectiveness and versatility. Notably, Uni-3DAR surpasses previous state-of-the-art diffusion models by a substantial margin, achieving up to 256\% relative improvement while delivering inference speeds up to 21.8x faster. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/dptech-corp/Uni-3DAR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain of Functions: A Programmatic Pipeline for Fine-Grained Chart Reasoning Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16260v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual reasoning is crucial for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to address complex chart queries, yet high-quality rationale data remains scarce. Existing methods leveraged (M)LLMs for data generation, but direct prompting often yields limited precision and diversity. In this paper, we propose \textit{Chain of Functions (CoF)}, a novel programmatic reasoning data generation pipeline that utilizes freely-explored reasoning paths as supervision to ensure data precision and diversity. Specifically, it starts with human-free exploration among the atomic functions (e.g., maximum data and arithmetic operations) to generate diverse function chains, which are then translated into linguistic rationales and questions with only a moderate open-sourced LLM. \textit{CoF} provides multiple benefits: 1) Precision: function-governed generation reduces hallucinations compared to freeform generation; 2) Diversity: enumerating function chains enables varied question taxonomies; 3) Explainability: function chains serve as built-in rationales, allowing fine-grained evaluation beyond overall accuracy; 4) Practicality: eliminating reliance on extremely large models. Employing \textit{CoF}, we construct the \textit{ChartCoF} dataset, with 1.4k complex reasoning Q\&A for fine-grained analysis and 50k Q\&A for reasoning enhancement. The fine-grained evaluation on \textit{ChartCoF} reveals varying performance across question taxonomies for each MLLM, and the experiments also show that finetuning with \textit{ChartCoF} achieves state-of-the-art performance among same-scale MLLMs on widely used benchmarks. Furthermore, the novel paradigm of function-governed rationale generation in \textit{CoF} could inspire broader applications beyond charts.</p></details> | Under review |

However, due to the thousands of visual tokens from the video frames, key-value (KV) cache can significantly increase memory requirements, becoming a bottleneck for inference speed and memory usage. KV cache quantization is a widely used approach to address this problem. In this paper, we find that 2-bit KV quantization of VideoLLMs can hardly hurt the model performance, while the limit of KV cache quantization in even lower bits has not been investigated. To bridge this gap, we introduce VidKV, a plug-and-play KV cache quantization method to compress the KV cache to lower than 2 bits. Specifically, (1) for key, we propose a mixed-precision quantization strategy in the channel dimension, where we perform 2-bit quantization for anomalous channels and 1-bit quantization combined with FFT for normal channels; (2) for value, we implement 1.58-bit quantization while selectively filtering semantically salient visual tokens for targeted preservation, for a better trade-off between precision and model performance. Importantly, our findings suggest that the value cache of VideoLLMs should be quantized in a per-channel fashion instead of the per-token fashion proposed by prior KV cache quantization works for LLMs. Empirically, extensive results with LLaVA-OV-7B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B on six benchmarks show that VidKV effectively compresses the KV cache to 1.5-bit and 1.58-bit precision with almost no performance drop compared to the FP16 counterparts.</p></details> | 12 pages |

While research has documented how these models perpetuate stereotypes across demographic groups, most work has focused on between-group biases rather than within-group differences. This study investigates homogeneity bias-the tendency to portray groups as more uniform than they are-within Black Americans, examining how perceived racial phenotypicality influences VLMs' outputs. Using computer-generated images that systematically vary in phenotypicality, we prompted VLMs to generate stories about these individuals and measured text similarity to assess content homogeneity. Our findings reveal three key patterns: First, VLMs generate significantly more homogeneous stories about Black individuals with higher phenotypicality compared to those with lower phenotypicality. Second, stories about Black women consistently display greater homogeneity than those about Black men across all models tested. Third, in two of three VLMs, this homogeneity bias is primarily driven by a pronounced interaction where phenotypicality strongly influences content variation for Black women but has minimal impact for Black men. These results demonstrate how intersectionality shapes AI-generated representations and highlight the persistence of stereotyping that mirror documented biases in human perception, where increased racial phenotypicality leads to greater stereotyping and less individualized representation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Large Language Models for Handwritten Text Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15195v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional machine learning models for Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) rely on supervised training, requiring extensive manual annotations, and often produce errors due to the separation between layout and text processing. In contrast, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a general approach to recognizing diverse handwriting styles without the need for model-specific training. The study benchmarks various proprietary and open-source LLMs against Transkribus models, evaluating their performance on both modern and historical datasets written in English, French, German, and Italian. In addition, emphasis is placed on testing the models' ability to autonomously correct previously generated outputs. Findings indicate that proprietary models, especially Claude 3.5 Sonnet, outperform open-source alternatives in zero-shot settings. MLLMs achieve excellent results in recognizing modern handwriting and exhibit a preference for the English language due to their pre-training dataset composition. Comparisons with Transkribus show no consistent advantage for either approach. Moreover, LLMs demonstrate limited ability to autonomously correct errors in zero-shot transcriptions.</p></details> |  |

However, their capabilities in handling complex financial tasks still require in-depth exploration. In this paper, we introduce Fin-R1, a reasoning large language model specifically designed for the financial sector. Fin-R1 is built using a two-stage architecture, leveraging a financial reasoning dataset distilled and processed based on DeepSeek-R1. Through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) training, it demonstrates performance close to DeepSeek-R1 with a parameter size of 7 billion across a range of financial reasoning tasks. It achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in the FinQA and ConvFinQA tasks between those LLMs in our evaluation, surpassing larger models in other tasks as well. Fin-R1 showcases strong reasoning and decision-making capabilities, providing solutions to various problems encountered in the financial domain.

While these tools can help people by generating ideas or producing higher quality work, like many other AI tools they may risk causing a variety of harms, disproportionately burdening historically marginalized groups. In this work, we introduce and evaluate perceptual harm, a term for the harm caused to users when others perceive or suspect them of using AI. We examined perceptual harms in three online experiments, each of which entailed human participants evaluating the profiles for fictional freelance writers. We asked participants whether they suspected the freelancers of using AI, the quality of their writing, and whether they should be hired. We found some support for perceptual harms against for certain demographic groups, but that perceptions of AI use negatively impacted writing evaluations and hiring outcomes across the board.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, health coaching offers highly personalized support but can be prohibitively expensive and inaccessible. This study draws inspiration from health coaching to explore how large language models (LLMs) might address personalization challenges in mobile health. We conduct formative interviews with 12 health professionals and 10 potential coaching recipients to develop design principles for an LLM-based health coach. We then built GPTCoach, a chatbot that implements the onboarding conversation from an evidence-based coaching program, uses conversational strategies from motivational interviewing, and incorporates wearable data to create personalized physical activity plans. In a lab study with 16 participants using three months of historical data, we find promising evidence that GPTCoach gathers rich qualitative information to offer personalized support, with users feeling comfortable sharing concerns. We conclude with implications for future research on LLM-based physical activity support.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pleas...</summary><p>Please note that the title has been updated from a previous pre-print (previously: "Supporting Physical Activity Behavior Change with LLM-Based Conversational Agents")</p></details> |

Discoverable extraction is the most common method for measuring this issue: split a training example into a prefix and suffix, then prompt the LLM with the prefix, and deem the example extractable if the LLM generates the matching suffix using greedy sampling. This definition yields a yes-or-no determination of whether extraction was successful with respect to a single query. Though efficient to compute, we show that this definition is unreliable because it does not account for non-determinism present in more realistic (non-greedy) sampling schemes, for which LLMs produce a range of outputs for the same prompt. We introduce probabilistic discoverable extraction, which, without additional cost, relaxes discoverable extraction by considering multiple queries to quantify the probability of extracting a target sequence. We evaluate our probabilistic measure across different models, sampling schemes, and training-data repetitions, and find that this measure provides more nuanced information about extraction risk compared to traditional discoverable extraction.</p></details> | NAACL 25 |

Yet, without vast amounts of spatial supervision, current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle at this task. In this paper, we introduce TWIST & SCOUT, a framework that equips pre-trained MLLMs with visual grounding ability without forgetting their existing image and language understanding skills. To this end, we propose TWIST, a twin-expert stepwise tuning module that modifies the decoder of the language model using one frozen module pre-trained on image understanding tasks and another learnable one for visual grounding tasks. This allows the MLLM to retain previously learned knowledge and skills, while acquiring what is missing. To fine-tune the model effectively, we generate a high-quality synthetic dataset we call SCOUT, which mimics human reasoning in visual grounding. This dataset provides rich supervision signals, describing a step-by-step multimodal reasoning process, thereby simplifying the task of visual grounding. We evaluate our approach on several standard benchmark datasets, encompassing grounded image captioning, zero-shot localization, and visual grounding tasks. Our method consistently delivers strong performance across all tasks, while retaining the pre-trained image understanding capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Defending against such attacks remains challenging due to the opacity of jailbreaking mechanisms and the high computational cost of training LLMs robustly. We demonstrate that adversarial attacks share a universal mechanism for circumventing LLM safeguards that works by ablating a dimension in the residual stream embedding space called the refusal feature. We further show that the operation of refusal feature ablation (RFA) approximates the worst-case perturbation of offsetting model safety. Based on these findings, we propose Refusal Feature Adversarial Training (ReFAT), a novel algorithm that efficiently performs LLM adversarial training by simulating the effect of input-level attacks via RFA. Experiment results show that ReFAT significantly improves the robustness of three popular LLMs against a wide range of adversarial attacks, with considerably less computational overhead compared to existing adversarial training methods.</p></details> |  |

Our study investigates the potential of reinforcement learning (RL) to improve reasoning in small LLMs, focusing on a 1.5-billion-parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, under strict constraints: training on 4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs (48 GB VRAM each) within 24 hours. Adapting the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and curating a compact, high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset, we conducted three experiments to explore model behavior and performance. Our results demonstrate rapid reasoning gains - e.g., AMC23 accuracy rising from 63% to 80% and AIME24 reaching 46.7%, surpassing o1-preview - using only 7,000 samples and a $42 training cost, compared to thousands of dollars for baseline models. However, challenges such as optimization instability and length constraints emerged with prolonged training. These findings highlight the efficacy of RL-based fine-tuning for small LLMs, offering a cost-effective alternative to large-scale approaches. We release our code and datasets as open-source resources, providing insights into trade-offs and laying a foundation for scalable, reasoning-capable LLMs in resource-limited environments.

These varieties can affect the performance of natural language processing (NLP) models, including large language models (LLMs), which are often trained on data from widely spoken varieties. This paper introduces a novel and cost-effective approach to benchmark model performance across language varieties. We argue that international online review platforms, such as Booking.com, can serve as effective data sources for constructing datasets that capture comments in different language varieties from similar real-world scenarios, like reviews for the same hotel with the same rating using the same language (e.g., Mandarin Chinese) but different language varieties (e.g., Taiwan Mandarin, Mainland Mandarin). To prove this concept, we constructed a contextually aligned dataset comprising reviews in Taiwan Mandarin and Mainland Mandarin and tested six LLMs in a sentiment analysis task. Our results show that LLMs consistently underperform in Taiwan Mandarin.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 Annual Conference of the Nations of the Americas Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL), theme track</p></details> |

While data augmentation is promising to enhance mathematical problem-solving ability, current approaches are predominantly limited to instance-level modifications-such as rephrasing or generating syntactic variations-which fail to capture and leverage the intrinsic relational structures inherent in mathematical knowledge. Inspired by human learning processes, where mathematical proficiency develops through systematic exposure to interconnected concepts, we introduce MathFusion, a novel framework that enhances mathematical reasoning through cross-problem instruction synthesis. MathFusion implements this through three fusion strategies: (1) sequential fusion, which chains related problems to model solution dependencies; (2) parallel fusion, which combines analogous problems to reinforce conceptual understanding; and (3) conditional fusion, which creates context-aware selective problems to enhance reasoning flexibility. By applying these strategies, we generate a new dataset, \textbf{MathFusionQA}, followed by fine-tuning models (DeepSeekMath-7B, Mistral-7B, Llama3-8B) on it. Experimental results demonstrate that MathFusion achieves substantial improvements in mathematical reasoning while maintaining high data efficiency, boosting performance by 18.0 points in accuracy across diverse benchmarks while requiring only 45K additional synthetic instructions, representing a substantial improvement over traditional single-instruction approaches. Our datasets, models, and code are publicly available at https://github.com/QizhiPei/mathfusion.</p></details> | Work in progress |

While increasing parameter counts improves accuracy, it also broadens the gap between state-of-the-art capabilities and practical deployability. We present Puzzle, a hardware-aware framework that accelerates the inference of LLMs while preserving their capabilities. Using neural architecture search (NAS) at a large-scale, Puzzle optimizes models with tens of billions of parameters. Our approach utilizes blockwise local knowledge distillation (BLD) for parallel architecture exploration and employs mixed-integer programming for precise constraint optimization. We showcase our framework's impact via Llama-3.1-Nemotron-51B-Instruct (Nemotron-51B), a publicly available model derived from Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct. Nemotron-51B achieves a 2.17x inference throughput speedup, fitting on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU while retaining 98.4% of the original model's benchmark accuracies. Notably, it is the most accurate model supporting single H100 GPU inference with large batch sizes, despite training on only 45B tokens, far fewer than the 15T used to train Llama-70B. Lastly, we derive Llama-3.3-Nemotron-49B-Super-Base to demonstrate Puzzle can retain long-context and that lightweight alignment on these derived models allows them to surpass the parent model in specific capabilities. Our work establishes that powerful LLM models can be optimized for efficient deployment with only negligible loss in quality, underscoring that inference performance, not parameter count alone, should guide model selection.</p></details> |  |

This research aims to evaluate the guardrail effectiveness of GPT-4o, Grok-2 Beta, Llama 3.1 (405B), Gemini 1.5, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet through black-box testing of seemingly ethical multi-step jailbreak prompts. It conducts ethical attacks by designing an identical multi-step prompts that simulates the scenario of "corporate middle managers competing for promotions." The data results show that the guardrails of the above-mentioned LLMs were bypassed and the content of verbal attacks was generated. Claude 3.5 Sonnet's resistance to multi-step jailbreak prompts is more obvious. To ensure objectivity, the experimental process, black box test code, and enhanced guardrail code are uploaded to the GitHub repository: https://github.com/brucewang123456789/GeniusTrail.git.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to Nature Machine Intelligence and OpenReview preprints.

Analyzing over 25,000 tweets and employing large language models (LLMs) for sentiment and political classification, we distinguish between positive partisanship (support of allies) and negative partisanship (criticism of opponents). Our findings are contingent on the definition of the in-group. When political in-groups are defined at the ideological bloc level, negative and positive partisanship occur at similar rates. However, when the in-group is defined at the party level, negative partisanship becomes significantly more dominant and is 1.51 times more likely (1.45, 1.58). This effect is even stronger among extreme politicians, who engage in negativity more than their moderate counterparts. Negative partisanship also proves to be a strategic choice for online visibility, attracting 3.18 more likes and 1.69 more retweets on average. By adapting methods developed for two-party systems and leveraging LLMs for Swedish-language analysis, we provide novel insights into how multiparty politics shapes polarizing discourse. Our results underscore both the strategic appeal of negativity in digital spaces and the growing potential of LLMs for large-scale, non-English political research.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 fig...</summary><p>5 figures, 4 tables, 26 pages</p></details> |

These models are continually improving due to computational advancements, leading to better decision-making and more efficient WDS management. However, the significant time and effort required for modeling, programming, and analyzing results remain substantial challenges. Another issue is the professional burden, which confines the interaction with models, databases, and other sophisticated tools to a small group of experts, thereby causing non-technical stakeholders to depend on these experts or make decisions without modeling support. Furthermore, explaining model results is challenging even for experts, as it is often unclear which conditions cause the model to reach a certain state or recommend a specific policy. The recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) open doors for a new stage in human-model interaction. This study proposes a framework of plain language interactions with hydraulic and water quality models based on LLM-EPANET architecture. This framework is tested with increasing levels of complexity of queries to study the ability of LLMs to interact with WDS models, run complex simulations, and report simulation results. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated across several categories of queries and hyper-parameter configurations, demonstrating its potential to enhance decision-making processes in WDS management.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EWRI Congress 2025</p></details> |
| **[CLS-RL: Image Classification with Rule-Based Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16188v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classification is a core task in machine learning. Recent research has shown that although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are initially poor at image classification, fine-tuning them with an adequate amount of data can significantly enhance their performance, making them comparable to SOTA classification models. However, acquiring large-scale labeled data is expensive. In this paper, we explore few-shot MLLM classification fine-tuning. We found that SFT can cause severe overfitting issues and may even degrade performance over the zero-shot approach. To address this challenge, inspired by the recent successes in rule-based reinforcement learning, we propose CLS-RL, which uses verifiable signals as reward to fine-tune MLLMs. We discovered that CLS-RL outperforms SFT in most datasets and has a much higher average accuracy on both base-to-new and few-shot learning setting. Moreover, we observed a free-lunch phenomenon for CLS-RL; when models are fine-tuned on a particular dataset, their performance on other distinct datasets may also improve over zero-shot models, even if those datasets differ in distribution and class names. This suggests that RL-based methods effectively teach models the fundamentals of classification. Lastly, inspired by recent works in inference time thinking, we re-examine the `thinking process' during fine-tuning, a critical aspect of RL-based methods, in the context of visual classification. We question whether such tasks require extensive thinking process during fine-tuning, proposing that this may actually detract from performance. Based on this premise, we introduce the No-Thinking-CLS-RL method, which minimizes thinking processes during training by setting an equality accuracy reward. Our findings indicate that, with much less fine-tuning time, No-Thinking-CLS-RL method achieves superior in-domain performance and generalization capabilities than CLS-RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, work in progress</p></details> |

This paper addresses a key aspect in the design of such agents: predicting human decisions in off-policy evaluation (OPE). We focus on language-based persuasion games, where an expert aims to influence the decision-maker through verbal messages. In our OPE framework, the prediction model is trained on human interaction data collected from encounters with one set of expert agents, and its performance is evaluated on interactions with a different set of experts. Using a dedicated application, we collected a dataset of 87K decisions from humans playing a repeated decision-making game with artificial agents. To enhance off-policy performance, we propose a simulation technique involving interactions across the entire agent space and simulated decision-makers. Our learning strategy yields significant OPE gains, e.g., improving prediction accuracy in the top 15% challenging cases by 7.1%. Our code and the large dataset we collected and generated are submitted as supplementary material and publicly available in our GitHub repository: https://github.com/eilamshapira/HumanChoicePrediction</p></details> |  |

Notable recent examples arise in preference alignment for large language models, including in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO). For many applications of preference alignment, the cost of acquiring human feedback can be substantial. In this work, we take advantage of the fact that one can often choose contexts at which to obtain human feedback to most efficiently identify a good policy, and formalize the setting as an active contextual dueling bandit problem. We propose an active exploration algorithm to efficiently select the data and provide theoretical proof that it has a polynomial worst-case regret bound. We extend the setting and methodology for practical use in preference alignment of large language models. We provide two extensions, an online and an offline approach. Our method outperforms the baselines with limited samples of human preferences on several language models and four real-world datasets including two new datasets that we contribute to the literature.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeReviewQA: The Code Review Comprehension Assessment for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16167v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive code generation capabilities but struggle with real-world software engineering tasks, such as revising source code to address code reviews, hindering their practical use. Code review comments are often implicit, ambiguous, and colloquial, requiring models to grasp both code and human intent. This challenge calls for evaluating large language models' ability to bridge both technical and conversational contexts. While existing work has employed the automated code refinement (ACR) task to resolve these comments, current evaluation methods fall short, relying on text matching metrics that provide limited insight into model failures and remain susceptible to training data contamination. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel evaluation benchmark, $\textbf{CodeReviewQA}$ that enables us to conduct fine-grained assessment of model capabilities and mitigate data contamination risks. In CodeReviewQA, we decompose the generation task of code refinement into $\textbf{three essential reasoning steps}$: $\textit{change type recognition}$ (CTR), $\textit{change localisation}$ (CL), and $\textit{solution identification}$ (SI). Each step is reformulated as multiple-choice questions with varied difficulty levels, enabling precise assessment of model capabilities, while mitigating data contamination risks. Our comprehensive evaluation spans 72 recently released large language models on $\textbf{900 manually curated, high-quality examples}$ across nine programming languages. Our results show that CodeReviewQA is able to expose specific model weaknesses in code review comprehension, disentangled from their generative automated code refinement results.</p></details> |  |

Existing KV cache compression methods include eviction, merging, or quantization of the KV cache to reduce its size. However, compression results in irreversible information forgetting, potentially affecting the accuracy of subsequent decoding. In this paper, we propose SpeCache, which takes full advantage of the large and easily expandable CPU memory to offload the complete KV cache, and dynamically fetches KV pairs back in each decoding step based on their importance measured by low-bit KV cache copy in VRAM. To avoid inference latency caused by CPU-GPU communication, SpeCache speculatively predicts the KV pairs that the next token might attend to, allowing us to prefetch them before the next decoding step which enables parallelization of prefetching and computation. Experiments on LongBench and Needle-in-a-Haystack benchmarks verify that SpeCache effectively reduces VRAM usage while avoiding information forgetting for long sequences without re-training, even with a 10x high KV cache compression ratio.</p></details> |  |

At the same time, they offer a new way of accessing information, mainly through the RAG framework. While there have been notable improvements for the autoregressive models, overcoming hallucination in the generated answers remains a continuous problem. A standard solution is to use commercial LLMs, such as GPT4, to evaluate these algorithms. However, such frameworks are expensive and not very transparent. Therefore, we propose a study which demonstrates the interest of open-weight models for evaluating RAG hallucination. We develop a lightweight approach using smaller, quantized LLMs to provide an accessible and interpretable metric that gives continuous scores for the generated answer with respect to their correctness and faithfulness. This score allows us to question decisions' reliability and explore thresholds to develop a new AUC metric as an alternative to correlation with human judgment.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 5 figures, published at 1st workshop of Quantify Uncertainty and Hallucination in Foundation Models: The Next Frontier in Reliable AI at ICLR 25</p></details> |

Recent studies have proposed emotion-related datasets, frameworks and models to automatically evaluate MT quality of Chinese UGC, without relying on reference translations. However, whether these models are robust to the challenge of preserving emotional nuances has been left largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel method inspired by information theory which generates challenging Chinese homophone words related to emotions, by leveraging the concept of self-information. Our approach generates homophones that were observed to cause translation errors in emotion preservation, and exposes vulnerabilities in MT systems and their evaluation methods when tackling emotional UGC. We evaluate the efficacy of our method using human evaluation for the quality of these generated homophones, and compare it with an existing one, showing that our method achieves higher correlation with human judgments. The generated Chinese homophones, along with their manual translations, are utilized to generate perturbations and to probe the robustness of existing quality evaluation models, including models trained using multi-task learning, fine-tuned variants of multilingual language models, as well as large language models (LLMs). Our results indicate that LLMs with larger size exhibit higher stability and robustness to such perturbations. We release our data and code for reproducibility and further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 10th Workshop on Noisy and User-generated Text at NAACL 2025</p></details> |

For all of these applications and others, political biases in these models can affect their performance. Several researchers have attempted to study political bias in language models using evaluation suites based on surveys, such as the Political Compass Test (PCT), often finding a particular leaning favored by these models. However, there is some variation in the exact prompting techniques, leading to diverging findings and most research relies on constrained-answer settings to extract model responses. Moreover, the Political Compass Test is not a scientifically valid survey instrument. In this work, we contribute a political bias measured informed by political science theory, building on survey design principles to test a wide variety of input prompts, while taking into account prompt sensitivity. We then prompt 11 different open and commercial models, differentiating between instruction-tuned and non-instruction-tuned models, and automatically classify their political stances from 88,110 responses. Leveraging this dataset, we compute political bias profiles across different prompt variations and find that while PCT exaggerates bias in certain models like GPT3.5, measures of political bias are often unstable, but generally more left-leaning for instruction-tuned models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unify and Triumph: Polyglot, Diverse, and Self-Consistent Generation of Unit Tests with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16144v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM)-based test generation has gained attention in software engineering, yet most studies evaluate LLMs' ability to generate unit tests in a single attempt for a given language, missing the opportunity to leverage LLM diversity for more robust testing. This paper introduces PolyTest, a novel approach that enhances test generation by exploiting polyglot and temperature-controlled diversity. PolyTest systematically leverages these properties in two complementary ways: (1) Cross-lingual test generation, where tests are generated in multiple languages at zero temperature and then unified; (2) Diverse test sampling, where multiple test sets are generated within the same language at a higher temperature before unification. A key insight is that LLMs can generate diverse yet contradicting tests -- same input, different expected outputs -- across languages and generations. PolyTest mitigates inconsistencies by unifying test sets, fostering self-consistency and improving overall test quality. Unlike single-language or single-attempt approaches, PolyTest enhances testing without requiring on-the-fly execution, making it particularly beneficial for weaker-performing languages. We evaluate PolyTest on Llama3-70B, GPT-4o, and GPT-3.5 using EvalPlus, generating tests in five languages (Java, C, Python, JavaScript, and a CSV-based format) at temperature 0 and sampling multiple sets at temperature 1. We observe that LLMs frequently generate contradicting tests across settings, and that PolyTest significantly improves test quality across all considered metrics -- number of tests, passing rate, statement/branch coverage (up to +9.01%), and mutation score (up to +11.23%). Finally, PolyTest outperforms Pynguin in test generation, passing rate, and mutation score.</p></details> |  |

These rationales consist of intermediate SQL statements and explanations, serving as incremental steps toward constructing the final SQL query. The process begins with manually annotating a small set of examples, which are then used to prompt a large language model in an iterative, dynamic few-shot knowledge distillation procedure from a teacher model. A rationalization model is subsequently trained on the validated decomposed queries, enabling extensive synthetic CoT annotations for text-to-SQL datasets. To evaluate the approach, we fine-tune small language models with and without these rationales on the BIRD dataset. Results indicate that step-by-step query generation improves execution accuracy, especially for moderately and highly complex queries, while also enhancing explainability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025 Workshop on Reasoning and Planning for LLMs</p></details> |

Such reframing is typically non-trivial and requires multiple rationalization steps to uncover the underlying issue of a negative thought and transform it to be more positive. However, this rationalization process is currently neglected by both datasets and models which reframe thoughts in one step. In this work, we address this gap by augmenting open-source datasets for positive text rewriting with synthetically-generated Socratic rationales using a novel framework called \textsc{SocraticReframe}. SocraticReframe uses a sequence of question-answer pairs to rationalize the thought rewriting process. We show that such Socratic rationales significantly improve positive text rewriting for different open-source LLMs according to both automatic and human evaluations guided by criteria from psychotherapy research. We validate our framework and the synthetic rationalizations with expert judgements from domain experts and psychology students in an IRB-approved annotation study. Our findings highlight the potential of utilizing the synergy between LLM reasoning and established psychotherapy techniques to build assistive solutions for reframing negative thoughts.</p></details> |  |

To address this critical language gap in medical QA, we propose Multilingual Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval Ranking (MKG-Rank), a knowledge graph-enhanced framework that enables English-centric LLMs to perform multilingual medical QA. Through a word-level translation mechanism, our framework efficiently integrates comprehensive English-centric medical knowledge graphs into LLM reasoning at a low cost, mitigating cross-lingual semantic distortion and achieving precise medical QA across language barriers. To enhance efficiency, we introduce caching and multi-angle ranking strategies to optimize the retrieval process, significantly reducing response times and prioritizing relevant medical knowledge. Extensive evaluations on multilingual medical QA benchmarks across Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Swahili demonstrate that MKG-Rank consistently outperforms zero-shot LLMs, achieving maximum 33.89% increase in accuracy, while maintaining an average retrieval time of only 0.0009 seconds.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bring Remote Sensing Object Detect Into Nature Language Model: Using SFT Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08144v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved significant success, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in understanding various images and videos, particularly in classification and detection tasks. However, due to the substantial differences between remote sensing images and conventional optical images, these models face considerable challenges in comprehension, especially in detection tasks. Directly prompting VLMs with detection instructions often leads to unsatisfactory results. To address this issue, this letter explores the application of VLMs for object detection in remote sensing images. Specifically, we constructed supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets using publicly available remote sensing object detection datasets, including SSDD, HRSID, and NWPU-VHR-10. In these new datasets, we converted annotation information into JSON-compliant natural language descriptions, facilitating more effective understanding and training for the VLM. We then evaluate the detection performance of various fine-tuning strategies for VLMs and derive optimized model weights for object detection in remote sensing images. Finally, we evaluate the model's prior knowledge capabilities using natural language queries. Experimental results demonstrate that, without modifying the model architecture, remote sensing object detection can be effectively achieved using natural language alone. Additionally, the model exhibits the ability to perform certain vision question answering (VQA) tasks. Our datasets and related code will be released soon.</p></details> |  |

This design choice can obscure the probabilistic and predictive nature of these models, potentially fostering undue trust and over-anthropomorphization of the underlying model. In this paper, we investigate (i) the effect of displaying multiple responses simultaneously as a countermeasure to these issues, and (ii) how a cognitive support mechanism-highlighting structural and semantic similarities across responses-helps users deal with the increased cognitive load of that intervention. We conducted a within-subjects study in which participants inspected responses generated by an LLM under three conditions: one response, ten responses with cognitive support, and ten responses without cognitive support. Participants then answered questions about workload, trust and reliance, and anthropomorphization. We conclude by reporting the results of these studies and discussing future work and design opportunities for future LLM interfaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and presented at Trust and Reliance in Evolving Human-AI Workflows (TREW) Workshop, CHI 2024</p></details> |
| **[Cultural Alignment in Large Language Models Using Soft Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16094v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) alignment conventionally relies on supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning based alignment frameworks. These methods typically require labeled or preference datasets and involve updating model weights to align the LLM with the training objective or reward model. Meanwhile, in social sciences such as cross-cultural studies, factor analysis is widely used to uncover underlying dimensions or latent variables that explain observed patterns in survey data. The non-differentiable nature of these measurements deriving from survey data renders the former alignment methods infeasible for alignment with cultural dimensions. To overcome this, we propose a parameter efficient strategy that combines soft prompt tuning, which freezes the model parameters while modifying the input prompt embeddings, with Differential Evolution (DE), a black-box optimization method for cases where a differentiable objective is unattainable. This strategy ensures alignment consistency without the need for preference data or model parameter updates, significantly enhancing efficiency and mitigating overfitting. Our method demonstrates significant improvements in LLama-3-8B-Instruct's cultural dimensions across multiple regions, outperforming both the Naive LLM and the In-context Learning (ICL) baseline, and effectively bridges computational models with human cultural nuances.</p></details> |  |

They have pictorial ideographic features, and their symbols carry rich cultural and contextual information. Due to the lack of relevant datasets, existing research has difficulty in advancing the study of semantic understanding of Dongba pictographs. To this end, we propose \textbf{DongbaMIE}, the first multimodal dataset for semantic understanding and extraction of Dongba pictographs, consisting of Dongba pictograph images and corresponding Chinese semantic annotations. DongbaMIE contains 23,530 sentence-level and 2,539 paragraph-level images, covering four semantic dimensions: objects, actions, relations, and attributes. We systematically evaluate multimodal large language models (MLLMs), such as GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0, and Qwen2-VL. Experimental results show that best F1 scores of proprietary models, GPT-4o and Gemini, for object extraction task are only 3.16 and 3.11 respectively. For the open-source model Qwen2-VL, it achieves only 11.49 after supervised fine-tuning. These suggest that current MLLMs still face significant challenges in accurately recognizing diverse semantic information in Dongba pictographs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our d...</summary><p>Our dataset can be obtained from: https://github.com/thinklis/DongbaMIE</p></details> |

Previous approaches to modeling visual complexity assessments have often resulted in intricate, difficult-to-interpret algorithms that employ numerous features or sophisticated deep learning architectures. While these complex models achieve high performance on specific datasets, they often sacrifice interpretability, making it challenging to understand the factors driving human perception of complexity. Recently (Shen, et al. 2024) proposed an interpretable segmentation-based model that accurately predicted complexity across various datasets, supporting the idea that complexity can be explained simply. In this work, we investigate the failure of their model to capture structural, color and surprisal contributions to complexity. To this end, we propose Multi-Scale Sobel Gradient (MSG) which measures spatial intensity variations, Multi-Scale Unique Color (MUC) which quantifies colorfulness across multiple scales, and surprise scores generated using a Large Language Model. We test our features on existing benchmarks and a novel dataset (Surprising Visual Genome) containing surprising images from Visual Genome. Our experiments demonstrate that modeling complexity accurately is not as simple as previously thought, requiring additional perceptual and semantic factors to address dataset biases. Our model improves predictive performance while maintaining interpretability, offering deeper insights into how visual complexity is perceived and assessed.

The two mainstream solutions to incorporate memory into the generation process are long-context LLMs and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). In this paper, we first systematically compare these two types of solutions on three renovated/new datasets and show that (1) long-context solutions, although more expensive, shall be easier to capture the big picture and better answer queries which require considering the memory as a whole; and (2) when the queries concern specific information, RAG solutions shall be more competitive especially when the keywords can be explicitly matched. Therefore, we propose a novel method RAG-Tuned-LLM which fine-tunes a relative small (e.g., 7B) LLM using the data generated following the RAG principles, so it can combine the advantages of both solutions. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that RAG-Tuned-LLM can beat long-context LLMs and RAG methods across a wide range of query types.</p></details> |  |

However, real-world videos encompass omni-modal information (vision, audio, and speech) with a series of events forming a cohesive storyline. The lack of multi-modal video data with fine-grained event annotations and the high cost of manual labeling are major obstacles to comprehensive omni-modality video perception. To address this gap, we propose an automatic pipeline consisting of high-quality multi-modal video filtering, semantically coherent omni-modal event boundary detection, and cross-modal correlation-aware event captioning. In this way, we present LongVALE, the first-ever Vision-Audio-Language Event understanding benchmark comprising 105K omni-modal events with precise temporal boundaries and detailed relation-aware captions within 8.4K high-quality long videos. Further, we build a baseline that leverages LongVALE to enable video large language models (LLMs) for omni-modality fine-grained temporal video understanding for the first time. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and great potential of LongVALE in advancing comprehensive multi-modal video understanding.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |

Meta-learning has been proposed as a way to integrate human-like learning biases into neural-network architectures, combining both the structured generalizations of symbolic models with the scalability of neural-network models. But what does meta-learning exactly imbue the model with? We investigate the meta-learning of formal languages and find that, contrary to previous claims, meta-trained models are not learning simplicity-based priors when meta-trained on datasets organised around simplicity. Rather, we find evidence that meta-training imprints neural mechanisms (such as counters) into the model, which function like cognitive primitives for the network on downstream tasks. Most surprisingly, we find that meta-training on a single formal language can provide as much improvement to a model as meta-training on 5000 different formal languages, provided that the formal language incentivizes the learning of useful neural mechanisms. Taken together, our findings provide practical implications for efficient meta-learning paradigms and new theoretical insights into linking symbolic theories and neural mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[SePer: Measure Retrieval Utility Through The Lens Of Semantic Perplexity Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01478v5)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated improved generation performance by incorporating externally retrieved knowledge, a process known as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite the potential of this approach, existing studies evaluate RAG effectiveness by 1) assessing retrieval and generation components jointly, which obscures retrieval's distinct contribution, or 2) examining retrievers using traditional metrics such as NDCG, which creates a gap in understanding retrieval's true utility in the overall generation process. To address the above limitations, in this work, we introduce an automatic evaluation method that measures retrieval quality through the lens of information gain within the RAG framework. Specifically, we propose Semantic Perplexity (SePer), a metric that captures the LLM's internal belief about the correctness of the retrieved information. We quantify the utility of retrieval by the extent to which it reduces semantic perplexity post-retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SePer not only aligns closely with human preferences but also offers a more precise and efficient evaluation of retrieval utility across diverse RAG scenarios.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 Spotlight |

However, these models can still generate defective code that deviates from the specification. Previous research has mainly focused on the mistakes in LLM-generated standalone functions, overlooking real-world software development situations where the successful generation of the code requires software contexts such as external dependencies. In this paper, we considered both of these code generation situations and identified a range of \textit{non-syntactic mistakes} arising from LLMs' misunderstandings of coding question specifications. Seven categories of non-syntactic mistakes were identified through extensive manual analyses, four of which were missed by previous works. To better understand these mistakes, we proposed six reasons behind these mistakes from various perspectives. Moreover, we explored the effectiveness of LLMs in detecting mistakes and their reasons. Our evaluation demonstrated that GPT-4 with the ReAct prompting technique can achieve an F1 score of up to 0.65 when identifying reasons for LLM's mistakes, such as misleading function signatures. We believe that these findings offer valuable insights into enhancing the quality of LLM-generated code.</p></details> |  |

While these models have shown impressive performance on general language tasks, their effectiveness in specialized fields like legal remains unclear. To address this, we present a preliminary evaluation of LLMs in various legal scenarios, covering both Chinese and English legal tasks. Our analysis includes 9 LLMs and 17 legal tasks, with a focus on newly published and more complex challenges such as multi-defendant legal judgments and legal argument reasoning. Our findings indicate that, despite DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 being among the most powerful models, their legal reasoning capabilities are still lacking. Specifically, these models score below 80\% on seven Chinese legal reasoning tasks and below 80\% on two English legal reasoning tasks. This suggests that, even among the most advanced reasoning models, legal reasoning abilities remain underdeveloped.</p></details> |  |

However, the visual content is not equally contributed to user instructions, existing strategies (\eg, average pool) inevitably lead to the loss of potentially useful information. To tackle this, we propose the Hybrid-level Instruction Injection Strategy for Conditional Token Compression in MLLMs (HICom), utilizing the instruction as a condition to guide the compression from both local and global levels. This encourages the compression to retain the maximum amount of user-focused information while reducing visual tokens to minimize computational burden. Specifically, the instruction condition is injected into the grouped visual tokens at the local level and the learnable tokens at the global level, and we conduct the attention mechanism to complete the conditional compression. From the hybrid-level compression, the instruction-relevant visual parts are highlighted while the temporal-spatial structure is also preserved for easier understanding of LLMs. To further unleash the potential of HICom, we introduce a new conditional pre-training stage with our proposed dataset HICom-248K. Experiments show that our HICom can obtain distinguished video understanding ability with fewer tokens, increasing the performance by 2.43\% average on three multiple-choice QA benchmarks and saving 78.8\% tokens compared with the SOTA method.

While it enables LLMs to achieve human-level alignment, it often incurs significant computational and financial costs due to its reliance on training external reward models or human-labeled preferences. In this work, we propose Implicit Preference Optimization (IPO), an alternative approach that leverages generative LLMs as preference classifiers, thereby reducing the dependence on external human feedback or reward models to obtain preferences. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on the preference classification ability of LLMs using RewardBench, assessing models across different sizes, architectures, and training levels to validate our hypothesis. Furthermore, we investigate the self-improvement capabilities of LLMs by generating multiple responses for a given instruction and employing the model itself as a preference classifier for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)-based training. Our findings demonstrate that models trained through IPO achieve performance comparable to those utilizing state-of-the-art reward models for obtaining preferences.</p></details> |  |

While numerical reward signals and verifiers can effectively rank candidate actions, they often provide limited contextual guidance. In contrast, natural language feedback better aligns with the generative capabilities of LLMs, providing richer and more actionable suggestions. However, parsing and implementing this feedback effectively can be challenging for LLM-based agents. In this work, we introduce Critique-Guided Improvement (CGI), a novel two-player framework, comprising an actor model that explores an environment and a critic model that generates detailed nature language feedback. By training the critic to produce fine-grained assessments and actionable revisions, and the actor to utilize these critiques, our approach promotes more robust exploration of alternative strategies while avoiding local optima. Experiments in three interactive environments show that CGI outperforms existing baselines by a substantial margin. Notably, even a small critic model surpasses GPT-4 in feedback quality. The resulting actor achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating the power of explicit iterative guidance to enhance decision-making in LLM-based agents.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present TablePilot, a pioneering tabular data analysis framework leveraging large language models to autonomously generate comprehensive and superior analytical results without relying on user profiles or prior interactions. The framework incorporates key designs in analysis preparation and analysis optimization to enhance accuracy. Additionally, we propose Rec-Align, a novel method to further improve recommendation quality and better align with human preferences. Experiments on DART, a dataset specifically designed for comprehensive tabular data analysis recommendation, demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Based on GPT-4o, the tuned TablePilot achieves 77.0% top-5 recommendation recall.

MLLMs have been incorporated into diverse multi-modal applications, such as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis, via plug-and-play without fine-tuning. This deployment paradigm increases the vulnerability of MLLMs to backdoor attacks. However, existing backdoor attacks against MLLMs achieve limited effectiveness and stealthiness. In this work, we propose BadToken, the first token-level backdoor attack to MLLMs. BadToken introduces two novel backdoor behaviors: Token-substitution and Token-addition, which enable flexible and stealthy attacks by making token-level modifications to the original output for backdoored inputs. We formulate a general optimization problem that considers the two backdoor behaviors to maximize the attack effectiveness. We evaluate BadToken on two open-source MLLMs and various tasks. Our results show that our attack maintains the model's utility while achieving high attack success rates and stealthiness. We also show the real-world threats of BadToken in two scenarios, i.e., autonomous driving and medical diagnosis. Furthermore, we consider defenses including fine-tuning and input purification. Our results highlight the threat of our attack.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Despite its effectiveness, ICL is prone to errors, especially for challenging examples. With the goal of improving the performance of ICL, we propose corrective in-context learning (CICL), an approach that incorporates a model's incorrect predictions alongside ground truth corrections into the prompt, aiming to enhance classification accuracy through self-correction. However, contrary to our hypothesis, extensive experiments on text classification tasks demonstrate that CICL consistently underperforms standard ICL, with performance degrading as the proportion of corrections in the prompt increases. Our findings indicate that CICL introduces confusion by disrupting the model's task understanding, rather than refining its predictions. Additionally, we observe that presenting harder examples in standard ICL does not improve performance, suggesting that example difficulty alone may not be a reliable criterion for effective selection. By presenting these negative results, we provide important insights into the limitations of self-corrective mechanisms in LLMs and offer directions for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 6th Workshop on Insights from Negative Results in NLP at NAACL 2025</p></details> |

This technological advancement raises fundamental questions about AI's potential impact on the diversity and democratic value of information ecosystems. Here, we introduce a large-scale simulation framework to examine AI-based imitation in news, a context critically influential for public discourse. By systematically testing two distinct imitation strategies across a range of information environments varying in initial diversity, we demonstrate that AI-generated articles do not uniformly homogenize content. Instead, AI's influence is strongly context-dependent: AI-generated articles can introduce valuable diversity in originally homogeneous news environments, while potentially diminishing diversity in contexts that initially display high heterogeneity. These results illustrate that the baseline diversity of an information space critically shapes AI's impact, challenging assumptions that AI-driven imitation uniformly threatens information diversity. Instead, when information is initially homogeneous, AI-driven imitation can expand perspectives, styles, and topics. This is especially important in news contexts, where information diversity fosters richer public debate by exposing citizens to alternative viewpoints, challenging biases, and preventing narrative monopolies, which is essential for a resilient democracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Existing methods utilize the contextual understanding capabilities of the large language models (LLMs) to establish mappings between expressions and targets, allowing robots to comprehend users' intentions in the instructions. However, the LLM's knowledge about objects' physical properties remains underexplored despite its tight relevance to grasping. In this work, we propose GraspCoT, a 6-DoF grasp detection framework that integrates a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning mechanism oriented to physical properties, guided by auxiliary question-answering (QA) tasks. Particularly, we design a set of QA templates to enable hierarchical reasoning that includes three stages: target parsing, physical property analysis, and grasp action selection. Moreover, GraspCoT presents a unified multimodal LLM architecture, which encodes multi-view observations of 3D scenes into 3D-aware visual tokens, and then jointly embeds these visual tokens with CoT-derived textual tokens within LLMs to generate grasp pose predictions. Furthermore, we present IntentGrasp, a large-scale benchmark that fills the gap in public datasets for multi-object grasp detection under diverse and indirect verbal commands. Extensive experiments on IntentGrasp demonstrate the superiority of our method, with additional validation in real-world robotic applications confirming its practicality.

We conducted a within-subjects user study with eight investigative journalists. In interviews, we elicited practical use cases using a speculative design approach by having journalists react to a prototype of a system that combines LLMs and Programming-by-Demonstration (PbD) to simplify data collection on numerous websites. Based on user reports, we classified the journalistic processes into data collecting and reporting.

Large language models (LLMs) create new possibilities for providing personalized travel safety advice.

Activation editing modifies LLM representations by preserving information from positive demonstrations (e.g., truthful) and minimising information from negative demonstrations (e.g., hallucinations). When these demonstrations come from a private dataset, the aligned LLM may leak private information contained in those private samples. In this work, we present the first study of aligning LLM behavior with private datasets. Our work proposes the Private Steering for LLM Alignment (PSA) algorithm to edit LLM activations with differential privacy (DP) guarantees. We conduct extensive experiments on seven different benchmarks with open-source LLMs of different sizes (0.5B to 7B) and model families (LlaMa, Qwen, Mistral and Gemma). Our results show that PSA achieves DP guarantees for LLM alignment with minimal loss in performance, including alignment metrics, open-ended text generation quality, and general-purpose reasoning. We also develop the first Membership Inference Attack (MIA) for evaluating and auditing the empirical privacy for the problem of LLM steering via activation editing. Our experiments support the theoretical guarantees by showing improved guarantees for our PSA algorithm compared to several existing non-private techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 Camera Ready; Code: https://github.com/UKPLab/iclr2025-psa</p></details> |

Their potential in e-commerce is also substantial, evidenced by practical implementations such as platform search, personalized recommendations, and customer service. One primary concern associated with LLMs is their factuality (e.g., hallucination), which is urgent in e-commerce due to its significant impact on user experience and revenue. Despite some methods proposed to evaluate LLMs' factuality, issues such as lack of reliability, high consumption, and lack of domain expertise leave a gap between effective assessment in e-commerce. To bridge the evaluation gap, we propose ECKGBench, a dataset specifically designed to evaluate the capacities of LLMs in e-commerce knowledge. Specifically, we adopt a standardized workflow to automatically generate questions based on a large-scale knowledge graph, guaranteeing sufficient reliability. We employ the simple question-answering paradigm, substantially improving the evaluation efficiency by the least input and output tokens. Furthermore, we inject abundant e-commerce expertise in each evaluation stage, including human annotation, prompt design, negative sampling, and verification. Besides, we explore the LLMs' knowledge boundaries in e-commerce from a novel perspective. Through comprehensive evaluations of several advanced LLMs on ECKGBench, we provide meticulous analysis and insights into leveraging LLMs for e-commerce.</p></details> |  |
| **[Polynomial Composition Activations: Unleashing the Dynamics of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03884v3)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have found extensive applications across various domains due to the powerful fitting capabilities. This success can be partially attributed to their inherent nonlinearity. Thus, in addition to the ReLU function employed in the original transformer architecture, researchers have explored alternative modules such as GeLU and SwishGLU to enhance nonlinearity and thereby augment representational capacity. In this paper, we propose a novel category of polynomial composition activations (PolyCom), designed to optimize the dynamics of transformers. Theoretically, we provide a comprehensive mathematical analysis of PolyCom, highlighting its enhanced expressivity and efficacy relative to other activation functions. Notably, we demonstrate that networks incorporating PolyCom achieve the $\textbf{optimal approximation rate}$, indicating that PolyCom networks require minimal parameters to approximate general smooth functions in Sobolev spaces. We conduct empirical experiments on the pre-training configurations of large language models (LLMs), including both dense and sparse architectures. By substituting conventional activation functions with PolyCom, we enable LLMs to capture higher-order interactions within the data, thus improving performance metrics in terms of accuracy and convergence rates. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing substantial improvements over other activation functions.

Popular sampling methods like top-p (nucleus sampling) often struggle to balance quality and diversity, especially at higher temperatures which lead to incoherent or repetitive outputs. We propose min-p sampling, a dynamic truncation method that adjusts the sampling threshold based on the model's confidence by using the top token's probability as a scaling factor. Our experiments on benchmarks including GPQA, GSM8K, and AlpacaEval Creative Writing show that min-p sampling improves both the quality and diversity of generated text across different model families (Mistral and Llama 3) and model sizes (1B to 123B parameters), especially at higher temperatures. Human evaluations further show a clear preference for min-p sampling, in both text quality and creativity. Min-p sampling has been adopted by popular open-source LLM frameworks, including Hugging Face Transformers, VLLM, and many others, highlighting its significant impact on improving text generation quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added acknowledgements and minor rewordings to make the intro/abstract more readable.

However, in many applications, simulators are unable to produce the ground-truth data needed for automated test oracles and to guide the search process. To tackle this issue, we propose an approach for the generation of inputs for computer vision DNNs that integrates a generative network to ensure simulator fidelity and employs heuristic-based search fitnesses that leverage transformation consistency, noise resistance, surprise adequacy, and uncertainty estimation. We compare the performance of our fitnesses with that of a traditional fitness function leveraging ground truth; further, we assess how the integration of a GAN not leveraging the ground truth impacts on test and retraining effectiveness. Our results suggest that leveraging transformation consistency is the best option to generate inputs for both DNN testing and retraining; it maximizes input diversity, spots the inputs leading to worse DNN performance, and leads to best DNN performance after retraining. Besides enabling simulator-based testing in the absence of ground truth, our findings pave the way for testing solutions that replace costly simulators with diffusion and large language models, which might be more affordable than simulators, but cannot generate ground-truth data.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |

However, empowering Large Language Models to perceive and generate images, texts, and speeches end-to-end with publicly available data remains challenging for the open-source community. Existing vision-language models rely on external tools for speech processing, while speech-language models still suffer from limited or totally without vision-understanding capabilities. To address this gap, we propose the EMOVA (EMotionally Omni-present Voice Assistant), to enable Large Language Models with end-to-end speech abilities while maintaining the leading vision-language performance. With a semantic-acoustic disentangled speech tokenizer, we surprisingly notice that omni-modal alignment can further enhance vision-language and speech abilities compared with the bi-modal aligned counterparts. Moreover, a lightweight style module is introduced for the flexible speech style controls including emotions and pitches. For the first time, EMOVA achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the vision-language and speech benchmarks, and meanwhile, supporting omni-modal spoken dialogue with vivid emotions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025.

| **[From Chaos to Order: The Atomic Reasoner Framework for Fine-grained Reasoning in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15944v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress, yet their capacity for logical ``slow-thinking'' reasoning persists as a critical research frontier. Current inference scaling paradigms suffer from two fundamental constraints: fragmented thought flows compromising logical coherence, and intensively computational complexity that escalates with search space dimensions. To overcome these limitations, we present \textbf{Atomic Reasoner} (\textbf{AR}), a cognitive inference strategy that enables fine-grained reasoning through systematic atomic-level operations. AR decomposes the reasoning process into atomic cognitive units, employing a cognitive routing mechanism to dynamically construct reasoning representations and orchestrate inference pathways. This systematic methodology implements stepwise, structured cognition, which ensures logical coherence while significantly reducing cognitive load, effectively simulating the cognitive patterns observed in human deep thinking processes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate AR's superior reasoning capabilities without the computational burden of exhaustive solution searches, particularly excelling in linguistic logic puzzles. These findings substantiate AR's effectiveness in enhancing LLMs' capacity for robust, long-sequence logical reasoning and deliberation.</p></details> |  |

However, these pre-trained models often require full fine-tuning on each downstream task to achieve substantial improvements, limiting their versatility and usability, and leading to considerable resource wastage. To tackle these challenges, we propose NeuroLM, the first multi-task foundation model that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by regarding EEG signals as a foreign language, endowing the model with multi-task learning and inference capabilities. Our approach begins with learning a text-aligned neural tokenizer through vector-quantized temporal-frequency prediction, which encodes EEG signals into discrete neural tokens. These EEG tokens, generated by the frozen vector-quantized (VQ) encoder, are then fed into an LLM that learns causal EEG information via multi-channel autoregression. Consequently, NeuroLM can understand both EEG and language modalities. Finally, multi-task instruction tuning adapts NeuroLM to various downstream tasks. We are the first to demonstrate that, by specific incorporation with LLMs, NeuroLM unifies diverse EEG tasks within a single model through instruction tuning. The largest variant NeuroLM-XL has record-breaking 1.7B parameters for EEG signal processing, and is pre-trained on a large-scale corpus comprising approximately 25,000-hour EEG data. When evaluated on six diverse downstream datasets, NeuroLM showcases the huge potential of this multi-task learning paradigm.</p></details> | <details><summary>The T...</summary><p>The Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations</p></details> |

Unlike previous mobile agents that utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) as generators to directly generate actions at each step, V-Droid employs LLMs as verifiers to evaluate candidate actions before making final decisions. To realize this novel paradigm, we introduce a comprehensive framework for constructing verifier-driven mobile agents: the discretized action space construction coupled with the prefilling-only workflow to accelerate the verification process, the pair-wise progress preference training to significantly enhance the verifier's decision-making capabilities, and the scalable human-agent joint annotation scheme to efficiently collect the necessary data at scale. V-Droid sets a new state-of-the-art task success rate across several public mobile task automation benchmarks: 59.5% on AndroidWorld, 38.3% on AndroidLab, and 49% on MobileAgentBench, surpassing existing agents by 9.5%, 2.1%, and 9%, respectively. Furthermore, V-Droid achieves an impressively low latency of 0.7 seconds per step, making it the first mobile agent capable of delivering near-real-time, effective decision-making capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 itertions</p></details> |

In domain-specific contexts, maintaining data quality and managing system constraints remain key challenges. To address these issues, we propose an automated continual instruction tuning framework that dynamically filters incoming data, which identify and reduce redundant data across successive updates. Our approach utilizes a small proxy model for efficient perplexity-based filtering, and updates the proxy to ensure that the filtering criteria remain aligned with the evolving state of the deployed model. Compared to existing static data selection methods, our framework can effectively handle incrementally acquired data and shifting distributions. Additionally, it addresses practical deployment challenges by enabling seamless model updates, supporting version rollback and incorporating automatic checkpoint evaluation. We evaluated the system in real-world medical scenarios. It reduced computational costs by 66.7% and improved model performance, and achieved autonomous updates, thus demonstrating its effectiveness for automatic continual instruction tuning.</p></details> |  |

However, current state-of-the-art speculative decoding approaches have three key limitations: handling requests with varying difficulty using homogeneous SSMs, lack of robust support for batch processing, and insufficient holistic optimization for both speculation and verification phases. In this paper, we introduce SPIN, an efficient LLM inference serving system based on speculative decoding, designed to address these challenges through three main innovations. First, SPIN improves token speculation by using multiple heterogeneous SSMs, with a learning-based algorithm for SSM selection that operates without prior knowledge of request difficulty. Second, SPIN employs a request decomposition method to minimize batching overhead during LLM verification. Finally, SPIN orchestrates speculation and verification phases by pipelining their executions on GPUs to achieve further acceleration. Experimental results demonstrate that SPIN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a performance increase of approximately 2.28X.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by INFOCOM 2025</p></details> |

Context-Aware Evaluation for Balancing Preservation and Modification in Text-Guided Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11374v3)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of vision-language and generative models has significantly advanced text-guided image editing, which seeks the preservation of core elements in the source image while implementing modifications based on the target text. However, existing metrics have a context-blindness problem, indiscriminately applying the same evaluation criteria on completely different pairs of source image and target text, biasing towards either modification or preservation. Directional CLIP similarity, the only metric that considers both source image and target text, is also biased towards modification aspects and attends to irrelevant editing regions of the image. We propose AugCLIP, a context-aware metric that adaptively coordinates preservation and modification aspects, depending on the specific context of a given source image and target text. This is done by deriving the CLIP representation of an ideally edited image, that preserves the source image with necessary modifications to align with target text. More specifically, using a multi-modal large language model, AugCLIP augments the textual descriptions of the source and target, then calculates a modification vector through a hyperplane that separates source and target attributes in CLIP space. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, encompassing a diverse range of editing scenarios, show that AugCLIP aligns remarkably well with human evaluation standards, outperforming existing metrics.

This study introduces a novel evaluation framework to uncover gender biases in LLMs, focusing on their occupational narratives. Unlike previous methods relying on structured scenarios or carefully crafted prompts, our approach leverages free-form storytelling to reveal biases embedded in the models. Systematic analyses show an overrepresentation of female characters across occupations in six widely used LLMs. Additionally, our findings reveal that LLM-generated occupational gender rankings align more closely with human stereotypes than actual labor statistics. These insights underscore the need for balanced mitigation strategies to ensure fairness while avoiding the reinforcement of new stereotypes.</p></details> |  |

ATS has drawn considerable interest in both academic and industrial circles. Many studies have been conducted in the past to survey ATS methods; however, they generally lack practicality for real-world implementations, as they often categorize previous methods from a theoretical standpoint. Moreover, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has altered conventional ATS methods. In this survey, we aim to 1) provide a comprehensive overview of ATS from a ``Process-Oriented Schema'' perspective, which is best aligned with real-world implementations; 2) comprehensively review the latest LLM-based ATS works; and 3) deliver an up-to-date survey of ATS, bridging the two-year gap in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey to specifically investigate LLM-based ATS methods.</p></details> |  |

Despite this progress, seamlessly adding objects to images based on textual instructions without requiring user-provided input masks remains a challenge. We address this by leveraging the insight that removing objects (Inpaint) is significantly simpler than its inverse process of adding them (Paint), attributed to inpainting models that benefit from segmentation mask guidance. Capitalizing on this realization, by implementing an automated and extensive pipeline, we curate a filtered large-scale image dataset containing pairs of images and their corresponding object-removed versions. Using these pairs, we train a diffusion model to inverse the inpainting process, effectively adding objects into images. Unlike other editing datasets, ours features natural target images instead of synthetic ones while ensuring source-target consistency by construction. Additionally, we utilize a large Vision-Language Model to provide detailed descriptions of the removed objects and a Large Language Model to convert these descriptions into diverse, natural-language instructions. Our quantitative and qualitative results show that the trained model surpasses existing models in both object addition and general editing tasks.

This paper systematically investigates domain adaptation of MLLMs through post-training, focusing on data synthesis, training pipelines, and task evaluation. (1) Data Synthesis: Using only open-source models, we develop a generate-then-filter pipeline that curates diverse visual instruction tasks based on domain-specific image-caption pairs. The resulting data surpass the data synthesized by manual rules or strong closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4V) in enhancing domain-specific performance. (2) Training Pipeline: While the two-stage training--initially on image-caption pairs followed by visual instruction tasks--is commonly adopted for developing general MLLMs, we apply a single-stage training pipeline to enhance task diversity for domain-specific post-training. (3) Task Evaluation: We conduct extensive experiments in high-impact domains such as biomedicine, food, and remote sensing, by post-training a variety of MLLMs and then evaluating MLLM performance on various domain-specific tasks. Furthermore, we fully open-source our models, code, and data to encourage future research in this area.</p></details> |  |

However, conflicts between parametric knowledge and retrieved context pose challenges, particularly when retrieved information is unreliable or the model's internal knowledge is outdated. In such cases, LLMs struggle to determine whether to rely more on their own parameters or the conflicted context. To address this, we propose **CK-PLUG**, a plug-and-play method for controlling LLMs' reliance on parametric and contextual knowledge. We introduce a novel knowledge consistency metric, Confidence Gain, which detects knowledge conflicts by measuring entropy shifts in token probability distributions after context insertion. CK-PLUG then enables fine-grained control over knowledge preference by adjusting the probability distribution of tokens with negative confidence gain through a single tuning parameter. Experiments demonstrate CK-PLUG's ability to significantly regulate knowledge reliance in counterfactual RAG scenarios while maintaining generation fluency and knowledge accuracy. For instance, on Llama3-8B, memory recall (MR) of RAG response can be adjusted within a broad range (9.9%-71.9%), compared to the baseline of 42.1%. Moreover, CK-PLUG supports adaptive control based on the model's confidence in both internal and external knowledge, achieving consistent performance improvements across various general RAG tasks.

However, existing vision-language models (VLMs), despite achieving significant progress through large-scale natural language supervision, often underperform in real-world applications because of sub-optimal prompt engineering and the inability to adapt effectively to target classes. To address these issues, we propose a Concept-guided Human-like Bayesian Reasoning (CHBR) framework. Grounded in Bayes' theorem, CHBR models the concept used in human image recognition as latent variables and formulates this task by summing across potential concepts, weighted by a prior distribution and a likelihood function. To tackle the intractable computation over an infinite concept space, we introduce an importance sampling algorithm that iteratively prompts large language models (LLMs) to generate discriminative concepts, emphasizing inter-class differences. We further propose three heuristic approaches involving Average Likelihood, Confidence Likelihood, and Test Time Augmentation (TTA) Likelihood, which dynamically refine the combination of concepts based on the test image. Extensive evaluations across fifteen datasets demonstrate that CHBR consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 7 figures 7 tables</p></details> |

The system consists of two core components: (1) a multi-stage response-capable dialogue model (\textit{deeppsy-chat}), which enhances reasoning capabilities through stage-awareness and deep-thinking analysis to generate high-quality responses; and (2) a real-time stage transition detection model that identifies contextual shifts to guide the dialogue towards more effective intervention stages. Based on 30,000 real psychological hotline conversations, we employ AI-simulated dialogues and expert re-annotation strategies to construct a high-quality multi-turn dialogue dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that DeepPsy-Agent outperforms general-purpose large language models (LLMs) in key metrics such as problem exposure completeness, cognitive restructuring success rate, and action adoption rate. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of stage-awareness and deep-thinking modules, showing that stage information contributes 42.3\% to performance, while the deep-thinking module increases root-cause identification by 58.3\% and reduces ineffective suggestions by 72.1\%. This system addresses critical challenges in AI-based psychological support through dynamic dialogue management and deep reasoning, advancing intelligent mental health services.</p></details> |  |

We observe that existing Video-LLMs often suffer from action-scene hallucination due to two main factors. First, existing Video-LLMs intermingle spatial and temporal features by applying an attention operation across all tokens. Second, they use the standard Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), which causes the text tokens to overemphasize certain types of tokens depending on their sequential orders. To address these issues, we introduce MASH-VLM, Mitigating Action-Scene Hallucination in Video-LLMs through disentangled spatial-temporal representations. Our approach includes two key innovations: (1) DST-attention, a novel attention mechanism that disentangles the spatial and temporal tokens within the LLM by using masked attention to restrict direct interactions between the spatial and temporal tokens; (2) Harmonic-RoPE, which extends the dimensionality of the positional IDs, allowing the spatial and temporal tokens to maintain balanced positions relative to the text tokens. To evaluate the action-scene hallucination in Video-LLMs, we introduce the UNSCENE benchmark with 1,320 videos and 4,078 QA pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MASH-VLM achieves state-of-the-art results on the UNSCENE benchmark, as well as on existing video understanding benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Moreover, these methods perform unlearning at a coarse granularity, often leading to excessive forgetting and reduced model utility. To address this issue, we introduce SAUCE, a novel method that leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) for fine-grained and selective concept unlearning in VLMs. Briefly, SAUCE first trains SAEs to capture high-dimensional, semantically rich sparse features. It then identifies the features most relevant to the target concept for unlearning. During inference, it selectively modifies these features to suppress specific concepts while preserving unrelated information. We evaluate SAUCE on two distinct VLMs, LLaVA-v1.5-7B and LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct, across two types of tasks: concrete concept unlearning (objects and sports scenes) and abstract concept unlearning (emotions, colors, and materials), encompassing a total of 60 concepts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAUCE outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 18.04% in unlearning quality while maintaining comparable model utility. Furthermore, we investigate SAUCE's robustness against widely used adversarial attacks, its transferability across models, and its scalability in handling multiple simultaneous unlearning requests. Our findings establish SAUCE as an effective and scalable solution for selective concept unlearning in VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>More ...</summary><p>More comparative experiments are needed</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we propose TruthLens, a novel and highly generalizable framework for DeepFake detection that not only determines whether an image is real or fake but also provides detailed textual reasoning for its predictions. Unlike traditional methods, TruthLens effectively handles both face-manipulated DeepFakes and fully AI-generated content while addressing fine-grained queries such as "Does the eyes/nose/mouth look real or fake?" The architecture of TruthLens combines the global contextual understanding of multimodal large language models like PaliGemma2 with the localized feature extraction capabilities of vision-only models like DINOv2. This hybrid design leverages the complementary strengths of both models, enabling robust detection of subtle manipulations while maintaining interpretability. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that TruthLens outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detection accuracy (by 2-14%) and explainability, in both in-domain and cross-data settings, generalizing effectively across traditional and emerging manipulation techniques.</p></details> |  |

Traditional malware detection methods rely on binary classification, failing to provide insights into adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs). Understanding malware behavior is crucial for enhancing cybersecurity defenses. To address this gap, we introduce DroidTTP, a framework mapping Android malware behaviors to TTPs based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Our curated dataset explicitly links MITRE TTPs to Android applications. We developed an automated solution leveraging the Problem Transformation Approach (PTA) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to map applications to both Tactics and Techniques. Additionally, we employed Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with prompt engineering and LLM fine-tuning for TTP predictions. Our structured pipeline includes dataset creation, hyperparameter tuning, data augmentation, feature selection, model development, and SHAP-based model interpretability. Among LLMs, Llama achieved the highest performance in Tactic classification with a Jaccard Similarity of 0.9583 and Hamming Loss of 0.0182, and in Technique classification with a Jaccard Similarity of 0.9348 and Hamming Loss of 0.0127. However, the Label Powerset XGBoost model outperformed LLMs, achieving a Jaccard Similarity of 0.9893 for Tactic classification and 0.9753 for Technique classification, with a Hamming Loss of 0.0054 and 0.0050, respectively. While XGBoost showed superior performance, the narrow margin highlights the potential of LLM-based approaches in TTP classification.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, the performance of on-device LLMs is intrinsically constrained by resource limitations on edge devices. Sitting between cloud and on-device AI, mobile edge intelligence (MEI) presents a viable solution by provisioning AI capabilities at the edge of mobile networks, enabling end users to offload heavy AI computation to capable edge servers nearby. This article provides a contemporary survey on harnessing MEI for LLMs. We begin by illustrating several killer applications to demonstrate the urgent need for deploying LLMs at the network edge. Next, we present the preliminaries of LLMs and MEI, followed by resource-efficient LLM techniques. We then present an architectural overview of MEI for LLMs (MEI4LLM), outlining its core components and how it supports the deployment of LLMs. Subsequently, we delve into various aspects of MEI4LLM, extensively covering edge LLM caching and delivery, edge LLM training, and edge LLM inference. Finally, we identify future research opportunities. We hope this article inspires researchers in the field to leverage mobile edge computing to facilitate LLM deployment, thereby unleashing the potential of LLMs across various privacy- and delay-sensitive applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 17 figures.

Existing benchmarks primarily focus on generic text generation or limited in writing tasks, failing to capture the diverse requirements of high-quality written contents across various domains. To bridge this gap, we present WritingBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs across 6 core writing domains and 100 subdomains, encompassing creative, persuasive, informative, and technical writing. We further propose a query-dependent evaluation framework that empowers LLMs to dynamically generate instance-specific assessment criteria. This framework is complemented by a fine-tuned critic model for criteria-aware scoring, enabling evaluations in style, format and length. The framework's validity is further demonstrated by its data curation capability, which enables 7B-parameter models to approach state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. We open-source the benchmark, along with evaluation tools and modular framework components, to advance the development of LLMs in writing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty Quantification and Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15850v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in text generation, reasoning, and decision-making, enabling their adoption in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, law, and transportation. However, their reliability is a major concern, as they often produce plausible but incorrect responses. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) enhances trustworthiness by estimating confidence in outputs, enabling risk mitigation and selective prediction. However, traditional UQ methods struggle with LLMs due to computational constraints and decoding inconsistencies. Moreover, LLMs introduce unique uncertainty sources, such as input ambiguity, reasoning path divergence, and decoding stochasticity, that extend beyond classical aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. To address this, we introduce a new taxonomy that categorizes UQ methods based on computational efficiency and uncertainty dimensions (input, reasoning, parameter, and prediction uncertainty). We evaluate existing techniques, assess their real-world applicability, and identify open challenges, emphasizing the need for scalable, interpretable, and robust UQ approaches to enhance LLM reliability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Entropy-based Exploration Conduction for Multi-step Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15848v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In large language model (LLM) reasoning, multi-step processes have proven effective for solving complex tasks. However, the depth of exploration can significantly affect the reasoning performance. Existing methods to automatically decide the depth often bring high costs and lack flexibility, and thus undermine the model's reasoning accuracy. To address these issues, we propose Entropy-based Exploration Depth Conduction (Entro-duction), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the exploration depth during multi-step reasoning by monitoring LLM's output entropy and variance entropy. We employ these two metrics to capture the model's current uncertainty and the fluctuation of uncertainty across consecutive reasoning steps. Based on the observed changes, the LLM selects whether to deepen, expand or stop exploration according to the probability. In this way, we balance the reasoning accuracy and exploration effectiveness. Experimental results across four benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of Entro-duction. We further conduct experiments and analysis on the components of Entro-duction to discuss their contributions to reasoning performance.</p></details> |  |

In particular, the compliance of formal languages with respect to safety restrictions imposed on CPS is crucial for system safety. In this paper, we introduce AutoSafeLTL, a self-supervised framework that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of safety-compliant LTL. Our approach integrates a Language Inclusion check with an automated counterexample-guided feedback and modification mechanism, establishing a pipeline that verifies the safety-compliance of the resulting LTL while preserving its logical consistency and semantic accuracy. To enhance the framework's understanding and correction capabilities, we incorporate two additional Agent LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that AutoSafeLTL effectively guarantees safety-compliance for generated LTL, achieving a 0% violation rate against imposed safety constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing LLM Code Generation with Ensembles: A Similarity-Based Selection Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15838v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensemble learning has been widely used in machine learning to improve model robustness, accuracy, and generalization, but has not yet been applied to code generation tasks with large language models (LLMs). We propose an ensemble approach for LLMs in code generation. Instead of relying on the output of a single model, we generate multiple candidate programs from different LLMs and apply a structured voting mechanism to select the most reliable solution. For voting, we compute syntactic and semantic similarity using CodeBLEU and behavioral equivalence using CrossHair's differential behavior analysis. By aggregating these similarity scores, we select the program that best aligns with the consensus among the candidates. We show through experiments that our ensemble approach consistently outperforms standalone LLMs on the well-known HumanEval and the more challenging LiveCodeBench datasets, achieving an accuracy of 90.2% and 50.2%, respectively, on the two datasets. In comparison, the best-performing LLM (GPT-4o) has an accuracy of 83.5% and 43.4%, respectively. Furthermore, even when restricted to free open-source models, our method achieves an accuracy of 80.5% and 41.6%, respectively, demonstrating the viability of our approach in resource-constrained settings.</p></details> |  |

While existing benchmarks have primarily focused on evaluating comprehension through multiple-choice questions, there remains a critical gap in assessing models' generative capabilities in classical Chinese. We introduce F\`ux\`i, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates both understanding and generation capabilities across 21 diverse tasks. Our benchmark distinguishes itself through three key contributions: (1) balanced coverage of both comprehension and generation tasks, including novel tasks like poetry composition and couplet completion, (2) specialized evaluation metrics designed specifically for classical Chinese text generation, combining rule-based verification with fine-tuned LLM evaluators, and (3) a systematic assessment framework that considers both linguistic accuracy and cultural authenticity. Through extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs, we reveal significant performance gaps between understanding and generation tasks, with models achieving promising results in comprehension but struggling considerably in generation tasks, particularly those requiring deep cultural knowledge and adherence to classical formats. Our findings highlight the current limitations in ancient Chinese text processing and provide insights for future model development. The benchmark, evaluation toolkit, and baseline results are publicly available to facilitate research in this domain.</p></details> | working in progress |

| **[Tuning LLMs by RAG Principles: Towards LLM-native Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16071v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Memory, additional information beyond the training of large language models (LLMs), is crucial to various real-world applications, such as personal assistant. The two mainstream solutions to incorporate memory into the generation process are long-context LLMs and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). In this paper, we first systematically compare these two types of solutions on three renovated/new datasets and show that (1) long-context solutions, although more expensive, shall be easier to capture the big picture and better answer queries which require considering the memory as a whole; and (2) when the queries concern specific information, RAG solutions shall be more competitive especially when the keywords can be explicitly matched. Therefore, we propose a novel method RAG-Tuned-LLM which fine-tunes a relative small (e.g., 7B) LLM using the data generated following the RAG principles, so it can combine the advantages of both solutions. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that RAG-Tuned-LLM can beat long-context LLMs and RAG methods across a wide range of query types.</p></details> |  |

The recent purposed Mixed-Precision Over-the-Air Federated Learning (MP-OTA-FL) enables clients to operate at appropriate precision levels based on their heterogeneous hardware, taking advantages of the larger trade-off space while covering the quantization overheads in the mixed-precision modulation scheme for the OTA aggregation process. A key to further exploring the potential of the MP-OTA-FL framework is the optimization of client precision levels. The choice of precision level hinges on multifaceted factors including hardware capability, potential client contribution, and user satisfaction, among which factors can be difficult to define or quantify. In this paper, we propose a RAG-based User Profiling for precision planning framework that integrates retrieval-augmented LLMs and dynamic client profiling to optimize satisfaction and contributions. This includes a hybrid interface for gathering device/user insights and an RAG database storing historical quantization decisions with feedback. Experiments show that our method boosts satisfaction, energy savings, and global model accuracy in MP-OTA-FL systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, submitted to IEEE VTC 2025 fall for possible publication</p></details> |

Chatbots as question-answering systems can help in solving these challenges. LLM chatbots use NLP techniques to establish connections between topics and accurately respond to complex questions. These capabilities make it perfect for enlightenment on religion as a question-answering chatbot. However, LLMs also tend to generate false information, known as hallucination. Also, the chatbots' responses can include content that insults personal religious beliefs, interfaith conflicts, and controversial or sensitive topics. It must avoid such cases without promoting hate speech or offending certain groups of people or their beliefs. This study uses a vector database-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to enhance the accuracy and transparency of LLMs. Our question-answering system is called "MufassirQAS". We created a database consisting of several open-access books that include Turkish context. These books contain Turkish translations and interpretations of Islam. This database is utilized to answer religion-related questions and ensure our answers are trustworthy. The relevant part of the dataset, which LLM also uses, is presented along with the answer. We have put careful effort into creating system prompts that give instructions to prevent harmful, offensive, or disrespectful responses to respect people's values and provide reliable results. The system answers and shares additional information, such as the page number from the respective book and the articles referenced for obtaining the information. MufassirQAS and ChatGPT are also tested with sensitive questions. We got better performance with our system. Study and enhancements are still in progress. Results and future works are given.</p></details> |  |
| **[SOSecure: Safer Code Generation with RAG and StackOverflow Discussions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13654v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for automated code generation. Their reliance on infrequently updated pretraining data leaves them unaware of newly discovered vulnerabilities and evolving security standards, making them prone to producing insecure code. In contrast, developer communities on Stack Overflow (SO) provide an ever-evolving repository of knowledge, where security vulnerabilities are actively discussed and addressed through collective expertise. These community-driven insights remain largely untapped by LLMs. This paper introduces SOSecure, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that leverages the collective security expertise found in SO discussions to improve the security of LLM-generated code. We build a security-focused knowledge base by extracting SO answers and comments that explicitly identify vulnerabilities. Unlike common uses of RAG, SOSecure triggers after code has been generated to find discussions that identify flaws in similar code. These are used in a prompt to an LLM to consider revising the code. Evaluation across three datasets (SALLM, LLMSecEval, and LMSys) show that SOSecure achieves strong fix rates of 71.7%, 91.3%, and 96.7% respectively, compared to prompting GPT-4 without relevant discussions (49.1%, 56.5%, and 37.5%), and outperforms multiple other baselines. SOSecure operates as a language-agnostic complement to existing LLMs, without requiring retraining or fine-tuning, making it easy to deploy. Our results underscore the importance of maintaining active developer forums, which have dropped substantially in usage with LLM adoptions.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we proposed MES-RAG framework, which enhances entity-specific query handling and provides accurate, secure, and consistent responses. MES-RAG introduces proactive security measures that ensure system integrity by applying protections prior to data access. Additionally, the system supports real-time multi-modal outputs, including text, images, audio, and video, seamlessly integrating into existing RAG architectures. Experimental results demonstrate that MES-RAG significantly improves both accuracy and recall, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing the security and utility of question-answering, increasing accuracy to 0.83 (+0.25) on targeted task.

| **[Privacy-Aware RAG: Secure and Isolated Knowledge Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15548v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in real-world applications has heightened concerns about the confidentiality and integrity of their proprietary knowledge bases. These knowledge bases, which play a critical role in enhancing the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly vulnerable to breaches that could compromise sensitive information. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an advanced encryption methodology designed to protect RAG systems from unauthorized access and data leakage. Our approach encrypts both textual content and its corresponding embeddings prior to storage, ensuring that all data remains securely encrypted. This mechanism restricts access to authorized entities with the appropriate decryption keys, thereby significantly reducing the risk of unintended data exposure. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our encryption strategy preserves the performance and functionality of RAG pipelines, ensuring compatibility across diverse domains and applications. To validate the robustness of our method, we provide comprehensive security proofs that highlight its resilience against potential threats and vulnerabilities. These proofs also reveal limitations in existing approaches, which often lack robustness, adaptability, or reliance on open-source models. Our findings suggest that integrating advanced encryption techniques into the design and deployment of RAG systems can effectively enhance privacy safeguards. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on improving security measures for AI-driven services and advocates for stricter data protection standards within RAG architectures.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advancements, LLMs still face significant challenges in reasoning with structured data, handling dynamic knowledge evolution, and mitigating hallucinations, particularly in mission-critical domains. Our proposed RAG-KG-IL framework addresses these limitations by employing a multi-agent architecture that enables continuous knowledge updates, integrates structured knowledge, and incorporates autonomous agents for enhanced explainability and reasoning. The framework utilizes RAG to ensure the generated responses are grounded in verifiable information, while KGs provide structured domain knowledge for improved consistency and depth of understanding. The Incremental Learning approach allows for dynamic updates to the knowledge base without full retraining, significantly reducing computational overhead and improving the model's adaptability. We evaluate the framework using real-world case studies involving health-related queries, comparing it to state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o and a RAG-only baseline. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces hallucination rates and improves answer completeness and reasoning accuracy. The results underscore the potential of combining RAG, KGs, and multi-agent systems to create intelligent, adaptable systems capable of real-time knowledge integration and reasoning in complex domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taxonomic Reasoning for Rare Arthropods: Combining Dense Image Captioning and RAG for Interpretable Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10886v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of pressing climate change challenges and the significant biodiversity loss among arthropods, automated taxonomic classification from organismal images is a subject of intense research. However, traditional AI pipelines based on deep neural visual architectures such as CNNs or ViTs face limitations such as degraded performance on the long-tail of classes and the inability to reason about their predictions. We integrate image captioning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) to enhance biodiversity monitoring, showing particular promise for characterizing rare and unknown arthropod species. While a naive Vision-Language Model (VLM) excels in classifying images of common species, the RAG model enables classification of rarer taxa by matching explicit textual descriptions of taxonomic features to contextual biodiversity text data from external sources. The RAG model shows promise in reducing overconfidence and enhancing accuracy relative to naive LLMs, suggesting its viability in capturing the nuances of taxonomic hierarchy, particularly at the challenging family and genus levels. Our findings highlight the potential for modern vision-language AI pipelines to support biodiversity conservation initiatives, emphasizing the role of comprehensive data curation and collaboration with citizen science platforms to improve species identification, unknown species characterization and ultimately inform conservation strategies.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |
| **[ClaimTrust: Propagation Trust Scoring for RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10702v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems has revolutionized large-scale content generation but has also highlighted the challenge of ensuring trustworthiness in retrieved information. This paper introduces ClaimTrust, a propagation-based trust scoring framework that dynamically evaluates the reliability of documents in a RAG system. Using a modified PageRank-inspired algorithm, ClaimTrust propagates trust scores across documents based on relationships derived from extracted factual claims. We preprocess and analyze 814 political news articles from Kaggle's Fake News Detection Dataset to extract 2,173 unique claims and classify 965 meaningful relationships (supporting or contradicting). By representing the dataset as a document graph, ClaimTrust iteratively updates trust scores until convergence, effectively differentiating trustworthy articles from unreliable ones. Our methodology, which leverages embedding-based filtering for efficient claim comparison and relationship classification, achieves a 11.2% of significant connections while maintaining computational scalability. Experimental results demonstrate that ClaimTrust successfully assigns higher trust scores to verified documents while penalizing those containing false information. Future directions include fine-tuned claim extract and compare (Li et al., 2022), parameter optimization, enhanced language model utilization, and robust evaluation metrics to generalize the framework across diverse datasets and domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Balancing Content Size in RAG-Text2SQL System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15723v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising solution for converting natural language queries into SQL commands, enabling seamless database interaction. However, these Text-to-SQL (Text2SQL) systems face inherent limitations, hallucinations, outdated knowledge, and untraceable reasoning. To address these challenges, the integration of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with Text2SQL models has gained traction. RAG serves as a retrieval mechanism, providing essential contextual information, such as table schemas and metadata, to enhance the query generation process. Despite their potential, RAG + Text2SQL systems are susceptible to the quality and size of retrieved documents. While richer document content can improve schema relevance and retrieval accuracy, it also introduces noise, increasing the risk of hallucinations and reducing query fidelity as the prompt size of the Text2SQL model increases. This research investigates the nuanced trade-off between document size and quality, aiming to strike a balance that optimizes system performance. Key thresholds are identified where performance degradation occurs, along with actionable strategies to mitigate these challenges. Additionally, we explore the phenomenon of hallucinations in Text2SQL models, emphasizing the critical role of curated document presentation in minimizing errors. Our findings provide a roadmap for enhancing the robustness of RAG + Text2SQL systems, offering practical insights for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

To effectively assess their video comprehension capabilities, long video understanding benchmarks, such as Video-MME and MLVU, are proposed. However, these benchmarks directly use uniform frame sampling for testing, which results in significant information loss and affects the accuracy of the evaluations in reflecting the true abilities of MLLMs. To address this, we propose RAG-Adapter, a plug-and-play framework that reduces information loss during testing by sampling frames most relevant to the given question. Additionally, we introduce a Grouped-supervised Contrastive Learning (GCL) method to further enhance sampling effectiveness of RAG-Adapter through fine-tuning on our constructed MMAT dataset. Finally, we test numerous baseline MLLMs on various video understanding benchmarks, finding that RAG-Adapter sampling consistently outperforms uniform sampling (e.g., Accuracy of GPT-4o increases by 9.3 percent on Video-MME), providing a more accurate testing method for long video benchmarks.</p></details> | 37 pages, 36 figures |

Predictive maintenance (PdM) in such settings demands methodologies that are adaptive, transferable, and capable of integrating domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we present RAAD-LLM, a novel framework for adaptive anomaly detection, leveraging large language models (LLMs) integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This approach addresses the aforementioned PdM challenges. By effectively utilizing domain-specific knowledge, RAAD-LLM enhances the detection of anomalies in time series data without requiring fine-tuning on specific datasets. The framework's adaptability mechanism enables it to adjust its understanding of normal operating conditions dynamically, thus increasing detection accuracy. We validate this methodology through a real-world application for a plastics manufacturing plant and the Skoltech Anomaly Benchmark (SKAB). Results show significant improvements over our previous model with an accuracy increase from 70.7% to 88.6% on the real-world dataset. By allowing for the enriching of input series data with semantics, RAAD-LLM incorporates multimodal capabilities that facilitate more collaborative decision-making between the model and plant operators. Overall, our findings support RAAD-LLM's ability to revolutionize anomaly detection methodologies in PdM, potentially leading to a paradigm shift in how anomaly detection is implemented across various industries.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2411.00914</p></details> |

To bridge this gap, we introduce OpenRAG, a RAG framework that is optimized end-to-end by tuning the retriever to capture in-context relevance, enabling adaptation to the diverse and evolving needs. Extensive experiments across a wide range of tasks demonstrate that OpenRAG, by tuning a retriever end-to-end, leads to a consistent improvement of 4.0% over the original retriever, consistently outperforming existing state-of-the-art retrievers by 2.1%. Additionally, our results indicate that for some tasks, an end-to-end tuned 0.2B retriever can achieve improvements that surpass those of RAG-oriented or instruction-tuned 8B large language models (LLMs), highlighting the cost-effectiveness of our approach in enhancing RAG systems.</p></details> |  |

As an essential part of RAG, external knowledge bases are commonly built by extracting structured data from unstructured PDF documents using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However, given the imperfect prediction of OCR and the inherent non-uniform representation of structured data, knowledge bases inevitably contain various OCR noises. In this paper, we introduce OHRBench, the first benchmark for understanding the cascading impact of OCR on RAG systems. OHRBench includes 8,561 carefully selected unstructured document images from seven real-world RAG application domains, along with 8,498 Q&A pairs derived from multimodal elements in documents, challenging existing OCR solutions used for RAG. To better understand OCR's impact on RAG systems, we identify two primary types of OCR noise: Semantic Noise and Formatting Noise and apply perturbation to generate a set of structured data with varying degrees of each OCR noise. Using OHRBench, we first conduct a comprehensive evaluation of current OCR solutions and reveal that none is competent for constructing high-quality knowledge bases for RAG systems. We then systematically evaluate the impact of these two noise types and demonstrate the trend relationship between the degree of OCR noise and RAG performance. Our OHRBench, including PDF documents, Q&As, and the ground truth structured data are released at: https://github.com/opendatalab/OHR-Bench</p></details> | Work in progress |

We demonstrate that RAG systems that operate on databases with untrusted content are vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks we call jamming. An adversary can add a single ``blocker'' document to the database that will be retrieved in response to a specific query and result in the RAG system not answering this query, ostensibly because it lacks relevant information or because the answer is unsafe. We describe and measure the efficacy of several methods for generating blocker documents, including a new method based on black-box optimization. Our method (1) does not rely on instruction injection, (2) does not require the adversary to know the embedding or LLM used by the target RAG system, and (3) does not employ an auxiliary LLM. We evaluate jamming attacks on several embeddings and LLMs and demonstrate that the existing safety metrics for LLMs do not capture their vulnerability to jamming. We then discuss defenses against blocker documents.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in USENIX Security Symposium 2025</p></details> |

However, the specialized nature of biochemical data often necessitates costly domain-specific fine-tuning, posing critical challenges. First, it hinders the application of more flexible general-purpose LLMs in cutting-edge drug discovery tasks. More importantly, it impedes the rapid integration of the vast amounts of scientific data continuously generated through experiments and research. To investigate these challenges, we propose CLADD, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-empowered agentic system tailored to drug discovery tasks. Through the collaboration of multiple LLM agents, CLADD dynamically retrieves information from biomedical knowledge bases, contextualizes query molecules, and integrates relevant evidence to generate responses -- all without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. Crucially, we tackle key obstacles in applying RAG workflows to biochemical data, including data heterogeneity, ambiguity, and multi-source integration. We demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of this framework across a variety of drug discovery tasks, showing that it outperforms general-purpose and domain-specific LLMs as well as traditional deep learning approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Machi...</summary><p>Machine Learning, Drug Discovery</p></details> |

However, these modules are usually separately trained. We argue that a system like RAG that incorporates multiple modules should be jointly optimized to achieve optimal performance. To demonstrate this, we design a specific pipeline called \textbf{SmartRAG} that includes a policy network and a retriever. The policy network can serve as 1) a decision maker that decides when to retrieve, 2) a query rewriter to generate a query most suited to the retriever, and 3) an answer generator that produces the final response with/without the observations. We then propose to jointly optimize the whole system using a reinforcement learning algorithm, with the reward designed to encourage the system to achieve the best performance with minimal retrieval cost. When jointly optimized, all the modules can be aware of how other modules are working and thus find the best way to work together as a complete system. Empirical results demonstrate that the jointly optimized SmartRAG can achieve better performance than separately optimized counterparts.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution to enhance LLMs accuracy by incorporating external knowledge. However, traditional RAG systems struggle with processing complex relational information and multi-step reasoning, limiting their effectiveness in advanced problem-solving tasks. To address these limitations, we propose CogGRAG, a cognition inspired graph-based RAG framework, designed to improve LLMs performance in Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA). Inspired by the human cognitive process of decomposing complex problems and performing self-verification, our framework introduces a three-stage methodology: decomposition, retrieval, and reasoning with self-verification. By integrating these components, CogGRAG enhances the accuracy of LLMs in complex problem solving. We conduct systematic experiments with three LLM backbones on four benchmark datasets, where CogGRAG outperforms the baselines.</p></details> |  |

While RAG enhances MLLMs by grounding responses in query-relevant external knowledge, this reliance poses a critical yet underexplored safety risk: knowledge poisoning attacks, where misinformation or irrelevant knowledge is intentionally injected into external knowledge bases to manipulate model outputs to be incorrect and even harmful. To expose such vulnerabilities in multimodal RAG, we propose MM-PoisonRAG, a novel knowledge poisoning attack framework with two attack strategies: Localized Poisoning Attack (LPA), which injects query-specific misinformation in both text and images for targeted manipulation, and Globalized Poisoning Attack (GPA) to provide false guidance during MLLM generation to elicit nonsensical responses across all queries. We evaluate our attacks across multiple tasks, models, and access settings, demonstrating that LPA successfully manipulates the MLLM to generate attacker-controlled answers, with a success rate of up to 56% on MultiModalQA. Moreover, GPA completely disrupts model generation to 0% accuracy with just a single irrelevant knowledge injection. Our results highlight the urgent need for robust defenses against knowledge poisoning to safeguard multimodal RAG frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/HyeonjeongHa/MM-PoisonRAG</p></details> |

Although these speech act indicators communicate the user\textquotesingle s intent -- whether it is asking a question, making a request, or stating a fact -- they do not necessarily add to the core informational content of the query itself. This paper investigates whether extracting the underlying propositional content from user utterances -- essentially stripping away the linguistic markers of intent -- can improve retrieval quality in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Drawing upon foundational insights from speech act theory, we propose a practical method for automatically transforming queries into their propositional equivalents before embedding. To assess the efficacy of this approach, we conducted an experimental study involving 63 user queries related to a Brazilian telecommunications news corpus with precomputed semantic embeddings. Results demonstrate clear improvements in semantic similarity between query embeddings and document embeddings at top ranks, confirming that queries stripped of speech act indicators more effectively retrieve relevant content.</p></details> | 19 pages, 4 figures |

Built from heterologous data of NASDAQ 100 companies, FinTMMBench offers three significant advantages. 1) Multi-modal Corpus: It encompasses a hybrid of financial tables, news articles, daily stock prices, and visual technical charts as the corpus. 2) Temporal-aware Questions: Each question requires the retrieval and interpretation of its relevant data over a specific time period, including daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual periods. 3) Diverse Financial Analysis Tasks: The questions involve 10 different tasks, including information extraction, trend analysis, sentiment analysis and event detection, etc. We further propose a novel TMMHybridRAG method, which first leverages LLMs to convert data from other modalities (e.g., tabular, visual and time-series data) into textual format and then incorporates temporal information in each node when constructing graphs and dense indexes. Its effectiveness has been validated in extensive experiments, but notable gaps remain, highlighting the challenges presented by our FinTMMBench.</p></details> | Under review |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) fetches evidence via similarity search, but key information may fall outside top ranked results. Long-context models can process multiple documents but are computationally expensive and limited by context window size. Inspired by students condensing study material for open-book exams, we propose task-aware key-value (KV) cache compression, which compresses external knowledge in a zero- or few-shot setup. This enables LLMs to reason efficiently over a compacted representation of all relevant information. Experiments show our approach outperforms both RAG and task-agnostic compression methods. On LongBench v2, it improves accuracy by up to 7 absolute points over RAG with a 30x compression rate, while reducing inference latency from 0.43s to 0.16s. A synthetic dataset highlights that RAG performs well when sparse evidence suffices, whereas task-aware compression is superior for broad knowledge tasks.</p></details> |  |

Although previous studies noted that retrieving many documents can degrade performance, they did not isolate how the quantity of documents affects performance while controlling for context length. We evaluate various language models on custom datasets derived from a multi-hop QA task. We keep the context length and position of relevant information constant while varying the number of documents, and find that increasing the document count in RAG settings poses significant challenges for LLMs. Additionally, our results indicate that processing multiple documents is a separate challenge from handling long contexts. We also make the datasets and code available: https://github.com/shaharl6000/MoreDocsSameLen .</p></details> | Preprint |

A number of graph-based RAG methods have been proposed in the literature. However, these methods have not been systematically and comprehensively compared under the same experimental settings. In this paper, we first summarize a unified framework to incorporate all graph-based RAG methods from a high-level perspective. We then extensively compare representative graph-based RAG methods over a range of questing-answering (QA) datasets -- from specific questions to abstract questions -- and examine the effectiveness of all methods, providing a thorough analysis of graph-based RAG approaches. As a byproduct of our experimental analysis, we are also able to identify new variants of the graph-based RAG methods over specific QA and abstract QA tasks respectively, by combining existing techniques, which outperform the state-of-the-art methods. Finally, based on these findings, we offer promising research opportunities. We believe that a deeper understanding of the behavior of existing methods can provide new valuable insights for future research.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers an effective method for achieving this by retrieving the most relevant fragments into LLMs. However, the advancements in context window size for LLMs offer an alternative approach, raising the question of whether RAG remains necessary for effectively handling external knowledge. Several existing studies provide inconclusive comparisons between RAG and long-context (LC) LLMs, largely due to limitations in the benchmark designs. In this paper, we present LaRA, a novel benchmark specifically designed to rigorously compare RAG and LC LLMs. LaRA encompasses 2326 test cases across four practical QA task categories and three types of naturally occurring long texts. Through systematic evaluation of seven open-source and four proprietary LLMs, we find that the optimal choice between RAG and LC depends on a complex interplay of factors, including the model's parameter size, long-text capabilities, context length, task type, and the characteristics of the retrieved chunks. Our findings provide actionable guidelines for practitioners to effectively leverage both RAG and LC approaches in developing and deploying LLM applications.

While many studies focus on evaluating the overall quality of end-to-end RAG systems, there is a gap in understanding the appropriateness of LLMs for the RAG task. To address this, we introduce Trust-Score, a holistic metric that evaluates the trustworthiness of LLMs within the RAG framework. Our results show that various prompting methods, such as in-context learning, fail to effectively adapt LLMs to the RAG task as measured by Trust-Score. Consequently, we propose Trust-Align, a method to align LLMs for improved Trust-Score performance. 26 out of 27 models aligned using Trust-Align substantially outperform competitive baselines on ASQA, QAMPARI, and ELI5. Specifically, in LLaMA-3-8b, Trust-Align outperforms FRONT on ASQA (up 12.56), QAMPARI (up 36.04), and ELI5 (up 17.69). Trust-Align also significantly enhances models' ability to correctly refuse and provide quality citations. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of Trust-Align across different open-weight models, including the LLaMA series (1b to 8b), Qwen-2.5 series (0.5b to 7b), and Phi3.5 (3.8b). We release our code at https://github.com/declare-lab/trust-align.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |

However, evaluating the effectiveness of RAG systems in specialized scenarios remains challenging due to the high costs of data construction and the lack of suitable evaluation metrics. This paper introduces RAGEval, a framework designed to assess RAG systems across diverse scenarios by generating high-quality documents, questions, answers, and references through a schema-based pipeline. With a focus on factual accuracy, we propose three novel metrics: Completeness, Hallucination, and Irrelevance to evaluate LLM generated responses rigorously. Experimental results show that RAGEval outperforms zero-shot and one-shot methods in terms of clarity, safety, conformity, and richness of generated samples. Furthermore, the use of LLMs for scoring the proposed metrics demonstrates a high level of consistency with human evaluations. RAGEval establishes a new paradigm for evaluating RAG systems in real-world applications.

| **[SAGE: A Framework of Precise Retrieval for RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01713v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated significant proficiency in conducting question-answering (QA) tasks within a specified corpus. Nonetheless, numerous failure instances of RAG in QA still exist. These failures are not solely attributable to the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs); instead, they predominantly arise from the retrieval of inaccurate information for LLMs due to two limitations: (1) Current RAG methods segment the corpus without considering semantics, making it difficult to find relevant context due to impaired correlation between questions and the segments. (2) There is a trade-off between missing essential context with fewer context retrieved and getting irrelevant context with more context retrieved. In this paper, we introduce a RAG framework (SAGE), to overcome these limitations. First, to address the segmentation issue without considering semantics, we propose to train a semantic segmentation model. This model is trained to segment the corpus into semantically complete chunks. Second, to ensure that only the most relevant chunks are retrieved while the irrelevant ones are ignored, we design a chunk selection algorithm to dynamically select chunks based on the decreasing speed of the relevance score, leading to a more relevant selection. Third, to further ensure the precision of the retrieved chunks, we propose letting LLMs assess whether retrieved chunks are excessive or lacking and then adjust the amount of context accordingly. Experiments show that SAGE outperforms baselines by 61.25% in the quality of QA on average. Moreover, by avoiding retrieving noisy context, SAGE lowers the cost of the tokens consumed in LLM inference and achieves a 49.41% enhancement in cost efficiency on average. Additionally, our work offers valuable insights for boosting RAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retrieval-Augmented Perception: High-Resolution Image Perception Meets Visual RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01222v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-resolution (HR) image perception remains a key challenge in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To overcome the limitations of existing methods, this paper shifts away from prior dedicated heuristic approaches and revisits the most fundamental idea to HR perception by enhancing the long-context capability of MLLMs, driven by recent advances in long-context techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for general LLMs. Towards this end, this paper presents the first study exploring the use of RAG to address HR perception challenges. Specifically, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Perception (RAP), a training-free framework that retrieves and fuses relevant image crops while preserving spatial context using the proposed Spatial-Awareness Layout. To accommodate different tasks, the proposed Retrieved-Exploration Search (RE-Search) dynamically selects the optimal number of crops based on model confidence and retrieval scores. Experimental results on HR benchmarks demonstrate the significant effectiveness of RAP, with LLaVA-v1.5-13B achieving a 43% improvement on $V^*$ Bench and 19% on HR-Bench.</p></details> |  |
| **[MMed-RAG: Versatile Multimodal RAG System for Medical Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13085v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated significant potential in healthcare, particularly in disease diagnosis and treatment planning. Recent progress in Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) has opened up new possibilities for interactive diagnostic tools. However, these models often suffer from factual hallucination, which can lead to incorrect diagnoses. Fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have emerged as methods to address these issues. However, the amount of high-quality data and distribution shifts between training data and deployment data limit the application of fine-tuning methods. Although RAG is lightweight and effective, existing RAG-based approaches are not sufficiently general to different medical domains and can potentially cause misalignment issues, both between modalities and between the model and the ground truth. In this paper, we propose a versatile multimodal RAG system, MMed-RAG, designed to enhance the factuality of Med-LVLMs. Our approach introduces a domain-aware retrieval mechanism, an adaptive retrieved contexts selection method, and a provable RAG-based preference fine-tuning strategy. These innovations make the RAG process sufficiently general and reliable, significantly improving alignment when introducing retrieved contexts. Experimental results across five medical datasets (involving radiology, ophthalmology, pathology) on medical VQA and report generation demonstrate that MMed-RAG can achieve an average improvement of 43.8% in the factual accuracy of Med-LVLMs. Our data and code are available in https://github.com/richard-peng-xia/MMed-RAG.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

In this paper, we propose a generative AI-powered GATE question-answering framework (GATE stands for Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering) that leverages LLMs to explain GATE solutions and support students in their exam preparation. We conducted extensive benchmarking to select the optimal embedding model and LLM, evaluating our framework based on criteria such as latency, faithfulness, and relevance, with additional validation through human evaluation. Our chatbot integrates state-of-the-art embedding models and LLMs to deliver accurate, context-aware responses. Through rigorous experimentation, we identified configurations that balance performance and computational efficiency, ensuring a reliable chatbot to serve students' needs. Additionally, we discuss the challenges faced in data processing and modeling and implemented solutions. Our work explores the application of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for GATE Q/A explanation tasks, and our findings demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and response quality. This research offers practical insights for developing effective AI-driven educational tools while highlighting areas for future enhancement in usability and scalability.</p></details> |  |

Train on Self-Generated Demonstrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10596v2)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with knowledge intensive NLP tasks, such as answering "Who won the latest World Cup?" because the knowledge they learn during training may be insufficient or outdated. Conditioning generation on retrieved documents -- a technique known as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) -- mitigates these shortcomings by allowing the model to leverage in-context information. Practitioners can improve LLM RAG performance by fine-tuning on retrieval-augmented instructions, but must beware that this can cause undesirable model behaviors like hallucinations. We attribute this degradation to the fact that the training data is likely to be out-of-distribution for the model and may suffer from quality issues, such as misalignment between retrievals and target responses (since retrievals are frequently added post-hoc). We propose a recipe for training RAG-enabled LLMs using self-generated demonstrations, thereby avoiding training on out-of-distribution text and integrating retrievals into the LLM responses. We evaluate our method on knowledge intensive question answering (QA) tasks and show that our method teaches LLMs to properly handle in-context retrievals and abstain from questions it will likely get wrong. Compared to conventional RA-IT methods, our method prevents model degradation in non-RAG settings while exhibiting superior QA performance.</p></details> |  |

To address the fragmented evaluation paradigms and limited cases in existing Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH), this paper introduces U-NIAH, a unified framework that systematically compares LLMs and RAG methods in controlled long context settings. Our framework extends beyond traditional NIAH by incorporating multi-needle, long-needle, and needle-in-needle configurations, along with different retrieval settings, while leveraging the synthetic Starlight Academy dataset-a fictional magical universe-to eliminate biases from pre-trained knowledge. Through extensive experiments, we investigate three research questions: (1) performance trade-offs between LLMs and RAG, (2) error patterns in RAG, and (3) RAG's limitations in complex settings. Our findings show that RAG significantly enhances smaller LLMs by mitigating the "lost-in-the-middle" effect and improving robustness, achieving an 82.58% win-rate over LLMs. However, we observe that retrieval noise and reverse chunk ordering degrade performance, while surprisingly, advanced reasoning LLMs exhibit reduced RAG compatibility due to sensitivity to semantic distractors. We identify typical error patterns including omission due to noise, hallucination under high noise critical condition, and self-doubt behaviors. Our work not only highlights the complementary roles of RAG and LLMs, but also provides actionable insights for optimizing deployments.

However, these models face challenges in retrieving precise information from vast datasets. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) was developed to combining LLMs with external information retrieval systems to enhance the accuracy and context of responses. Despite improvements, RAG still struggles with comprehensive retrieval in high-volume, low-information-density databases and lacks relational awareness, leading to fragmented answers. To address this, this paper introduces the Pseudo-Knowledge Graph (PKG) framework, designed to overcome these limitations by integrating Meta-path Retrieval, In-graph Text and Vector Retrieval into LLMs. By preserving natural language text and leveraging various retrieval techniques, the PKG offers a richer knowledge representation and improves accuracy in information retrieval. Extensive evaluations using Open Compass and MultiHop-RAG benchmarks demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in managing large volumes of data and complex relationships.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods rely on unrealistic white-box assumptions, such as attackers having access to RAG systems' internal processes. To address this issue, we introduce a realistic black-box attack scenario based on the RAG paradox, where RAG systems inadvertently expose vulnerabilities while attempting to enhance trustworthiness. Because RAG systems reference external documents during response generation, our attack targets these sources without requiring internal access. Our approach first identifies the external sources disclosed by RAG systems and then automatically generates poisoned documents with misinformation designed to match these sources. Finally, these poisoned documents are newly published on the disclosed sources, disrupting the RAG system's response generation process. Both offline and online experiments confirm that this attack significantly reduces RAG performance without requiring internal access. Furthermore, from an insider perspective within the RAG system, we propose a re-ranking method that acts as a fundamental safeguard, offering minimal protection against unforeseen attacks.</p></details> |  |

Different from traditional RAG methods that mostly deal with flat text chunks, the proposed method takes into account the relationship of multimodalities by using a graph structure. To do that, a graph modeling structure is defined based on document layout parsing. The structure of an input document is retained with the connection of text chunks, tables, and figures. This representation allows the method to handle complex questions that require information from multimodalities. To confirm the efficiency of the graph modeling, a flexible RAG pipeline is developed using robust components. Experimental results on four benchmark test sets confirm the contribution of the layout-aware modeling for performance improvement of the RAG pipeline.</p></details> | <details><summary>NAACL...</summary><p>NAACL 2025, Industry Track</p></details> |

Recent RAG advancements focus on improving retrieval outcomes through iterative LLM refinement or self-critique capabilities acquired through additional instruction tuning of LLMs. In this work, we introduce Speculative RAG - a framework that leverages a larger generalist LM to efficiently verify multiple RAG drafts produced in parallel by a smaller, distilled specialist LM. Each draft is generated from a distinct subset of retrieved documents, offering diverse perspectives on the evidence while reducing input token counts per draft. This approach enhances comprehension of each subset and mitigates potential position bias over long context. Our method accelerates RAG by delegating drafting to the smaller specialist LM, with the larger generalist LM performing a single verification pass over the drafts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Speculative RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance with reduced latency on TriviaQA, MuSiQue, PopQA, PubHealth, and ARC-Challenge benchmarks. It notably enhances accuracy by up to 12.97% while reducing latency by 50.83% compared to conventional RAG systems on PubHealth.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Biomedical code mapping identifies similarity or equivalence between concepts from different ontologies. Obtaining high-quality mapping usually relies on automatic generation of unrefined mapping with ontology domain fine-tuned language models (LMs), followed by manual selections or corrections by coding experts who have extensive domain expertise and familiarity with ontology schemas. The LMs usually provide unrefined code mapping suggestions as a list of candidates without reasoning or supporting evidence, hence coding experts still need to verify each suggested candidate against ontology sources to pick the best matches. This is also a recurring task as ontology sources are updated regularly to incorporate new research findings. Consequently, the need of regular LM retraining and manual refinement make code mapping time-consuming and labour intensive. In this work, we created OntologyRAG, an ontology-enhanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method that leverages the inductive biases from ontological knowledge graphs for in-context-learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs). Our solution grounds LLMs to knowledge graphs with unrefined mappings between ontologies and processes questions by generating an interpretable set of results that include prediction rational with mapping proximity assessment. Our solution doesn't require re-training LMs, as all ontology updates could be reflected by updating the knowledge graphs with a standard process. Evaluation results on a self-curated gold dataset show promises of using our method to enable coding experts to achieve better and faster code mapping.

This includes the LLM, embedding, and ranker models themselves, as well as hyperparameters governing individual RAG components. Yet, collectively optimizing the entire configuration in a RAG or LLM system remains under-explored - especially in multi-objective settings - due to intractably large solution spaces, noisy objective evaluations, and the high cost of evaluations. In this work, we introduce the first approach for multi-objective parameter optimization of cost, latency, safety and alignment over entire LLM and RAG systems. We find that Bayesian optimization methods significantly outperform baseline approaches, obtaining a superior Pareto front on two new RAG benchmark tasks. We conclude our work with important considerations for practitioners who are designing multi-objective RAG systems, highlighting nuances such as how optimal configurations may not generalize across tasks and objectives.</p></details> |  |

The challenge of detecting such unauthorized usage remains underexplored, with datasets and methods from adjacent fields being ill-suited for its study. We take several steps to bridge this gap. First, we formalize this problem as (black-box) RAG Dataset Inference (RAG-DI). We then introduce a novel dataset designed for realistic benchmarking of RAG-DI methods, alongside a set of baselines. Finally, we propose Ward, a method for RAG-DI based on LLM watermarks that equips data owners with rigorous statistical guarantees regarding their dataset's misuse in RAG corpora. Ward consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving higher accuracy, superior query efficiency and robustness. Our work provides a foundation for future studies of RAG-DI and highlights LLM watermarks as a promising approach to this problem.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Yet, most existing work in RAG has underemphasized fair ranking techniques and neglected the diverse interests of all stakeholders. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of RAG systems that incorporate fairness-aware rankings, focusing on both ranking fairness and attribution fairness - ensuring equitable exposure of sources cited in the final text. We specifically examine item-side fairness, i.e., whether retrieved documents receive balanced exposure, and assess how this affects both the system's overall performance and the eventual distribution of cited sources. Across twelve RAG models and seven tasks, we find that fairness-aware retrieval frequently retains or even improves ranking effectiveness and generation quality, countering the widespread belief that fairness compromises system performance. Moreover, we show that fair retrieval leads to more balanced attribution in the final responses, ensuring that the cited sources are credited more equitably. Our results underscore the importance of item-side fairness throughout both retrieval and generation phases, offering key insights for building more responsible and equitable RAG systems and illustrating promising avenues for future exploration in fair ranking and source attribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Top 5...</summary><p>Top 5 Spotlight at AFME Workshop at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating the Effectiveness and Efficiency of Demonstration Retrievers in RAG for Coding Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09662v2)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge bases, achieving state-of-the-art results in various coding tasks. The core of RAG is retrieving demonstration examples, which is essential to balance effectiveness (generation quality) and efficiency (retrieval time) for optimal performance. However, the high-dimensional nature of code representations and large knowledge bases often create efficiency bottlenecks, which are overlooked in previous research. This paper systematically evaluates the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off of retrievers across three coding tasks: Program Synthesis, Commit Message Generation, and Assertion Generation. We examined six retrievers: two sparse (BM25 and BM25L) and four dense retrievers, including one exhaustive dense retriever (SBERT's Semantic Search) and three approximate dense retrievers (ANNOY, LSH, and HNSW). Our findings show that while BM25 excels in effectiveness, it suffers in efficiency as the knowledge base grows beyond 1000 entries. In large-scale retrieval, efficiency differences become more pronounced, with approximate dense retrievers offering the greatest gains. For instance, in Commit Generation task, HNSW achieves a 44x speed up, while only with a 1.74% drop in RougeL compared with BM25. Our results also show that increasing the number of demonstrations in the prompt doesn't always improve the effectiveness and can increase latency and lead to incorrect outputs. Our findings provide valuable insights for practitioners aiming to build efficient and effective RAG systems for coding tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables, accepted by SANER 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we study the conflict between biases of each component and their relationship to the overall bias of the RAG system, which we call bias conflict. Examining both gender and political biases as case studies, we show that bias conflict can be characterized through a linear relationship among components despite its complexity in 6 different LLMs. Through comprehensive fine-tuning experiments creating 120 differently biased embedders, we demonstrate how to control bias while maintaining utility and reveal the importance of reverse-biasing the embedder to mitigate bias in the overall system. Additionally, we find that LLMs and tasks exhibit varying sensitivities to the embedder bias, a crucial factor to consider for debiasing. Our results underscore that a fair RAG system can be better achieved by carefully controlling the bias of the embedder rather than increasing its fairness.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages (8 main), 12 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

We present LettuceDetect a framework that addresses two critical limitations in existing hallucination detection methods: (1) the context window constraints of traditional encoder-based methods, and (2) the computational inefficiency of LLM based approaches. Building on ModernBERT's extended context capabilities (up to 8k tokens) and trained on the RAGTruth benchmark dataset, our approach outperforms all previous encoder-based models and most prompt-based models, while being approximately 30 times smaller than the best models. LettuceDetect is a token-classification model that processes context-question-answer triples, allowing for the identification of unsupported claims at the token level. Evaluations on the RAGTruth corpus demonstrate an F1 score of 79.22% for example-level detection, which is a 14.8% improvement over Luna, the previous state-of-the-art encoder-based architecture. Additionally, the system can process 30 to 60 examples per second on a single GPU, making it more practical for real-world RAG applications.</p></details> | 6 pages |
| **[Don't Do RAG: When Cache-Augmented Generation is All You Need for Knowledge Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15605v2)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has gained traction as a powerful approach for enhancing language models by integrating external knowledge sources. However, RAG introduces challenges such as retrieval latency, potential errors in document selection, and increased system complexity. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) featuring significantly extended context windows, this paper proposes an alternative paradigm, cache-augmented generation (CAG) that bypasses real-time retrieval. Our method involves preloading all relevant resources, especially when the documents or knowledge for retrieval are of a limited and manageable size, into the LLM's extended context and caching its runtime parameters. During inference, the model utilizes these preloaded parameters to answer queries without additional retrieval steps. Comparative analyses reveal that CAG eliminates retrieval latency and minimizes retrieval errors while maintaining context relevance. Performance evaluations across multiple benchmarks highlight scenarios where long-context LLMs either outperform or complement traditional RAG pipelines. These findings suggest that, for certain applications, particularly those with a constrained knowledge base, CAG provide a streamlined and efficient alternative to RAG, achieving comparable or superior results with reduced complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, accepted by the Web Conference 2025 (WWW '25) as a short paper</p></details> |
| **[Worse than Zero-shot? A Fact-Checking Dataset for Evaluating the Robustness of RAG Against Misleading Retrievals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16101v1)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has shown impressive capabilities in mitigating hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs struggle to handle misleading retrievals and often fail to maintain their own reasoning when exposed to conflicting or selectively-framed evidence, making them vulnerable to real-world misinformation. In such real-world retrieval scenarios, misleading and conflicting information is rampant, particularly in the political domain, where evidence is often selectively framed, incomplete, or polarized. However, existing RAG benchmarks largely assume a clean retrieval setting, where models succeed by accurately retrieving and generating answers from gold-standard documents. This assumption fails to align with real-world conditions, leading to an overestimation of RAG system performance. To bridge this gap, we introduce RAGuard, a fact-checking dataset designed to evaluate the robustness of RAG systems against misleading retrievals. Unlike prior benchmarks that rely on synthetic noise, our dataset constructs its retrieval corpus from Reddit discussions, capturing naturally occurring misinformation. It categorizes retrieved evidence into three types: supporting, misleading, and irrelevant, providing a realistic and challenging testbed for assessing how well RAG systems navigate different retrieval information. Our benchmark experiments reveal that when exposed to misleading retrievals, all tested LLM-powered RAG systems perform worse than their zero-shot baselines (i.e., no retrieval at all), highlighting their susceptibility to noisy environments. To the best of our knowledge, RAGuard is the first benchmark to systematically assess RAG robustness against misleading evidence. We expect this benchmark will drive future research toward improving RAG systems beyond idealized datasets, making them more reliable for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

However, due to access restrictions, Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot retrieve these internal documents, limiting their ability to generate accurate zero-shot responses. To overcome this limitation, we use a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework powered by a Knowledge Graph (KG) to retrieve relevant information from external knowledge sources, enabling LLMs to answer questions over private or previously unseen document collections. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for building a high-quality, low-noise KG. We apply several techniques, including incremental entity resolution using seed concepts, similarity-based filtering to deduplicate entries, assigning confidence scores to entity-relation pairs to filter for high-confidence pairs, and linking facts to source documents for provenance. Our KG-RAG system retrieves relevant tuples, which are added to the user prompts context before being sent to the LLM generating the response. Our evaluation demonstrates that this approach significantly enhances response relevance, reducing irrelevant answers by over 50% and increasing fully relevant answers by 88% compared to the existing production system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain-of-Rank: Enhancing Large Language Models for Domain-Specific RAG in Edge Device](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15134v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) is especially valuable in specialized domains, where precision is critical. To more specialize the LLMs into a target domain, domain-specific RAG has recently been developed by allowing the LLM to access the target domain early via finetuning. The domain-specific RAG makes more sense in resource-constrained environments like edge devices, as they should perform a specific task (e.g. personalization) reliably using only small-scale LLMs. While the domain-specific RAG is well-aligned with edge devices in this respect, it often relies on widely-used reasoning techniques like chain-of-thought (CoT). The reasoning step is useful to understand the given external knowledge, and yet it is computationally expensive and difficult for small-scale LLMs to learn it. Tackling this, we propose the Chain of Rank (CoR) which shifts the focus from intricate lengthy reasoning to simple ranking of the reliability of input external documents. Then, CoR reduces computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy, making it particularly suited for resource-constrained environments. We attain the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in benchmarks, and analyze its efficacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>NAACL...</summary><p>NAACL 2025 (Findings)</p></details> |

Different from a standard retrieval task's objective of maximising the relevance of a set of top-ranked documents, a RAG system's objective is rather to maximise their total utility, where the utility of a document indicates whether including it as a part of the additional contextual information in an LLM prompt improves a downstream task. Existing studies investigate the role of the relevance of a RAG context for knowledge-intensive language tasks (KILT), where relevance essentially takes the form of answer containment. In contrast, in our work, relevance corresponds to that of topical overlap between a query and a document for an information seeking task. Specifically, we make use of an IR test collection to empirically investigate whether a RAG context comprised of topically relevant documents leads to improved downstream performance. Our experiments lead to the following findings: (a) there is a small positive correlation between relevance and utility; (b) this correlation decreases with increasing context sizes (higher values of k in k-shot); and (c) a more effective retrieval model generally leads to better downstream RAG performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages (including reference), 5 figures, 1 table, 48 references; this paper has been accepted by ECIR'25 as a full paper</p></details> |

Our approach combines RAG with Socratic dialogue to align a user's intuitive understanding of research topics with established Knowledge Organization Systems (KOSs). The proposed approach will effectively bridge "little semantics" (domain-specific KOS structures) with "big semantics" (broad bibliometric repositories), making complex academic taxonomies more accessible. Such agents have the potential for broad use. We illustrate with a sample application called CollabNext, which is a person-centric knowledge graph connecting people, organizations, and research topics. We further describe how the application design has an intentional focus on HBCUs and emerging researchers to raise visibility of people historically rendered invisible in the current science system.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, AAAI 2025 Workshop on A Translational Institute for Knowledge Axiomatization</p></details> |

Given the challenges in continual learning with large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become the dominant way to introduce new information. However, its reliance on vector retrieval hinders its ability to mimic the dynamic and interconnected nature of human long-term memory. Recent RAG approaches augment vector embeddings with various structures like knowledge graphs to address some of these gaps, namely sense-making and associativity. However, their performance on more basic factual memory tasks drops considerably below standard RAG. We address this unintended deterioration and propose HippoRAG 2, a framework that outperforms standard RAG comprehensively on factual, sense-making, and associative memory tasks. HippoRAG 2 builds upon the Personalized PageRank algorithm used in HippoRAG and enhances it with deeper passage integration and more effective online use of an LLM. This combination pushes this RAG system closer to the effectiveness of human long-term memory, achieving a 7% improvement in associative memory tasks over the state-of-the-art embedding model while also exhibiting superior factual knowledge and sense-making memory capabilities. This work paves the way for non-parametric continual learning for LLMs. Our code and data will be released at https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/HippoRAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data to be released at: https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/HippoRAG</p></details> |

The application of RAG technology effectively addresses the hallucination problem in content generation. The optimized model shows significant improvements in fluency, accuracy, and relevance of content generation.

However, when the retrieval process involves private data, RAG systems may face severe privacy risks, potentially leading to the leakage of sensitive information. To address this issue, we propose using synthetic data as a privacy-preserving alternative for the retrieval data. We propose SAGE, a novel two-stage synthetic data generation paradigm. In the stage-1, we employ an attribute-based extraction and generation approach to preserve key contextual information from the original data. In the stage-2, we further enhance the privacy properties of the synthetic data through an agent-based iterative refinement process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that using our synthetic data as the retrieval context achieves comparable performance to using the original data while substantially reducing privacy risks. Our work takes the first step towards investigating the possibility of generating high-utility and privacy-preserving synthetic data for RAG, opening up new opportunities for the safe application of RAG systems in various domains.</p></details> |  |

This is critical given existing workforce shortages, especially in marginalized communities like Underrepresented Minorities (URM), who often lack access to quality education. Addressing these challenges, this research presents gAI-PT4I4, a Generative AI-based Personalized Tutor for Industrial 4.0, designed to personalize 4IR experiential learning. gAI-PT4I4 employs sentiment analysis to assess student comprehension, leveraging generative AI and finite automaton to tailor learning experiences. The framework integrates low-fidelity Digital Twins for VR-based training, featuring an Interactive Tutor - a generative AI assistant providing real-time guidance via audio and text. It uses zero-shot sentiment analysis with LLMs and prompt engineering, achieving 86\% accuracy in classifying student-teacher interactions as positive or negative. Additionally, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables personalized learning content grounded in domain-specific knowledge. To adapt training dynamically, finite automaton structures exercises into states of increasing difficulty, requiring 80\% task-performance accuracy for progression. Experimental evaluation with 22 volunteers showed improved accuracy exceeding 80\%, reducing training time. Finally, this paper introduces a Multi-Fidelity Digital Twin model, aligning Digital Twin complexity with Bloom's Taxonomy and Kirkpatrick's model, providing a scalable educational framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Local to Global: A Graph RAG Approach to Query-Focused Summarization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16130v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to retrieve relevant information from an external knowledge source enables large language models (LLMs) to answer questions over private and/or previously unseen document collections. However, RAG fails on global questions directed at an entire text corpus, such as "What are the main themes in the dataset?", since this is inherently a query-focused summarization (QFS) task, rather than an explicit retrieval task. Prior QFS methods, meanwhile, do not scale to the quantities of text indexed by typical RAG systems. To combine the strengths of these contrasting methods, we propose GraphRAG, a graph-based approach to question answering over private text corpora that scales with both the generality of user questions and the quantity of source text. Our approach uses an LLM to build a graph index in two stages: first, to derive an entity knowledge graph from the source documents, then to pregenerate community summaries for all groups of closely related entities. Given a question, each community summary is used to generate a partial response, before all partial responses are again summarized in a final response to the user. For a class of global sensemaking questions over datasets in the 1 million token range, we show that GraphRAG leads to substantial improvements over a conventional RAG baseline for both the comprehensiveness and diversity of generated answers.</p></details> |  |

To comprehensively evaluate the resilience of current RAG methods, we introduce HawkBench, a human-labeled, multi-domain benchmark designed to rigorously assess RAG performance across categorized task types. By stratifying tasks based on information-seeking behaviors, HawkBench provides a systematic evaluation of how well RAG systems adapt to diverse user needs. Unlike existing benchmarks, which focus primarily on specific task types (mostly factoid queries) and rely on varying knowledge bases, HawkBench offers: (1) systematic task stratification to cover a broad range of query types, including both factoid and rationale queries, (2) integration of multi-domain corpora across all task types to mitigate corpus bias, and (3) rigorous annotation for high-quality evaluation. HawkBench includes 1,600 high-quality test samples, evenly distributed across domains and task types. Using this benchmark, we evaluate representative RAG methods, analyzing their performance in terms of answer quality and response latency. Our findings highlight the need for dynamic task strategies that integrate decision-making, query interpretation, and global knowledge understanding to improve RAG generalizability. We believe HawkBench serves as a pivotal benchmark for advancing the resilience of RAG methods and their ability to achieve general-purpose information seeking.</p></details> | 13 pages |

It has been shown to enhance both generation quality and trustworthiness. While numerous works have focused on improving retrieval, generation, and evaluation, the role of reward models in reinforcement learning for optimizing RAG remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{RAG-Reward}, a framework designed to develop reward models to enable \textit{hallucination-free, comprehensive, reliable, and efficient RAG}. We define four key metrics to assess generation quality and develop an automated benchmarking pipeline to evaluate the outputs of multiple LLMs across a variety of RAG scenarios. Using \textbf{RAG-Reward}, we train reward models and apply {reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF)} to improve LLMs' effectiveness in RAG. Experimental results demonstrate that our reward model achieves state-of-the-art performance in automatic benchmarking and aligns closely with human evaluations. Furthermore, the improved generation quality of the trained policy model highlights the feasibility and efficiency of using RLHF to enhance RAG outputs.</p></details> | Preprint |

In this paper, we introduce an omnidirectional and automatic RAG benchmark, OmniEval, in the financial domain. Our benchmark is characterized by its multi-dimensional evaluation framework, including (1) a matrix-based RAG scenario evaluation system that categorizes queries into five task classes and 16 financial topics, leading to a structured assessment of diverse query scenarios; (2) a multi-dimensional evaluation data generation approach, which combines GPT-4-based automatic generation and human annotation, achieving an 87.47\% acceptance ratio in human evaluations on generated instances; (3) a multi-stage evaluation system that evaluates both retrieval and generation performance, result in a comprehensive evaluation on the RAG pipeline; and (4) robust evaluation metrics derived from rule-based and LLM-based ones, enhancing the reliability of assessments through manual annotations and supervised fine-tuning of an LLM evaluator. Our experiments demonstrate the comprehensiveness of OmniEval, which includes extensive test datasets and highlights the performance variations of RAG systems across diverse topics and tasks, revealing significant opportunities for RAG models to improve their capabilities in vertical domains.

| **[Systematic Knowledge Injection into Large Language Models via Diverse Augmentation for Domain-Specific RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08356v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a prominent method for incorporating domain knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs). While RAG enhances response relevance by incorporating retrieved domain knowledge in the context, retrieval errors can still lead to hallucinations and incorrect answers. To recover from retriever failures, domain knowledge is injected by fine-tuning the model to generate the correct response, even in the case of retrieval errors. However, we observe that without systematic knowledge augmentation, fine-tuned LLMs may memorize new information but still fail to extract relevant domain knowledge, leading to poor performance. In this work, we present a novel framework that significantly enhances the fine-tuning process by augmenting the training data in two ways -- context augmentation and knowledge paraphrasing. In context augmentation, we create multiple training samples for a given QA pair by varying the relevance of the retrieved information, teaching the model when to ignore and when to rely on retrieved content. In knowledge paraphrasing, we fine-tune with multiple answers to the same question, enabling LLMs to better internalize specialized knowledge. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting due to fine-tuning, we add a domain-specific identifier to a question and also utilize a replay buffer containing general QA pairs. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our method over existing techniques, achieving up to 10\% relative gain in token-level recall while preserving the LLM's generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 14 tables, to be published in NAACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[Does RAG Really Perform Bad For Long-Context Processing?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11444v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The efficient processing of long context poses a serious challenge for large language models (LLMs). Recently, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising strategy for this problem, as it enables LLMs to make selective use of the long context for efficient computation. However, existing RAG approaches lag behind other long-context processing methods due to inherent limitations on inaccurate retrieval and fragmented contexts. To address these challenges, we introduce RetroLM, a novel RAG framework for long-context processing. Unlike traditional methods, RetroLM employs KV-level retrieval augmentation, where it partitions the LLM's KV cache into contiguous pages and retrieves the most crucial ones for efficient computation. This approach enhances robustness to retrieval inaccuracy, facilitates effective utilization of fragmented contexts, and saves the cost from repeated computation. Building on this framework, we further develop a specialized retriever for precise retrieval of critical pages and conduct unsupervised post-training to optimize the model's ability to leverage retrieved information. We conduct comprehensive evaluations with a variety of benchmarks, including LongBench, InfiniteBench, and RULER, where RetroLM significantly outperforms existing long-context LLMs and efficient long-context processing methods, particularly in tasks requiring intensive reasoning or extremely long-context comprehension.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Robust RAG: Do We Still Need Complex Robust Training in the Era of Powerful LLMs?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11400v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems often suffer from performance degradation when encountering noisy or irrelevant documents, driving researchers to develop sophisticated training strategies to enhance their robustness against such retrieval noise. However, as large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the necessity of these complex training methods is increasingly questioned. In this paper, we systematically investigate whether complex robust training strategies remain necessary as model capacity grows. Through comprehensive experiments spanning multiple model architectures and parameter scales, we evaluate various document selection methods and adversarial training techniques across diverse datasets. Our extensive experiments consistently demonstrate that as models become more powerful, the performance gains brought by complex robust training methods drop off dramatically. We delve into the rationale and find that more powerful models inherently exhibit superior confidence calibration, better generalization across datasets (even when trained with randomly selected documents), and optimal attention mechanisms learned with simpler strategies. Our findings suggest that RAG systems can benefit from simpler architectures and training strategies as models become more powerful, enabling more scalable applications with minimal complexity.</p></details> |  |

It mainly consists of retrieval and generation. The retrieval modules (a.k.a. retrievers) aim to find useful information used to facilitate the generation modules (a.k.a. generators). As such, generators' performance largely depends on the effectiveness and efficiency of retrievers. However, the widely used retrieval paradigm remains flat. It treats retrieval procedures as a one-off deal with constant granularity. Despite effectiveness, we argue that they suffer from two limitations: (1) flat retrieval exerts a significant burden on one retriever; (2) constant granularity limits the ceiling of retrieval performance. In this work, we propose a progressive retrieval paradigm with coarse-to-fine granularity for RAG, termed FunnelRAG, so as to balance effectiveness and efficiency. Specifically, FunnelRAG establishes a progressive retrieval pipeline by collaborating coarse-to-fine granularity, large-to-small quantity, and low-to-high capacity, which can relieve the burden on one retriever and also promote the ceiling of retrieval performance. Extensive experiments manifest that FunnelRAG achieves comparable retrieval performance while the time overhead is reduced by nearly 40 percent.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures, 13 tables.

For structured data, such as knowledge graphs, GraphRAG has been widely used to retrieve relevant information. However, recent studies have revealed that structuring implicit knowledge from text into graphs can benefit certain tasks, extending the application of GraphRAG from graph data to general text-based data. Despite their successful extensions, most applications of GraphRAG for text data have been designed for specific tasks and datasets, lacking a systematic evaluation and comparison between RAG and GraphRAG on widely used text-based benchmarks. In this paper, we systematically evaluate RAG and GraphRAG on well-established benchmark tasks, such as Question Answering and Query-based Summarization. Our results highlight the distinct strengths of RAG and GraphRAG across different tasks and evaluation perspectives. Inspired by these observations, we investigate strategies to integrate their strengths to improve downstream tasks. Additionally, we provide an in-depth discussion of the shortcomings of current GraphRAG approaches and outline directions for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating Language Preference of Multilingual RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11175v1)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) systems enhance language models by integrating external multilingual information to produce context-aware responses. However, mRAG systems struggle with retrieving relevant information due to linguistic variations between queries and documents, generating inconsistent responses when multilingual sources conflict. In this work, we systematically investigate language preferences in both retrieval and generation of mRAG through a series of experiments. Our analysis indicates that retrievers tend to prefer high-resource and query languages, yet this preference does not consistently improve generation performance. Moreover, we observe that generators prefer the query language or Latin scripts, leading to inconsistent outputs. To overcome these issues, we propose Dual Knowledge Multilingual RAG (DKM-RAG), a simple yet effective framework that fuses translated multilingual passages with complementary model knowledge. Empirical results demonstrate that DKM-RAG mitigates language preference in generation and enhances performance across diverse linguistic settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 16 tables, 14 figures</p></details> |

These two capabilities are complementary to each other and essential for LLMs to process large volumes of information that cannot fit into a single prompt. We present a detailed continued training recipe to extend the context window of Llama3-70B-base from 8K to 128K tokens, along with a three-stage instruction tuning process to enhance the model's instruction-following, RAG performance, and long-context understanding capabilities. Our results demonstrate that the Llama3-ChatQA-2-70B model outperforms most existing state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4-Turbo-2024-04-09, Qwen2-72B-Instruct, and Llama3.1-70B-Instruct, on ultra-long tasks beyond 100K tokens, as well as on the RAG benchmark using only a 4K context window, showing the strong long context capability across varying sequence lengths. We further provide extensive comparisons between direct long-context and RAG solutions using the same state-of-the-art long-context LLMs. Interestingly, we find that the performance of strong long-context LLMs using RAG improves when retrieving a larger number of chunks. With a large set of top-k chunks, RAG consistently outperforms direct long-context solution using the same state-of-the-art long-context models (e.g., Llama3-ChatQA-2-70B and Qwen2-72B-Instruct) on both 32K and 128K benchmarks.

| **[Hallucinations and Truth: A Comprehensive Accuracy Evaluation of RAG, LoRA and DoRA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10497v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Generative AI have significantly improved the efficiency and adaptability of natural language processing (NLP) systems, particularly through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA). RAG integrates external knowledge to enhance factual consistency in generative outputs, while LoRA enables parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). DoRA further refines this process by optimizing fine-tuning through adaptive parameter ranking and domain-aware weight adjustments, improving learning efficiency while maintaining inference performance. This paper presents a large-scale empirical evaluation of RAG, LoRA, and DoRA, with model fine-tuning and generation performance assessed on 20,000 FAQ-based queries, while the knowledge base spans 400,000 entries. The study analyzes key performance metrics such as accuracy, relevance, and inference latency. Experimental results demonstrate that DoRA achieves the highest accuracy (90.1%), relevance score (0.88), and lowest latency (110 ms per query), outperforming both LoRA and RAG in real-world, domain-specific generative AI applications. Furthermore, this study examines the trade-offs between fine-tuning efficiency, computational cost, and real-time adaptability across different models. Findings highlight RAG's effectiveness in knowledge grounding, LoRA's cost-efficient domain adaptation, and DoRA's ability to balance fine-tuning efficiency with model precision. These insights provide practical guidance for deploying AI-driven generative systems in accuracy-critical domains such as healthcare, finance, and legal services, ensuring scalability, reliability, and optimal performance in dynamic environments.</p></details> | 10 Pages |
| **[EACO-RAG: Towards Distributed Tiered LLM Deployment using Edge-Assisted and Collaborative RAG with Adaptive Knowledge Update](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20299v2)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in language tasks, but they require high computing power and rely on static knowledge. To overcome these limitations, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) incorporates up-to-date external information into LLMs without extensive fine-tuning. Meanwhile, small language models (SLMs) deployed on edge devices offer efficiency and low latency but often struggle with complex reasoning tasks. Unfortunately, current RAG approaches are predominantly based on centralized databases and have not been adapted to address the distinct constraints associated with deploying SLMs in edge environments. To bridge this gap, we propose Edge-Assisted and Collaborative RAG (EACO-RAG), a lightweight framework that leverages distributed edge nodes for adaptive knowledge updates and retrieval. EACO-RAG also employs a hierarchical collaborative gating mechanism to dynamically select among local, edge-assisted, and cloud-based strategies, with a carefully designed algorithm based on Safe Online Bayesian Optimization to maximize the potential performance enhancements. Experimental results demonstrate that EACO-RAG matches the accuracy of cloud-based knowledge graph RAG systems while reducing total costs by up to 84.6% under relaxed delay constraints and by 65.3% under stricter delay requirements. This work represents our initial effort toward achieving a distributed and scalable tiered LLM deployments, with EACO-RAG serving as a promising first step in unlocking the full potential of hybrid edge-cloud intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[KET-RAG: A Cost-Efficient Multi-Granular Indexing Framework for Graph-RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09304v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-RAG constructs a knowledge graph from text chunks to improve retrieval in Large Language Model (LLM)-based question answering. It is particularly useful in domains such as biomedicine, law, and political science, where retrieval often requires multi-hop reasoning over proprietary documents. Some existing Graph-RAG systems construct KNN graphs based on text chunk relevance, but this coarse-grained approach fails to capture entity relationships within texts, leading to sub-par retrieval and generation quality. To address this, recent solutions leverage LLMs to extract entities and relationships from text chunks, constructing triplet-based knowledge graphs. However, this approach incurs significant indexing costs, especially for large document collections. To ensure a good result accuracy while reducing the indexing cost, we propose KET-RAG, a multi-granular indexing framework. KET-RAG first identifies a small set of key text chunks and leverages an LLM to construct a knowledge graph skeleton. It then builds a text-keyword bipartite graph from all text chunks, serving as a lightweight alternative to a full knowledge graph. During retrieval, KET-RAG searches both structures: it follows the local search strategy of existing Graph-RAG systems on the skeleton while mimicking this search on the bipartite graph to improve retrieval quality. We evaluate eight solutions on two real-world datasets, demonstrating that KET-RAG outperforms all competitors in indexing cost, retrieval effectiveness, and generation quality. Notably, it achieves comparable or superior retrieval quality to Microsoft's Graph-RAG while reducing indexing costs by over an order of magnitude. Additionally, it improves the generation quality by up to 32.4% while lowering indexing costs by around 20%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing RAG with Active Learning on Conversation Records: Reject Incapables and Answer Capables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09073v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a key technique for leveraging external knowledge and reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However, RAG still struggles to fully prevent hallucinated responses. To address this, it is essential to identify samples prone to hallucination or guide LLMs toward correct responses, which experts then annotate to develop high-quality datasets for refining LLMs. However, the growing scarcity of such datasets makes their creation challenging. This paper proposes using the vast amount of conversations from widespread LLM usage to build these datasets, training LLMs to avoid hallucination-prone questions while accurately responding to manageable ones. Given the impracticality of expert-annotating all conversation records, the paper introduces AL4RAG, which uses active learning to select the most suitable conversation samples for annotation, optimizing performance within an annotation budget. Additionally, recognizing that traditional active learning methods are not fully compatible with RAG due to unsuitable distance metrics, we develop a novel sample distance measurement for RAG active learning. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms baselines across multiple metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diversity Enhances an LLM's Performance in RAG and Long-context Task](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09017v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the challenge of context window limitations, primarily due to the quadratic time complexity of the self-attention mechanism (\(O(N^2)\), where \(N\) denotes the context window length). This constraint impacts tasks such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in question answering (Q\&A) and long context summarization. A common approach involves selecting content with the highest similarity to the query; however, this often leads to redundancy and the exclusion of diverse yet relevant information. Building on principles from Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) and Farthest Point Sampling (FPS), we integrate diversity into the content selection process. Our findings reveal that incorporating diversity substantially increases the recall of selecting relevant sentences or chunks before LLM-based Q\&A and summarization. These results highlight the importance of maintaining diversity in future LLM applications to further improve summarization and Q\&A outcomes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Better RAG using Relevant Information Gain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12101v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A common way to extend the memory of large language models (LLMs) is by retrieval augmented generation (RAG), which inserts text retrieved from a larger memory into an LLM's context window. However, the context window is typically limited to several thousand tokens, which limits the number of retrieved passages that can inform a model's response. For this reason, it's important to avoid occupying context window space with redundant information by ensuring a degree of diversity among retrieved passages. At the same time, the information should also be relevant to the current task. Most prior methods that encourage diversity among retrieved results, such as Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR), do so by incorporating an objective that explicitly trades off diversity and relevance. We propose a novel simple optimization metric based on relevant information gain, a probabilistic measure of the total information relevant to a query for a set of retrieved results. By optimizing this metric, diversity organically emerges from our system. When used as a drop-in replacement for the retrieval component of a RAG system, this method yields state-of-the-art performance on question answering tasks from the Retrieval Augmented Generation Benchmark (RGB), outperforming existing metrics that directly optimize for relevance and diversity.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 page paper submitted to EMNLP</p></details> |

However, current implementations face two critical challenges: maintaining factual accuracy and delivering coherent, context-aware instruction. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) partially addresses these issues, its reliance on pure semantic similarity limits its effectiveness in educational contexts where conceptual relationships are crucial. This paper introduces Knowledge Graph-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG), a novel framework that integrates structured knowledge representation with context-aware retrieval to enable more effective AI tutoring. We present three key contributions: (1) a novel architecture that grounds AI responses in structured domain knowledge, (2) empirical validation through controlled experiments (n=76) demonstrating significant learning improvements (35% increase in assessment scores, p<0.001), and (3) a comprehensive implementation framework addressing practical deployment considerations.

| **[A RAG Approach for Generating Competency Questions in Ontology Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08820v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Competency question (CQ) formulation is central to several ontology development and evaluation methodologies. Traditionally, the task of crafting these competency questions heavily relies on the effort of domain experts and knowledge engineers which is often time-consuming and labor-intensive. With the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), there arises the possibility to automate and enhance this process. Unlike other similar works which use existing ontologies or knowledge graphs as input to LLMs, we present a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach that uses LLMs for the automatic generation of CQs given a set of scientific papers considered to be a domain knowledge base. We investigate its performance and specifically, we study the impact of different number of papers to the RAG and different temperature setting of the LLM. We conduct experiments using GPT-4 on two domain ontology engineering tasks and compare results against ground-truth CQs constructed by domain experts. Empirical assessments on the results, utilizing evaluation metrics (precision and consistency), reveal that compared to zero-shot prompting, adding relevant domain knowledge to the RAG improves the performance of LLMs on generating CQs for concrete ontology engineering tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph RAG-Tool Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07223v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for selecting relevant tools from a tool knowledge base enable LLM agents to scale their complex tool calling capabilities to hundreds or thousands of external tools, APIs, or agents-as-tools. However, traditional RAG-based tool retrieval fails to capture structured dependencies between tools, limiting the retrieval accuracy of a retrieved tool's dependencies. For example, among a vector database of tools, a "get stock price" API requires a "stock ticker" parameter from a "get stock ticker" API, and both depend on OS-level internet connectivity tools. In this paper, we address this limitation by introducing Graph RAG-Tool Fusion, a novel plug-and-play approach that combines the strengths of vector-based retrieval with efficient graph traversal to capture all relevant tools (nodes) along with any nested dependencies (edges) within the predefined tool knowledge graph. We also present ToolLinkOS, a new tool selection benchmark of 573 fictional tools, spanning over 15 industries, each with an average of 6.3 tool dependencies. We demonstrate that Graph RAG-Tool Fusion achieves absolute improvements of 71.7% and 22.1% over na\"ive RAG on ToolLinkOS and ToolSandbox benchmarks, respectively (mAP@10).

While language models show promise in this context, their probabilistic nature complicates truthfulness and comprehensibility. This paper examines state-of-the-art Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhanced with alignment techniques to fulfill GDPR obligations. We evaluate RAG systems incorporating an alignment module like Rewindable Auto-regressive Inference (RAIN) and our proposed multidimensional extension, MultiRAIN, using a Privacy Q&A dataset. Responses are optimized for preciseness and comprehensibility and are assessed through 21 metrics, including deterministic and large language model-based evaluations. Our results show that RAG systems with an alignment module outperform baseline RAG systems on most metrics, though none fully match human answers. Principal component analysis of the results reveals complex interactions between metrics, highlighting the need to refine metrics. This study provides a foundation for integrating advanced natural language processing systems into legal compliance frameworks.</p></details> | Submitted to ARR |

Currently, the most popular methods in literature consists of fine-tuning the model on written mathematical content such as academic publications and textbooks, so that the model can learn to emulate the style of mathematical writing. In this project, we explore the effectiveness of using retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to address gaps in the mathematical reasoning of LLMs. We develop LemmaHead, a RAG knowledge base that supplements queries to the model with relevant mathematical context, with particular focus on context from published textbooks. To measure our model's performance in mathematical reasoning, our testing paradigm focuses on the task of automated theorem proving via generating proofs to a given mathematical claim in the Lean formal language.</p></details> |  |

Through systematic empirical evaluation of three different LLM variants across multiple parameter configurations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our testing methodology in assessing both functional correctness and extra-functional properties. Our framework implements 17 distinct metrics that encompass syntactic analysis, semantic evaluation, and behavioral evaluation through LLM judges. The study reveals significant information about how different architectural choices and parameter configurations affect system performance, particularly highlighting the impact of temperature and top-p parameters on response quality. The tests were carried out on a tourism recommendation system for the V\"armland region, utilizing standard and RAG-enhanced configurations. The results indicate that the newer LLM versions show modest improvements in performance metrics, though the differences are more pronounced in response length and complexity rather than in semantic quality. The research contributes practical insights for implementing robust testing practices in LLM-RAG systems, providing valuable guidance to organizations deploying these architectures in production environments.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Typically, such RAG systems retrieve search results, download HTML sources of the results, and then extract plain texts from the HTML sources. Plain text documents or chunks are fed into the LLMs to augment the generation. However, much of the structural and semantic information inherent in HTML, such as headings and table structures, is lost during this plain-text-based RAG process. To alleviate this problem, we propose HtmlRAG, which uses HTML instead of plain text as the format of retrieved knowledge in RAG. We believe HTML is better than plain text in modeling knowledge in external documents, and most LLMs possess robust capacities to understand HTML. However, utilizing HTML presents new challenges. HTML contains additional content such as tags, JavaScript, and CSS specifications, which bring extra input tokens and noise to the RAG system. To address this issue, we propose HTML cleaning, compression, and a two-step block-tree-based pruning strategy, to shorten the HTML while minimizing the loss of information. Experiments on six QA datasets confirm the superiority of using HTML in RAG systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WWW 2025 main conference.

To this aim, this paper introduces a solution driven by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which leverages the capabilities of generative Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the retrieval of health-related documents grounded in scientific evidence. In particular, we propose a three-stage model: in the first stage, the user's query is employed to retrieve topically relevant passages with associated references from a knowledge base constituted by scientific literature. In the second stage, these passages, alongside the initial query, are processed by LLMs to generate a contextually relevant rich text (GenText). In the last stage, the documents to be retrieved are evaluated and ranked both from the point of view of topical relevance and factual accuracy by means of their comparison with GenText, either through stance detection or semantic similarity. In addition to calculating factual accuracy, GenText can offer a layer of explainability for it, aiding users in understanding the reasoning behind the retrieval. Experimental evaluation of our model on benchmark datasets and against baseline models demonstrates its effectiveness in enhancing the retrieval of both topically relevant and factually accurate health information, thus presenting a significant step forward in the health misinformation mitigation problem.</p></details> |  |

This poster paper introduces early-stage work on a Multi-Agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System designed to enhance learning efficiency by integrating these heterogeneous resources. Using specialized agents tailored for specific resource types (e.g., YouTube tutorials, GitHub repositories, documentation websites, and search engines), the system automates the retrieval and synthesis of relevant information.

While existing approaches such as ReAct maintain reasoning chains within the language model's context window, we observe that this often leads to plan fragmentation and execution failures. Our key insight is that by isolating the reasoning plan as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) outside the LM's working memory, we can enable (1) systematic exploration of reasoning paths, (2) atomic subqueries enabling precise retrievals and grounding, and (3) efficiency through parallel execution and bounded context window utilization. Moreover, Plan*RAG's modular design allows it to be integrated with existing RAG methods, thus providing a practical solution to improve current RAG systems. On standard multi-hop reasoning benchmarks, Plan*RAG consistently achieves improvements over recently proposed methods such as RQ-RAG and Self-RAG, while maintaining comparable computational costs.</p></details> | 19 pages, preprint |

However, their reliance on static training data limits their ability to respond to dynamic, real time queries, resulting in outdated or inaccurate outputs. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a solution, enhancing LLMs by integrating real time data retrieval to provide contextually relevant and up-to-date responses. Despite its promise, traditional RAG systems are constrained by static workflows and lack the adaptability required for multistep reasoning and complex task management. Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG) transcends these limitations by embedding autonomous AI agents into the RAG pipeline. These agents leverage agentic design patterns reflection, planning, tool use, and multiagent collaboration to dynamically manage retrieval strategies, iteratively refine contextual understanding, and adapt workflows to meet complex task requirements. This integration enables Agentic RAG systems to deliver unparalleled flexibility, scalability, and context awareness across diverse applications. This survey provides a comprehensive exploration of Agentic RAG, beginning with its foundational principles and the evolution of RAG paradigms. It presents a detailed taxonomy of Agentic RAG architectures, highlights key applications in industries such as healthcare, finance, and education, and examines practical implementation strategies. Additionally, it addresses challenges in scaling these systems, ensuring ethical decision making, and optimizing performance for real-world applications, while providing detailed insights into frameworks and tools for implementing Agentic RAG.</p></details> |  |

Mitigation is achieved in a question-answering Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework while detection is obtained by introducing the Negative Missing Information Scoring System (NMISS), which accounts for contextual relevance in responses. While RAG mitigates hallucinations by grounding answers in external data, NMISS refines the evaluation by identifying cases where traditional metrics incorrectly flag contextually accurate responses as hallucinations. I use Italian health news articles as context to evaluate LLM performance. Results show that Gemma2 and GPT-4 outperform the other models, with GPT-4 producing answers closely aligned with reference responses. Mid-tier models, such as Llama2, Llama3, and Mistral benefit significantly from NMISS, highlighting their ability to provide richer contextual information. This combined approach offers new insights into the reduction and more accurate assessment of hallucinations in LLMs, with applications in real-world healthcare tasks and other domains.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches predominantly rely on prompt engineering, utilizing meticulously designed expert response chains or structured guidance. However, prompt-based techniques have failed to perform well in the sensor array signal processing (SASP) area due the lack of specific domain knowledge. To address this issue, we propose an automated modeling approach based on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique, which consists of two principal components: a multi-agent (MA) structure and a graph-based RAG (Graph-RAG) process. The MA structure is tailored for the architectural AOM process, with each agent being designed based on principles of human modeling procedure. The Graph-RAG process serves to match user query with specific SASP modeling knowledge, thereby enhancing the modeling result. Results on ten classical signal processing problems demonstrate that the proposed approach (termed as MAG-RAG) outperforms several AOM benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Concepts such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and other advanced techniques have been developed to enhance these systems by integrating specific university data, enabling LLMs to provide informed responses on admissions and academic counseling. However, these enhanced RAG techniques often involve high operational costs and require the training of complex, specialized modules, which poses challenges for practical deployment. Additionally, in the educational context, it is crucial to provide accurate answers to prevent misinformation, a task that LLM-based systems find challenging without appropriate strategies and methods. In this paper, we introduce the Unified RAG (URAG) Framework, a hybrid approach that significantly improves the accuracy of responses, particularly for critical queries. Experimental results demonstrate that URAG enhances our in-house, lightweight model to perform comparably to state-of-the-art commercial models. Moreover, to validate its practical applicability, we conducted a case study at our educational institution, which received positive feedback and acclaim.

However, current benchmarks for evaluating RAG systems suffer from two key deficiencies: (1) they fail to adequately measure LLMs' capability in handling long-context retrieval due to a lack of datasets that reflect the characteristics of retrieved documents, and (2) they lack a comprehensive evaluation method for assessing LLMs' ability to generate long-form responses that effectively exploits retrieved information. To address these shortcomings, we introduce the Long$^2$RAG benchmark and the Key Point Recall (KPR) metric. Long$^2$RAG comprises 280 questions spanning 10 domains and across 8 question categories, each associated with 5 retrieved documents with an average length of 2,444 words.

While it empowers individuals it also enables malicious actors to perpetrate scams such as fraudulent phone calls and user impersonations. This growing threat necessitates a robust system to protect individuals In this paper we introduce a novel real time fraud detection mechanism using Retrieval Augmented Generation technology to address this challenge on two fronts. First our system incorporates a continuously updating policy checking feature that transcribes phone calls in real time and uses RAG based models to verify that the caller is not soliciting private information thus ensuring transparency and the authenticity of the conversation. Second we implement a real time user impersonation check with a two step verification process to confirm the callers identity ensuring accountability. A key innovation of our system is the ability to update policies without retraining the entire model enhancing its adaptability. We validated our RAG based approach using synthetic call recordings achieving an accuracy of 97.98 percent and an F1score of 97.44 percent with 100 calls outperforming state of the art methods. This robust and flexible fraud detection system is well suited for real world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[A RAG-Based Institutional Assistant](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13880v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong text generation capabilities, they struggle in scenarios requiring access to structured knowledge bases or specific documents, limiting their effectiveness in knowledge-intensive tasks. To address this limitation, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models have been developed, enabling generative models to incorporate relevant document fragments into their inputs. In this paper, we design and evaluate a RAG-based virtual assistant specifically tailored for the University of S\~ao Paulo. Our system architecture comprises two key modules: a retriever and a generative model. We experiment with different types of models for both components, adjusting hyperparameters such as chunk size and the number of retrieved documents. Our optimal retriever model achieves a Top-5 accuracy of 30%, while our most effective generative model scores 22.04\% against ground truth answers. Notably, when the correct document chunks are supplied to the LLMs, accuracy significantly improves to 54.02%, an increase of over 30 percentage points. Conversely, without contextual input, performance declines to 13.68%. These findings highlight the critical role of database access in enhancing LLM performance. They also reveal the limitations of current semantic search methods in accurately identifying relevant documents and underscore the ongoing challenges LLMs face in generating precise responses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parallel Key-Value Cache Fusion for Position Invariant RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07523v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) underscore the necessity of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to leverage external information. However, LLMs are sensitive to the position of relevant information within contexts and tend to generate incorrect responses when such information is placed in the middle, known as `Lost in the Middle' phenomenon. In this paper, we introduce a framework that generates consistent outputs for decoder-only models, irrespective of the input context order. Experimental results for three open domain question answering tasks demonstrate position invariance, where the model is not sensitive to input context order, and superior robustness to irrelevent passages compared to prevailing approaches for RAG pipelines.</p></details> | 5 pages |
| **[Towards Interpretable Radiology Report Generation via Concept Bottlenecks using a Multi-Agentic RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16086v2)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has advanced medical image classification, but interpretability challenges hinder its clinical adoption. This study enhances interpretability in Chest X-ray (CXR) classification by using concept bottleneck models (CBMs) and a multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for report generation. By modeling relationships between visual features and clinical concepts, we create interpretable concept vectors that guide a multi-agent RAG system to generate radiology reports, enhancing clinical relevance, explainability, and transparency. Evaluation of the generated reports using an LLM-as-a-judge confirmed the interpretability and clinical utility of our model's outputs. On the COVID-QU dataset, our model achieved 81% classification accuracy and demonstrated robust report generation performance, with five key metrics ranging between 84% and 90%. This interpretable multi-agent framework bridges the gap between high-performance AI and the explainability required for reliable AI-driven CXR analysis in clinical settings.

| **[RAG with Differential Privacy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19291v2)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the dominant technique to provide \emph{Large Language Models} (LLM) with fresh and relevant context, mitigating the risk of hallucinations and improving the overall quality of responses in environments with large and fast moving knowledge bases. However, the integration of external documents into the generation process raises significant privacy concerns. Indeed, when added to a prompt, it is not possible to guarantee a response will not inadvertently expose confidential data, leading to potential breaches of privacy and ethical dilemmas. This paper explores a practical solution to this problem suitable to general knowledge extraction from personal data. It shows \emph{differentially private token generation} is a viable approach to private RAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating Diverse Q&A Benchmarks for RAG Evaluation with DataMorgana](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12789v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, especially in domain-specific contexts, requires benchmarks that address the distinctive requirements of the applicative scenario. Since real data can be hard to obtain, a common strategy is to use LLM-based methods to generate synthetic data. Existing solutions are general purpose: given a document, they generate a question to build a Q&A pair. However, although the generated questions can be individually good, they are typically not diverse enough to reasonably cover the different ways real end-users can interact with the RAG system. We introduce here DataMorgana, a tool for generating highly customizable and diverse synthetic Q&A benchmarks tailored to RAG applications. DataMorgana enables detailed configurations of user and question categories and provides control over their distribution within the benchmark. It uses a lightweight two-stage process, ensuring efficiency and fast iterations, while generating benchmarks that reflect the expected traffic. We conduct a thorough line of experiments, showing quantitatively and qualitatively that DataMorgana surpasses existing tools and approaches in producing lexically, syntactically, and semantically diverse question sets across domain-specific and general-knowledge corpora. DataMorgana will be made available to selected teams in the research community, as first beta testers, in the context of the upcoming SIGIR'2025 LiveRAG challenge to be announced in early February 2025.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual RAG: Expanding MLLM visual knowledge without fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10834v1)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved notable performance in computer vision tasks that require reasoning across visual and textual modalities, yet their capabilities are limited to their pre-trained data, requiring extensive fine-tuning for updates. Recent researches have explored the use of In-Context Learning (ICL) to overcome these challenges by providing a set of demonstrating examples as context to augment MLLMs performance in several tasks, showing that many-shot ICL leads to substantial improvements compared to few-shot ICL. However, the reliance on numerous demonstrating examples and the limited MLLMs context windows presents significant obstacles. This paper aims to address these challenges by introducing a novel approach, Visual RAG, that synergically combines the MLLMs capability to learn from the context, with a retrieval mechanism. The crux of this approach is to ensure to augment the MLLM knowledge by selecting only the most relevant demonstrating examples for the query, pushing it to learn by analogy. In this way, relying on the new information provided dynamically during inference time, the resulting system is not limited to the knowledge extracted from the training data, but can be updated rapidly and easily without fine-tuning. Furthermore, this greatly reduces the computational costs for improving the model image classification performance, and augments the model knowledge to new visual domains and tasks it was not trained for. Extensive experiments on eight different datasets in the state of the art spanning several domains and image classification tasks show that the proposed Visual RAG, compared to the most recent state of the art (i.e., many-shot ICL), is able to obtain an accuracy that is very close or even higher (approx. +2% improvement on average) while using a much smaller set of demonstrating examples (approx. only 23% on average).</p></details> |  |
| **[4bit-Quantization in Vector-Embedding for RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10534v1)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a promising technique that has shown great potential in addressing some of the limitations of large language models (LLMs). LLMs have two major limitations: they can contain outdated information due to their training data, and they can generate factually inaccurate responses, a phenomenon known as hallucinations. RAG aims to mitigate these issues by leveraging a database of relevant documents, which are stored as embedding vectors in a high-dimensional space. However, one of the challenges of using high-dimensional embeddings is that they require a significant amount of memory to store. This can be a major issue, especially when dealing with large databases of documents. To alleviate this problem, we propose the use of 4-bit quantization to store the embedding vectors. This involves reducing the precision of the vectors from 32-bit floating-point numbers to 4-bit integers, which can significantly reduce the memory requirements. Our approach has several benefits. Firstly, it significantly reduces the memory storage requirements of the high-dimensional vector database, making it more feasible to deploy RAG systems in resource-constrained environments. Secondly, it speeds up the searching process, as the reduced precision of the vectors allows for faster computation. Our code is available at https://github.com/taeheej/4bit-Quantization-in-Vector-Embedding-for-RAG</p></details> |  |
| **[SteLLA: A Structured Grading System Using LLMs with RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09092v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong general capabilities in many applications. However, how to make them reliable tools for some specific tasks such as automated short answer grading (ASAG) remains a challenge. We present SteLLA (Structured Grading System Using LLMs with RAG) in which a) Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach is used to empower LLMs specifically on the ASAG task by extracting structured information from the highly relevant and reliable external knowledge based on the instructor-provided reference answer and rubric, b) an LLM performs a structured and question-answering-based evaluation of student answers to provide analytical grades and feedback. A real-world dataset that contains students' answers in an exam was collected from a college-level Biology course. Experiments show that our proposed system can achieve substantial agreement with the human grader while providing break-down grades and feedback on all the knowledge points examined in the problem. A qualitative and error analysis of the feedback generated by GPT4 shows that GPT4 is good at capturing facts while may be prone to inferring too much implication from the given text in the grading task which provides insights into the usage of LLMs in the ASAG system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Addressing the sustainable AI trilemma: a case study on LLM agents and RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08262v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities, but their widespread deployment and more advanced applications raise critical sustainability challenges, particularly in inference energy consumption. We propose the concept of the Sustainable AI Trilemma, highlighting the tensions between AI capability, digital equity, and environmental sustainability. Through a systematic case study of LLM agents and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), we analyze the energy costs embedded in memory module designs and introduce novel metrics to quantify the trade-offs between energy consumption and system performance. Our experimental results reveal significant energy inefficiencies in current memory-augmented frameworks and demonstrate that resource-constrained environments face disproportionate efficiency penalties. Our findings challenge the prevailing LLM-centric paradigm in agent design and provide practical insights for developing more sustainable AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[ASTRID -- An Automated and Scalable TRIaD for the Evaluation of RAG-based Clinical Question Answering Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08208v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive potential in clinical question answering (QA), with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) emerging as a leading approach for ensuring the factual accuracy of model responses. However, current automated RAG metrics perform poorly in clinical and conversational use cases. Using clinical human evaluations of responses is expensive, unscalable, and not conducive to the continuous iterative development of RAG systems. To address these challenges, we introduce ASTRID - an Automated and Scalable TRIaD for evaluating clinical QA systems leveraging RAG - consisting of three metrics: Context Relevance (CR), Refusal Accuracy (RA), and Conversational Faithfulness (CF). Our novel evaluation metric, CF, is designed to better capture the faithfulness of a model's response to the knowledge base without penalising conversational elements. To validate our triad, we curate a dataset of over 200 real-world patient questions posed to an LLM-based QA agent during surgical follow-up for cataract surgery - the highest volume operation in the world - augmented with clinician-selected questions for emergency, clinical, and non-clinical out-of-domain scenarios. We demonstrate that CF can predict human ratings of faithfulness better than existing definitions for conversational use cases. Furthermore, we show that evaluation using our triad consisting of CF, RA, and CR exhibits alignment with clinician assessment for inappropriate, harmful, or unhelpful responses. Finally, using nine different LLMs, we demonstrate that the three metrics can closely agree with human evaluations, highlighting the potential of these metrics for use in LLM-driven automated evaluation pipelines. We also publish the prompts and datasets for these experiments, providing valuable resources for further research and development.</p></details> | 29 pages |
| **[Research on the Online Update Method for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Model with Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07063v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the contemporary context of rapid advancements in information technology and the exponential growth of data volume, language models are confronted with significant challenges in effectively navigating the dynamic and ever-evolving information landscape to update and adapt to novel knowledge in real time. In this work, an online update method is proposed, which is based on the existing Retrieval Enhanced Generation (RAG) model with multiple innovation mechanisms. Firstly, the dynamic memory is used to capture the emerging data samples, and then gradually integrate them into the core model through a tunable knowledge distillation strategy. At the same time, hierarchical indexing and multi-layer gating mechanism are introduced into the retrieval module to ensure that the retrieved content is more targeted and accurate. Finally, a multi-stage network structure is established for different types of inputs in the generation stage, and cross-attention matching and screening are carried out on the intermediate representations of each stage to ensure the effective integration and iterative update of new and old knowledge. Experimental results show that the proposed method is better than the existing mainstream comparison models in terms of knowledge retention and inference accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrustRAG: Enhancing Robustness and Trustworthiness in RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00879v2)** | 2025-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge sources, enabling more accurate and contextually relevant responses tailored to user queries. However, these systems remain vulnerable to corpus poisoning attacks that can significantly degrade LLM performance through the injection of malicious content. To address these challenges, we propose TrustRAG, a robust framework that systematically filters compromised and irrelevant contents before they are retrieved for generation. Our approach implements a two-stage defense mechanism: At the first stage, it employs K-means clustering to identify potential attack patterns in retrieved documents using cosine similarity and ROUGE metrics as guidance, effectively isolating suspicious content. Secondly, it performs a self-assessment which detects malicious documents and resolves discrepancies between the model's internal knowledge and external information. TrustRAG functions as a plug-and-play, training-free module that integrates seamlessly with any language model, whether open or closed-source. In addition, TrustRAG maintains high contextual relevance while strengthening defenses against corpus poisoning attacks. Through extensive experimental validation, we demonstrate that TrustRAG delivers substantial improvements in retrieval accuracy, efficiency, and attack resistance compared to existing approaches across multiple model architectures and datasets. We have made TrustRAG available as open-source software at \url{https://github.com/HuichiZhou/TrustRAG}.</p></details> |  |
