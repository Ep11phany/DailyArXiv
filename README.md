| **[IberBench: LLM Evaluation on Iberian Languages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16921v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) remain difficult to evaluate comprehensively, particularly for languages other than English, where high-quality data is often limited. Existing benchmarks and leaderboards are predominantly English-centric, with only a few addressing other languages. These benchmarks fall short in several key areas: they overlook the diversity of language varieties, prioritize fundamental Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities over tasks of industrial relevance, and are static. With these aspects in mind, we present IberBench, a comprehensive and extensible benchmark designed to assess LLM performance on both fundamental and industry-relevant NLP tasks, in languages spoken across the Iberian Peninsula and Ibero-America. IberBench integrates 101 datasets from evaluation campaigns and recent benchmarks, covering 22 task categories such as sentiment and emotion analysis, toxicity detection, and summarization. The benchmark addresses key limitations in current evaluation practices, such as the lack of linguistic diversity and static evaluation setups by enabling continual updates and community-driven model and dataset submissions moderated by a committee of experts. We evaluate 23 LLMs ranging from 100 million to 14 billion parameters and provide empirical insights into their strengths and limitations. Our findings indicate that (i) LLMs perform worse on industry-relevant tasks than in fundamental ones, (ii) performance is on average lower for Galician and Basque, (iii) some tasks show results close to random, and (iv) in other tasks LLMs perform above random but below shared task systems. IberBench offers open-source implementations for the entire evaluation pipeline, including dataset normalization and hosting, incremental evaluation of LLMs, and a publicly accessible leaderboard.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stop Overthinking: A Survey on Efficient Reasoning for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16419v3)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex tasks. Recent advancements in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have further improved performance in System-2 reasoning domains like mathematics and programming by harnessing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to enhance the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, while longer CoT reasoning sequences improve performance, they also introduce significant computational overhead due to verbose and redundant outputs, known as the "overthinking phenomenon". In this paper, we provide the first structured survey to systematically investigate and explore the current progress toward achieving efficient reasoning in LLMs. Overall, relying on the inherent mechanism of LLMs, we categorize existing works into several key directions: (1) model-based efficient reasoning, which considers optimizing full-length reasoning models into more concise reasoning models or directly training efficient reasoning models; (2) reasoning output-based efficient reasoning, which aims to dynamically reduce reasoning steps and length during inference; (3) input prompts-based efficient reasoning, which seeks to enhance reasoning efficiency based on input prompt properties such as difficulty or length control. Additionally, we introduce the use of efficient data for training reasoning models, explore the reasoning capabilities of small language models, and discuss evaluation methods and benchmarking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Website: https://github.com/Eclipsess/Awesome-Efficient-Reasoning-LLMs</p></details> |
| **[Do Large Language Models know who did what to whom?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16884v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly criticized for not understanding language. However, many critiques focus on cognitive abilities that, in humans, are distinct from language processing. Here, we instead study a kind of understanding tightly linked to language: inferring who did what to whom (thematic roles) in a sentence. Does the central training objective of LLMs-word prediction-result in sentence representations that capture thematic roles? In two experiments, we characterized sentence representations in four LLMs. In contrast to human similarity judgments, in LLMs the overall representational similarity of sentence pairs reflected syntactic similarity but not whether their agent and patient assignments were identical vs. reversed. Furthermore, we found little evidence that thematic role information was available in any subset of hidden units. However, some attention heads robustly captured thematic roles, independently of syntax. Therefore, LLMs can extract thematic roles but, relative to humans, this information influences their representations more weakly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Critical Thinking with AI: A Tailored Warning System for RAG Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16883v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems offer a powerful approach to enhancing large language model (LLM) outputs by incorporating fact-checked, contextually relevant information. However, fairness and reliability concerns persist, as hallucinations can emerge at both the retrieval and generation stages, affecting users' reasoning and decision-making. Our research explores how tailored warning messages -- whose content depends on the specific context of hallucination -- shape user reasoning and actions in an educational quiz setting. Preliminary findings suggest that while warnings improve accuracy and awareness of high-level hallucinations, they may also introduce cognitive friction, leading to confusion and diminished trust in the system. By examining these interactions, this work contributes to the broader goal of AI-augmented reasoning: developing systems that actively support human reflection, critical thinking, and informed decision-making rather than passive information consumption.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 2025 ACM Workshop on Human-AI Interaction for Augmented Reasoning</p></details> |
| **[Context-Enhanced Vulnerability Detection Based on Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16877v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vulnerability detection is a critical aspect of software security. Accurate detection is essential to prevent potential security breaches and protect software systems from malicious attacks. Recently, vulnerability detection methods leveraging deep learning and large language models (LLMs) have garnered increasing attention. However, existing approaches often focus on analyzing individual files or functions, which limits their ability to gather sufficient contextual information. Analyzing entire repositories to gather context introduces significant noise and computational overhead. To address these challenges, we propose a context-enhanced vulnerability detection approach that combines program analysis with LLMs. Specifically, we use program analysis to extract contextual information at various levels of abstraction, thereby filtering out irrelevant noise. The abstracted context along with source code are provided to LLM for vulnerability detection. We investigate how different levels of contextual granularity improve LLM-based vulnerability detection performance. Our goal is to strike a balance between providing sufficient detail to accurately capture vulnerabilities and minimizing unnecessary complexity that could hinder model performance. Based on an extensive study using GPT-4, DeepSeek, and CodeLLaMA with various prompting strategies, our key findings includes: (1) incorporating abstracted context significantly enhances vulnerability detection effectiveness; (2) different models benefit from distinct levels of abstraction depending on their code understanding capabilities; and (3) capturing program behavior through program analysis for general LLM-based code analysis tasks can be a direction that requires further attention.</p></details> |  |
| **[aiXamine: Simplified LLM Safety and Security](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14985v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) for safety and security remains a complex task, often requiring users to navigate a fragmented landscape of ad hoc benchmarks, datasets, metrics, and reporting formats. To address this challenge, we present aiXamine, a comprehensive black-box evaluation platform for LLM safety and security. aiXamine integrates over 40 tests (i.e., benchmarks) organized into eight key services targeting specific dimensions of safety and security: adversarial robustness, code security, fairness and bias, hallucination, model and data privacy, out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness, over-refusal, and safety alignment. The platform aggregates the evaluation results into a single detailed report per model, providing a detailed breakdown of model performance, test examples, and rich visualizations. We used aiXamine to assess over 50 publicly available and proprietary LLMs, conducting over 2K examinations. Our findings reveal notable vulnerabilities in leading models, including susceptibility to adversarial attacks in OpenAI's GPT-4o, biased outputs in xAI's Grok-3, and privacy weaknesses in Google's Gemini 2.0. Additionally, we observe that open-source models can match or exceed proprietary models in specific services such as safety alignment, fairness and bias, and OOD robustness. Finally, we identify trade-offs between distillation strategies, model size, training methods, and architectural choices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Natural Language Processing in the Patent Domain: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04105v3)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Patents, which encapsulate crucial technical and legal information in text form and referenced drawings, present a rich domain for natural language processing (NLP) applications. As NLP technologies evolve, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding capabilities in general text processing and generation tasks. However, the application of LLMs in the patent domain remains under-explored and under-developed due to the complexity of patents, particularly their language and legal framework. Understanding the unique characteristics of patent documents and related research in the patent domain becomes essential for researchers to apply these tools effectively. Therefore, this paper aims to equip NLP researchers with the essential knowledge to navigate this complex domain efficiently. We introduce the relevant fundamental aspects of patents to provide solid background information. In addition, we systematically break down the structural and linguistic characteristics unique to patents and map out how NLP can be leveraged for patent analysis and generation. Moreover, we demonstrate the spectrum of text-based and multimodal patent-related tasks, including nine patent analysis and four patent generation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Artificial Intelligence Review</p></details> |
| **[Exploring How LLMs Capture and Represent Domain-Specific Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16871v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study whether Large Language Models (LLMs) inherently capture domain-specific nuances in natural language. Our experiments probe the domain sensitivity of LLMs by examining their ability to distinguish queries from different domains using hidden states generated during the prefill phase. We reveal latent domain-related trajectories that indicate the model's internal recognition of query domains. We also study the robustness of these domain representations to variations in prompt styles and sources. Our approach leverages these representations for model selection, mapping the LLM that best matches the domain trace of the input query (i.e., the model with the highest performance on similar traces). Our findings show that LLMs can differentiate queries for related domains, and that the fine-tuned model is not always the most accurate. Unlike previous work, our interpretations apply to both closed and open-ended generative tasks</p></details> |  |
| **[TALES: Text Adventure Learning Environment Suite](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14128v4)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning is an essential skill to enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with the world. As tasks become more complex, they demand increasingly sophisticated and diverse reasoning capabilities for sequential decision-making, requiring structured reasoning over the context history to determine the next best action. We introduce TALES, a diverse collection of synthetic and human-written text-adventure games designed to challenge and evaluate diverse reasoning capabilities. We present results over a range of LLMs, open- and closed-weights, performing a qualitative analysis on the top performing models. Despite an impressive showing on synthetic games, even the top LLM-driven agents fail to achieve 15% on games designed for human enjoyment. Code and visualization of the experiments can be found at https://microsoft.github.io/tale-suite.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emo Pillars: Knowledge Distillation to Support Fine-Grained Context-Aware and Context-Less Emotion Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16856v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most datasets for sentiment analysis lack context in which an opinion was expressed, often crucial for emotion understanding, and are mainly limited by a few emotion categories. Foundation large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 suffer from over-predicting emotions and are too resource-intensive. We design an LLM-based data synthesis pipeline and leverage a large model, Mistral-7b, for the generation of training examples for more accessible, lightweight BERT-type encoder models. We focus on enlarging the semantic diversity of examples and propose grounding the generation into a corpus of narratives to produce non-repetitive story-character-centered utterances with unique contexts over 28 emotion classes. By running 700K inferences in 450 GPU hours, we contribute with the dataset of 100K contextual and also 300K context-less examples to cover both scenarios. We use it for fine-tuning pre-trained encoders, which results in several Emo Pillars models. We show that Emo Pillars models are highly adaptive to new domains when tuned to specific tasks such as GoEmotions, ISEAR, IEMOCAP, and EmoContext, reaching the SOTA performance on the first three. We also validate our dataset, conducting statistical analysis and human evaluation, and confirm the success of our measures in utterance diversification (although less for the neutral class) and context personalization, while pointing out the need for improved handling of out-of-taxonomy labels within the pipeline.</p></details> |  |
| **[Monte Carlo Planning with Large Language Model for Text-Based Game Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16855v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-based games provide valuable environments for language-based autonomous agents. However, planning-then-learning paradigms, such as those combining Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and reinforcement learning (RL), are notably time-consuming due to extensive iterations. Additionally, these algorithms perform uncertainty-driven exploration but lack language understanding and reasoning abilities. In this paper, we introduce the Monte Carlo planning with Dynamic Memory-guided Large language model (MC-DML) algorithm. MC-DML leverages the language understanding and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) alongside the exploratory advantages of tree search algorithms. Specifically, we enhance LLMs with in-trial and cross-trial memory mechanisms, enabling them to learn from past experiences and dynamically adjust action evaluations during planning. We conduct experiments on a series of text-based games from the Jericho benchmark. Our results demonstrate that the MC-DML algorithm significantly enhances performance across various games at the initial planning phase, outperforming strong contemporary methods that require multiple iterations. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our algorithm, paving the way for more efficient language-grounded planning in complex environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comparative Performance Evaluation of Large Language Models for Extracting Molecular Interactions and Pathway Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08813v4)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Identification of the interactions and regulatory relations between biomolecules play pivotal roles in understanding complex biological systems and the mechanisms underlying diverse biological functions. However, the collection of such molecular interactions has heavily relied on expert curation in the past, making it labor-intensive and time-consuming. To mitigate these challenges, we propose leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to automate genome-scale extraction of this crucial knowledge. Results: In this study, we investigate the efficacy of various LLMs in addressing biological tasks, such as the recognition of protein interactions, identification of genes linked to pathways affected by low-dose radiation, and the delineation of gene regulatory relationships. Overall, the larger models exhibited superior performance, indicating their potential for specific tasks that involve the extraction of complex interactions among genes and proteins. Although these models possessed detailed information for distinct gene and protein groups, they faced challenges in identifying groups with diverse functions and in recognizing highly correlated gene regulatory relationships. Conclusions: By conducting a comprehensive assessment of the state-of-the-art models using well-established molecular interaction and pathway databases, our study reveals that LLMs can identify genes/proteins associated with pathways of interest and predict their interactions to a certain extent. Furthermore, these models can provide important insights, marking a noteworthy stride toward advancing our understanding of biological systems through AI-assisted knowledge discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Certified Mitigation of Worst-Case LLM Copyright Infringement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16046v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exposure of large language models (LLMs) to copyrighted material during pre-training raises concerns about unintentional copyright infringement post deployment. This has driven the development of "copyright takedown" methods, post-training approaches aimed at preventing models from generating content substantially similar to copyrighted ones. While current mitigation approaches are somewhat effective for average-case risks, we demonstrate that they overlook worst-case copyright risks exhibits by the existence of long, verbatim quotes from copyrighted sources. We propose BloomScrub, a remarkably simple yet highly effective inference-time approach that provides certified copyright takedown. Our method repeatedly interleaves quote detection with rewriting techniques to transform potentially infringing segments. By leveraging efficient data sketches (Bloom filters), our approach enables scalable copyright screening even for large-scale real-world corpora. When quotes beyond a length threshold cannot be removed, the system can abstain from responding, offering certified risk reduction. Experimental results show that BloomScrub reduces infringement risk, preserves utility, and accommodates different levels of enforcement stringency with adaptive abstention. Our results suggest that lightweight, inference-time methods can be surprisingly effective for copyright prevention.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Benchmarking Code LLMs for Android Malware Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00694v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in various code intelligence tasks. However, their effectiveness for Android malware analysis remains underexplored. Decompiled Android malware code presents unique challenges for analysis, due to the malicious logic being buried within a large number of functions and the frequent lack of meaningful function names. This paper presents CAMA, a benchmarking framework designed to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of Code LLMs in Android malware analysis. CAMA specifies structured model outputs to support key malware analysis tasks, including malicious function identification and malware purpose summarization. Built on these, it integrates three domain-specific evaluation metrics (consistency, fidelity, and semantic relevance), enabling rigorous stability and effectiveness assessment and cross-model comparison. We construct a benchmark dataset of 118 Android malware samples from 13 families collected in recent years, encompassing over 7.5 million distinct functions, and use CAMA to evaluate four popular open-source Code LLMs. Our experiments provide insights into how Code LLMs interpret decompiled code and quantify the sensitivity to function renaming, highlighting both their potential and current limitations in malware analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to the 34th ACM SIGSOFT ISSTA Companion (LLMSC Workshop 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Improving Significant Wave Height Prediction Using Chronos Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16834v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate wave height prediction is critical for maritime safety and coastal resilience, yet conventional physics-based models and traditional machine learning methods face challenges in computational efficiency and nonlinear dynamics modeling. This study introduces Chronos, the first implementation of a large language model (LLM)-powered temporal architecture (Chronos) optimized for wave forecasting. Through advanced temporal pattern recognition applied to historical wave data from three strategically chosen marine zones in the Northwest Pacific basin, our framework achieves multimodal improvements: (1) 14.3% reduction in training time with 2.5x faster inference speed compared to PatchTST baselines, achieving 0.575 mean absolute scaled error (MASE) units; (2) superior short-term forecasting (1-24h) across comprehensive metrics; (3) sustained predictive leadership in extended-range forecasts (1-120h); and (4) demonstrated zero-shot capability maintaining median performance (rank 4/12) against specialized operational models. This LLM-enhanced temporal modeling paradigm establishes a new standard in wave prediction, offering both computationally efficient solutions and a transferable framework for complex geophysical systems modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[LRASGen: LLM-based RESTful API Specification Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16833v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>REpresentation State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style for designing web applications that enable scalable, stateless communication between clients and servers via common HTTP techniques. Web APIs that employ the REST style are known as RESTful (or REST) APIs. When using or testing a RESTful API, developers may need to employ its specification, which is often defined by open-source standards such as the OpenAPI Specification (OAS). However, it can be very time-consuming and error-prone to write and update these specifications, which may negatively impact the use of RESTful APIs, especially when the software requirements change. Many tools and methods have been proposed to solve this problem, such as Respector and Swagger Core. OAS generation can be regarded as a common text-generation task that creates a formal description of API endpoints derived from the source code. A potential solution for this may involve using Large Language Models (LLMs), which have strong capabilities in both code understanding and text generation. Motivated by this, we propose a novel approach for generating the OASs of RESTful APIs using LLMs: LLM-based RESTful API-Specification Generation (LRASGen). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first use of LLMs and API source code to generate OASs for RESTful APIs. Compared with existing tools and methods, LRASGen can generate the OASs, even when the implementation is incomplete (with partial code, and/or missing annotations/comments, etc.). To evaluate the LRASGen performance, we conducted a series of empirical studies on 20 real-world RESTful APIs. The results show that two LLMs (GPT-4o mini and DeepSeek V3) can both support LARSGen to generate accurate specifications, and LRASGen-generated specifications cover an average of 48.85% more missed entities than the developer-provided specifications.</p></details> |  |
| **[GreenMind: A Next-Generation Vietnamese Large Language Model for Structured and Logical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16832v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is a robust approach for tackling LLM tasks that require intermediate reasoning steps prior to generating a final answer. In this paper, we present GreenMind-Medium-14B-R1, the Vietnamese reasoning model inspired by the finetuning strategy based on Group Relative Policy Optimization. We also leverage a high-quality Vietnamese synthesized reasoning dataset and design two reward functions to tackle the main limitations of this technique: (i) language mixing, where we explicitly detect the presence of biased language characters during the process of sampling tokens, and (ii) we leverage Sentence Transformer-based models to ensure that the generated reasoning content maintains factual correctness and does not distort the final output. Experimental results on the Vietnamese dataset from the VLSP 2023 Challenge demonstrate that our model outperforms prior works and enhances linguistic consistency in its responses. Furthermore, we extend our evaluation to SeaExam-a multilingual multiple-choice dataset, showing the effectiveness of our reasoning method compared to few-shot prompting techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChatDBG: Augmenting Debugging with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16354v4)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging is a critical but challenging task for programmers. This paper proposes ChatDBG, an AI-powered debugging assistant. ChatDBG integrates large language models (LLMs) to significantly enhance the capabilities and user-friendliness of conventional debuggers. ChatDBG lets programmers engage in a collaborative dialogue with the debugger, allowing them to pose complex questions about program state, perform root cause analysis for crashes or assertion failures, and explore open-ended queries like "why is x null?". To handle these queries, ChatDBG grants the LLM autonomy to "take the wheel": it can act as an independent agent capable of querying and controlling the debugger to navigate through stacks and inspect program state. It then reports its findings and yields back control to the programmer. By leveraging the real-world knowledge embedded in LLMs, ChatDBG can diagnose issues identifiable only through the use of domain-specific reasoning. Our ChatDBG prototype integrates with standard debuggers including LLDB and GDB for native code and Pdb for Python. Our evaluation across a diverse set of code, including C/C++ code with known bugs and a suite of Python code including standalone scripts and Jupyter notebooks, demonstrates that ChatDBG can successfully analyze root causes, explain bugs, and generate accurate fixes for a wide range of real-world errors. For the Python programs, a single query led to an actionable bug fix 67% of the time; one additional follow-up query increased the success rate to 85%. ChatDBG has seen rapid uptake; it has already been downloaded more than 75,000 times.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, to appear at FSE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Decoupled Global-Local Alignment for Improving Compositional Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16801v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has achieved success on multiple downstream tasks by aligning image and text modalities. However, the nature of global contrastive learning limits CLIP's ability to comprehend compositional concepts, such as relations and attributes. Although recent studies employ global hard negative samples to improve compositional understanding, these methods significantly compromise the model's inherent general capabilities by forcibly distancing textual negative samples from images in the embedding space. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a Decoupled Global-Local Alignment (DeGLA) framework that improves compositional understanding while substantially mitigating losses in general capabilities. To optimize the retention of the model's inherent capabilities, we incorporate a self-distillation mechanism within the global alignment process, aligning the learnable image-text encoder with a frozen teacher model derived from an exponential moving average. Under the constraint of self-distillation, it effectively mitigates the catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge during fine-tuning. To improve compositional understanding, we first leverage the in-context learning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct about 2M high-quality negative captions across five types. Subsequently, we propose the Image-Grounded Contrast (IGC) loss and Text-Grounded Contrast (TGC) loss to enhance vision-language compositionally. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the DeGLA framework. Compared to previous state-of-the-art methods, DeGLA achieves an average enhancement of 3.5% across the VALSE, SugarCrepe, and ARO benchmarks. Concurrently, it obtains an average performance improvement of 13.0% on zero-shot classification tasks across eleven datasets. Our code will be released at https://github.com/xiaoxing2001/DeGLA</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we propose MOOSComp, a token-classification-based long-context compression method that enhances the performance of a BERT-based compressor by mitigating the over-smoothing problem and incorporating outlier scores. In the training phase, we add an inter-class cosine similarity loss term to penalize excessively similar token representations, thereby improving the token classification accuracy. During the compression phase, we introduce outlier scores to preserve rare but critical tokens that are prone to be discarded in task-agnostic compression. These scores are integrated with the classifier's output, making the compressor more generalizable to various tasks. Superior performance is achieved at various compression ratios on long-context understanding and reasoning benchmarks. Moreover, our method obtains a speedup of 3.3x at a 4x compression ratio on a resource-constrained mobile device.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph2Nav: 3D Object-Relation Graph Generation to Robot Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16782v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Graph2Nav, a real-time 3D object-relation graph generation framework, for autonomous navigation in the real world. Our framework fully generates and exploits both 3D objects and a rich set of semantic relationships among objects in a 3D layered scene graph, which is applicable to both indoor and outdoor scenes. It learns to generate 3D semantic relations among objects, by leveraging and advancing state-of-the-art 2D panoptic scene graph works into the 3D world via 3D semantic mapping techniques. This approach avoids previous training data constraints in learning 3D scene graphs directly from 3D data. We conduct experiments to validate the accuracy in locating 3D objects and labeling object-relations in our 3D scene graphs. We also evaluate the impact of Graph2Nav via integration with SayNav, a state-of-the-art planner based on large language models, on an unmanned ground robot to object search tasks in real environments. Our results demonstrate that modeling object relations in our scene graphs improves search efficiency in these navigation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Effective are Generative Large Language Models in Performing Requirements Classification?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16768v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have revolutionised natural language processing (NLP), with generative models opening new possibilities for tasks that require context-aware text generation. Requirements engineering (RE) has also seen a surge in the experimentation of LLMs for different tasks, including trace-link detection, regulatory compliance, and others. Requirements classification is a common task in RE. While non-generative LLMs like BERT have been successfully applied to this task, there has been limited exploration of generative LLMs. This gap raises an important question: how well can generative LLMs, which produce context-aware outputs, perform in requirements classification? In this study, we explore the effectiveness of three generative LLMs-Bloom, Gemma, and Llama-in performing both binary and multi-class requirements classification. We design an extensive experimental study involving over 400 experiments across three widely used datasets (PROMISE NFR, Functional-Quality, and SecReq). Our study concludes that while factors like prompt design and LLM architecture are universally important, others-such as dataset variations-have a more situational impact, depending on the complexity of the classification task. This insight can guide future model development and deployment strategies, focusing on optimising prompt structures and aligning model architectures with task-specific needs for improved performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lightweight Latent Verifiers for Efficient Meta-Generation Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16760v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Verifiers are auxiliary models that assess the correctness of outputs generated by base large language models (LLMs). They play a crucial role in many strategies for solving reasoning-intensive problems with LLMs. Typically, verifiers are LLMs themselves, often as large (or larger) than the base model they support, making them computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce a novel lightweight verification approach, LiLaVe, which reliably extracts correctness signals from the hidden states of the base LLM. A key advantage of LiLaVe is its ability to operate with only a small fraction of the computational budget required by traditional LLM-based verifiers. To demonstrate its practicality, we couple LiLaVe with popular meta-generation strategies, like best-of-n or self-consistency. Moreover, we design novel LiLaVe-based approaches, like conditional self-correction or conditional majority voting, that significantly improve both accuracy and efficiency in generation tasks with smaller LLMs. Our work demonstrates the fruitfulness of extracting latent information from the hidden states of LLMs, and opens the door to scalable and resource-efficient solutions for reasoning-intensive applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[HEMA : A Hippocampus-Inspired Extended Memory Architecture for Long-Context AI Conversations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16754v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) struggle with maintaining coherence in extended conversations spanning hundreds of turns, despite performing well within their context windows. This paper introduces HEMA (Hippocampus-Inspired Extended Memory Architecture), a dual-memory system inspired by human cognitive processes. HEMA combines Compact Memory - a continuously updated one-sentence summary preserving global narrative coherence, and Vector Memory - an episodic store of chunk embeddings queried via cosine similarity. When integrated with a 6B-parameter transformer, HEMA maintains coherent dialogues beyond 300 turns while keeping prompt length under 3,500 tokens. Experimental results show substantial improvements: factual recall accuracy increases from 41% to 87%, and human-rated coherence improves from 2.7 to 4.3 on a 5-point scale. With 10K indexed chunks, Vector Memory achieves P@5 >= 0.80 and R@50 >= 0.74, doubling the area under the precision-recall curve compared to summarization-only approaches. Ablation studies reveal two key insights: semantic forgetting through age-weighted pruning reduces retrieval latency by 34% with minimal recall loss, and a two-level summary hierarchy prevents cascade errors in ultra-long conversations exceeding 1,000 turns. HEMA demonstrates that combining verbatim recall with semantic continuity provides a practical solution for privacy-aware conversational AI capable of month-long dialogues without model retraining.</p></details> |  |

However, these approaches critically depend on external supervision--such as human-labelled reasoning traces, verified golden answers, or pre-trained reward models--which limits scalability and practical applicability. In this work, we propose Entropy Minimized Policy Optimization (EMPO), which makes an early attempt at fully unsupervised LLM reasoning incentivization. EMPO does not require any supervised information for incentivizing reasoning capabilities (i.e., neither verifiable reasoning traces, problems with golden answers, nor additional pre-trained reward models). By continuously minimizing the predictive entropy of LLMs on unlabeled user queries in a latent semantic space, EMPO enables purely self-supervised evolution of reasoning capabilities with strong flexibility and practicality. Our experiments demonstrate competitive performance of EMPO on both mathematical reasoning and free-form natural reasoning tasks. Specifically, without any supervised signals, \ours boosts the accuracy of Qwen2.5-Math-7B Base from 30.7\% to 48.1\% on mathematical benchmarks and improves the accuracy of Qwen2.5-7B Base from 32.1\% to 50.1\% on MMLU-Pro.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ongoi...</summary><p>Ongoing work.

Many evaluations, however, rely on structured question-answer benchmarks, overlooking critical challenges of interpreting and reasoning about unstructured clinical narratives in real-world settings. Using free-text clinical descriptions, we present SemioLLM, an evaluation framework that benchmarks 6 state-of-the-art models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Mixtral-8x7B, Qwen-72B, LlaMa2, LlaMa3) on a core diagnostic task in epilepsy. Leveraging a database of 1,269 seizure descriptions, we show that most LLMs are able to accurately and confidently generate probabilistic predictions of seizure onset zones in the brain. Most models approach clinician-level performance after prompt engineering, with expert-guided chain-of-thought reasoning leading to the most consistent improvements. Performance was further strongly modulated by clinical in-context impersonation, narrative length and language context (13.7%, 32.7% and 14.2% performance variation, respectively). However, expert analysis of reasoning outputs revealed that correct prediction can be based on hallucinated knowledge and deficient source citation accuracy, underscoring the need to improve interpretability of LLMs in clinical use. Overall, SemioLLM provides a scalable, domain-adaptable framework for evaluating LLMs in clinical disciplines where unstructured verbal descriptions encode diagnostic information. By identifying both the strengths and limitations of state-of-the-art models, our work supports the development of clinically robust and globally applicable AI systems for healthcare.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of AI Agent Protocols](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16736v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has led to the widespread deployment of LLM agents across diverse industries, including customer service, content generation, data analysis, and even healthcare. However, as more LLM agents are deployed, a major issue has emerged: there is no standard way for these agents to communicate with external tools or data sources. This lack of standardized protocols makes it difficult for agents to work together or scale effectively, and it limits their ability to tackle complex, real-world tasks. A unified communication protocol for LLM agents could change this. It would allow agents and tools to interact more smoothly, encourage collaboration, and triggering the formation of collective intelligence. In this paper, we provide a systematic overview of existing communication protocols for LLM agents. We classify them into four main categories and make an analysis to help users and developers select the most suitable protocols for specific applications. Additionally, we conduct a comparative performance analysis of these protocols across key dimensions such as security, scalability, and latency. Finally, we explore future challenges, such as how protocols can adapt and survive in fast-evolving environments, and what qualities future protocols might need to support the next generation of LLM agent ecosystems. We expect this work to serve as a practical reference for both researchers and engineers seeking to design, evaluate, or integrate robust communication infrastructures for intelligent agents.</p></details> |  |

This work tackles the crucial first stage of research, generating novel hypotheses. While recent work on automated hypothesis generation focuses on multi-agent frameworks and extending test-time compute, none of the approaches effectively incorporate transparency and steerability through a synergistic Human-in-the-loop (HITL) approach. To address this gap, we introduce IRIS: Interactive Research Ideation System, an open-source platform designed for researchers to leverage LLM-assisted scientific ideation. IRIS incorporates innovative features to enhance ideation, including adaptive test-time compute expansion via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), fine-grained feedback mechanism, and query-based literature synthesis. Designed to empower researchers with greater control and insight throughout the ideation process.

As a result, recent efforts focus on instruction-tuning open-source LLMs, though the potential of combining them with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we are the first to explore a knowledge graph-based (KG) RAG framework for Japanese medical QA small-scale open-source LLMs. Experimental results show that KG-based RAG has only a limited impact on Japanese medical QA using small-scale open-source LLMs. Further case studies reveal that the effectiveness of the RAG is sensitive to the quality and relevance of the external retrieved content. These findings offer valuable insights into the challenges and potential of applying RAG in Japanese medical QA, while also serving as a reference for other low-resource languages.</p></details> | 10 pages |

It plays a crucial role in shaping our identity, making decisions, learning from past experiences, building relationships, and adapting to changes. In the era of large language models (LLMs), memory refers to the ability of an AI system to retain, recall, and use information from past interactions to improve future responses and interactions. Although previous research and reviews have provided detailed descriptions of memory mechanisms, there is still a lack of a systematic review that summarizes and analyzes the relationship between the memory of LLM-driven AI systems and human memory, as well as how we can be inspired by human memory to construct more powerful memory systems. To achieve this, in this paper, we propose a comprehensive survey on the memory of LLM-driven AI systems. In particular, we first conduct a detailed analysis of the categories of human memory and relate them to the memory of AI systems. Second, we systematically organize existing memory-related work and propose a categorization method based on three dimensions (object, form, and time) and eight quadrants. Finally, we illustrate some open problems regarding the memory of current AI systems and outline possible future directions for memory in the era of large language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables</p></details> |

These advances provide valuable tools for artists and enhance their creative processes, but they also raise concerns about copyright violations, consumer satisfaction, and content spamming. Previous research has explored content detection in various domains. However, no work has focused on the text modality, lyrics, in music. To address this gap, we curated a diverse dataset of real and synthetic lyrics from multiple languages, music genres, and artists. The generation pipeline was validated using both humans and automated methods. We performed a thorough evaluation of existing synthetic text detection approaches on lyrics, a previously unexplored data type. We also investigated methods to adapt the best-performing features to lyrics through unsupervised domain adaptation. Following both music and industrial constraints, we examined how well these approaches generalize across languages, scale with data availability, handle multilingual language content, and perform on novel genres in few-shot settings. Our findings show promising results that could inform policy decisions around AI-generated music and enhance transparency for users.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the TrustNLP Workshop at NAACL 2025</p></details> |

Despite the ubiquity of such post-training, a clear understanding of the dynamics that enable cross-lingual transfer remains elusive. This study examines cross-lingual transfer (CLT) dynamics in realistic post-training settings. We study two model families of up to 35B parameters in size trained on carefully controlled mixtures of multilingual data on three generative tasks with varying levels of complexity (summarization, instruction following, and mathematical reasoning) in both single-task and multi-task instruction tuning settings. Overall, we find that the dynamics of cross-lingual transfer and multilingual performance cannot be explained by isolated variables, varying depending on the combination of post-training settings. Finally, we identify the conditions that lead to effective cross-lingual transfer in practice.</p></details> |  |

However, the evaluation of these models' long-context abilities remains a challenge due to the limitations of current benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce NovelQA, a benchmark tailored for evaluating LLMs with complex, extended narratives. Constructed from English novels, NovelQA offers a unique blend of complexity, length, and narrative coherence, making it an ideal tool for assessing deep textual understanding in LLMs. This paper details the design and construction of NovelQA, focusing on its comprehensive manual annotation process and the variety of question types aimed at evaluating nuanced comprehension. Our evaluation of long-context LLMs on NovelQA reveals significant insights into their strengths and weaknesses. Notably, the models struggle with multi-hop reasoning, detail-oriented questions, and handling extremely long inputs, with average lengths exceeding 200,000 tokens. Results highlight the need for substantial advancements in LLMs to enhance their long-context comprehension and contribute effectively to computational literary analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR-2025</p></details> |

This research examines the trustworthiness of LLM-driven design insights, using qualitative coding as a case study to explore the interpretive processes central to RfD. We introduce LLMCode, an open-source tool integrating two metrics, namely Intersection over Union (IoU) and Modified Hausdorff Distance, to assess the alignment between human and LLM-generated insights. Across two studies involving 26 designers, we find that while the model performs well with deductive coding, its ability to emulate a designer's deeper interpretive lens over the data is limited, emphasising the importance of human-AI collaboration. Our results highlight a reciprocal dynamic where users refine LLM outputs and adapt their own perspectives based on the model's suggestions. These findings underscore the importance of fostering appropriate reliance on LLMs by designing tools that preserve interpretive depth while facilitating intuitive collaboration between designers and AI.</p></details> |  |

Traditionally, these tasks are often delegated to trained research assistants. Motivated by the advances in language modeling, empirical legal scholars are increasingly turning to prompting commercial models, hoping that it will alleviate the significant cost of human annotation. Despite growing use, our understanding of how to best utilize large language models for legal annotation remains limited. To bridge this gap, we introduce CaselawQA, a benchmark comprising 260 legal annotation tasks, nearly all new to the machine learning community. We demonstrate that commercial models, such as GPT-4.5 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet, achieve non-trivial yet highly variable accuracy, generally falling short of the performance required for legal work. We then demonstrate that small, lightly fine-tuned models outperform commercial models. A few hundred to a thousand labeled examples are usually enough to achieve higher accuracy. Our work points to a viable alternative to the predominant practice of prompting commercial models. For concrete legal annotation tasks with some available labeled data, researchers are likely better off using a fine-tuned open-source model.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

To this end, offline multiobjective alignment algorithms such as the Rewards-in-Context algorithm have shown strong performance and efficiency. However, inappropriate preference representations and training with imbalanced reward scores limit the performance of such algorithms. In this work, we introduce ParetoHqD that addresses the above issues by representing human preferences as preference directions in the objective space and regarding data near the Pareto front as ''high-quality'' data. For each preference, ParetoHqD follows a two-stage supervised fine-tuning process, where each stage uses an individual Pareto high-quality training set that best matches its preference direction. The experimental results have demonstrated the superiority of ParetoHqD over five baselines on two multiobjective alignment tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 6 figure, Multiobjective Alignment of LLMs</p></details> |

Creating high-quality AI system requirements is crucial for aligning the AI system with business goals and consumer values and for social responsibility. However, with the uncertain nature of AI systems and the heavy reliance on sensitive data, more research is needed to address the elicitation and analysis of AI systems requirements. With the proprietary nature of many AI systems, there is a lack of open-source requirements artifacts and technical requirements documents for AI systems, limiting broader research and investigation. With Large Language Models (LLMs) emerging as a promising alternative to human-generated text, this paper investigates the potential use of LLMs to generate user stories for AI systems based on abstracts from scholarly papers. We conducted an empirical evaluation using three LLMs and generated $1260$ user stories from $42$ abstracts from $26$ domains. We assess their quality using the Quality User Story (QUS) framework. Moreover, we identify relevant non-functional requirements (NFRs) and ethical principles. Our analysis demonstrates that the investigated LLMs can generate user stories inspired by the needs of various stakeholders, offering a promising approach for generating user stories for research purposes and for aiding in the early requirements elicitation phase of AI systems. We have compiled and curated a collection of stories generated by various LLMs into a dataset (UStAI), which is now publicly available for use.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a novel user-centric Interactive AI (IAI) approach for service management, with a distributed GDM-based AIGC framework that emphasizes efficient and cooperative deployment. The proposed method restructures the GDM inference process by allowing users with semantically similar prompts to share parts of the denoising chain. Furthermore, to maximize the users' subjective QoE, we propose an IAI approach, i.e., Reinforcement Learning With Large Language Models Interaction (RLLI), which utilizes Large Language Model (LLM)-empowered generative agents to replicate user interaction, providing real-time and subjective QoE feedback aligned with diverse user personalities. Lastly, we present the GDM-based Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (GDDPG) algorithm, adapted to the proposed RLLI framework, to allocate communication and computing resources effectively while accounting for subjective user traits and dynamic wireless conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that G-DDPG improves total QoE by 15% compared with the standard DDPG algorithm.</p></details> |  |

While existing evaluation studies primarily focus on unimodal (vision-only) comprehension and reasoning capabilities, they overlook critical assessments of complex multimodal reasoning tasks that require integrated understanding of both visual and textual contexts. Such multimodal tasks present unique challenges, demanding sophisticated reasoning across multiple modalities and deep comprehension of multimodal contexts. In this paper, we present MM-InstructEval, a comprehensive evaluation framework that incorporates diverse metrics to assess model performance across various multimodal reasoning tasks with vision-text contexts. We conduct extensive zero-shot evaluations on 45 models (including 36 MLLMs) across 16 multimodal datasets, encompassing 6 distinct tasks using 10 different instructions. Our framework introduces multiple innovative metrics, including the 'Best Performance' metric to benchmark peak model capabilities, the 'Mean Relative Gain' metric to assess overall efficacy across models and instructions, the 'Stability' metric to measure robustness, and the 'Adaptability' metric to quantify the compatibility between models and instructions. Through comprehensive evaluation and analysis, we uncover several significant insights about model architectures, instruction formats, and their interactions in multimodal reasoning tasks. Our findings establish new benchmarks for assessing the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs and provide strategic guidance for future developments.

We address this gap by evaluating the ability of GPT-4o, Llama 3, and Mistral to effectively apply counterspeech strategies derived from psychological research provided through structured prompts. Our results show that the models often generate generic, repetitive, or superficial results. Additionally, they over-acknowledge fear and frequently hallucinate facts, sources, or figures, making their prompt-based use in practical applications problematic.</p></details> | 15 pages |

However, existing few-shot TAL methods typically focus solely on video-level information, neglecting textual information, which can provide valuable semantic support for the localization task. Therefore, we propose a new few-shot temporal action localization method by Chain-of-Thought textual reasoning to improve localization performance. Specifically, we design a novel few-shot learning framework that leverages textual semantic information to enhance the model's ability to capture action commonalities and variations, which includes a semantic-aware text-visual alignment module designed to align the query and support videos at different levels. Meanwhile, to better express the temporal dependencies and causal relationships between actions at the textual level to assist action localization, we design a Chain of Thought (CoT)-like reasoning method that progressively guides the Vision Language Model (VLM) and Large Language Model (LLM) to generate CoT-like text descriptions for videos. The generated texts can capture more variance of action than visual features. We conduct extensive experiments on the publicly available ActivityNet1.3 and THUMOS14 datasets. We introduce the first dataset named Human-related Anomaly Localization and explore the application of the TAL task in human anomaly detection. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods in single-instance and multi-instance scenarios. We will release our code, data and benchmark.</p></details> |  |

The skeptical thinking of humankind could be useful for LLMs to self-cognition, self-reflection and alleviate their hallucinations. Inspired by this consideration, we propose a novel approach called LaMsS, which combines the semantic understanding capability of LLMs with self-skepticism. By introducing a series of skepticism tokens and augmenting them into the vocabulary, we conduct both pertaining and finetuning, which allow the LLM to decode each normal token followed by a skeptical token, representing different skepticism levels. By calculating the response skepticism given a query, one can define a new self-aware LLM which is only willing to answer with relative lower skepticism level than the threshold. By examining the accuracy, AUC and AP of willingly answering questions, we demonstrate that LaMsS achieves better performance than baselines on both multi-choice questions and open-domain question-answering benchmarks, and can generalize to multi-task and out-of-domain settings. Our study sheds some lights on the self-skepticism modeling on further artificial intelligence.

However, their reliance on cloud infrastructure and substantial computational requirements pose challenges for analyzing sensitive or proprietary codebases due to privacy concerns and inference costs. This work explores the potential of Small Language Models (SLMs) as a viable alternative for accurate, on-premise vulnerability detection. We investigated whether a 350-million parameter pre-trained code model (codegen-mono) could be effectively fine-tuned to detect the MITRE Top 25 CWEs specifically within Python code. To facilitate this, we developed a targeted dataset of 500 examples using a semi-supervised approach involving LLM-driven synthetic data generation coupled with meticulous human review. Initial tests confirmed that the base codegen-mono model completely failed to identify CWEs in our samples. However, after applying instruction-following fine-tuning, the specialized SLM achieved remarkable performance on our test set, yielding approximately 99% accuracy, 98.08% precision, 100% recall, and a 99.04% F1-score. These results strongly suggest that fine-tuned SLMs can serve as highly accurate and efficient tools for CWE detection, offering a practical and privacy-preserving solution for integrating advanced security analysis directly into development workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables.

Yet their performance is highly sensitive to prompt formulation. While automated prompt optimization addresses this challenge by finding optimal prompts, current methods require a substantial number of LLM calls and input tokens, making prompt optimization expensive. We introduce CAPO (Cost-Aware Prompt Optimization), an algorithm that enhances prompt optimization efficiency by integrating AutoML techniques. CAPO is an evolutionary approach with LLMs as operators, incorporating racing to save evaluations and multi-objective optimization to balance performance with prompt length. It jointly optimizes instructions and few-shot examples while leveraging task descriptions for improved robustness. Our extensive experiments across diverse datasets and LLMs demonstrate that CAPO outperforms state-of-the-art discrete prompt optimization methods in 11/15 cases with improvements up to 21%p. Our algorithm achieves better performances already with smaller budgets, saves evaluations through racing, and decreases average prompt length via a length penalty, making it both cost-efficient and cost-aware. Even without few-shot examples, CAPO outperforms its competitors and generally remains robust to initial prompts. CAPO represents an important step toward making prompt optimization more powerful and accessible by improving cost-efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to AutoML 2025</p></details> |

However, the high costs associated with such exceptional performance limit the widespread adoption of LLMs, highlighting the need for prompt compression. Existing prompt compression methods primarily rely on heuristic truncation or abstractive summarization techniques, which fundamentally overlook the intrinsic mechanisms of LLMs and lack a systematic evaluation of token importance for generation. In this work, we introduce Prompt Importance Sampling (PIS), a novel compression framework that dynamically compresses prompts by sampling important tokens based on the analysis of attention scores of hidden states. PIS employs a dual-level compression mechanism: 1) at the token level, we quantify saliency using LLM-native attention scores and implement adaptive compression through a lightweight 9-layer reinforcement learning (RL) network; 2) at the semantic level, we propose a Russian roulette sampling strategy for sentence-level importance sampling. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple domain benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art compression performance. Notably, our framework serendipitously enhances reasoning efficiency through optimized context structuring.

| **[Enhancing LLM-Based Agents via Global Planning and Hierarchical Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16563v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intelligent agent systems based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in real-world applications. However, existing agent frameworks still face critical limitations in task planning and execution, restricting their effectiveness and generalizability. Specifically, current planning methods often lack clear global goals, leading agents to get stuck in local branches, or produce non-executable plans. Meanwhile, existing execution mechanisms struggle to balance complexity and stability, and their limited action space restricts their ability to handle diverse real-world tasks. To address these limitations, we propose GoalAct, a novel agent framework that introduces a continuously updated global planning mechanism and integrates a hierarchical execution strategy. GoalAct decomposes task execution into high-level skills, including searching, coding, writing and more, thereby reducing planning complexity while enhancing the agents' adaptability across diverse task scenarios. We evaluate GoalAct on LegalAgentBench, a benchmark with multiple types of legal tasks that require the use of multiple types of tools. Experimental results demonstrate that GoalAct achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, with an average improvement of 12.22% in success rate. These findings highlight GoalAct's potential to drive the development of more advanced intelligent agent systems, making them more effective across complex real-world applications.

However, limited research has been conducted on how prompt strategies in large language model (LLM)-powered SAV User Interfaces (UIs) affect users' perceptions, experiences, and intentions to adopt such technology. In this work, we investigate how conversational UIs powered by LLMs drive these psychological factors and psychological ownership, the sense of possession a user may come to feel towards an entity or object they may not legally own. We designed four SAV UIs with varying levels of anthropomorphic characteristics and psychological ownership triggers. Quantitative measures of psychological ownership, anthropomorphism, quality of service, disclosure tendency, sentiment of SAV responses, and overall acceptance were collected after participants interacted with each SAV. Qualitative feedback was also gathered regarding the experience of psychological ownership during the interactions. The results indicate that an SAV conversational UI designed to be more anthropomorphic and to induce psychological ownership improved users' perceptions of the SAV's human-like qualities and improved the sentiment of responses compared to a control condition. These findings provide practical guidance for designing LLM-based conversational UIs that enhance user experience and adoption of SAVs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tinkering Against Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16546v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ascent of scaling in artificial intelligence research has revolutionized the field over the past decade, yet it presents significant challenges for academic researchers, particularly in computational social science and critical algorithm studies. The dominance of large language models, characterized by their extensive parameters and costly training processes, creates a disparity where only industry-affiliated researchers can access these resources. This imbalance restricts academic researchers from fully understanding their tools, leading to issues like reproducibility in computational social science and a reliance on black-box metaphors in critical studies. To address these challenges, we propose a "tinkering" approach that is inspired by existing works. This method involves engaging with smaller models or components that are manageable for ordinary researchers, fostering hands-on interaction with algorithms. We argue that tinkering is both a way of making and knowing for computational social science and a way of knowing for critical studies, and fundamentally, it is a way of caring that has broader implications for both fields.</p></details> | 43 pages, 4 figures |

To address this challenge, we introduce an Integrated Communication and Computing (ICC) framework where computing capabilities are enabled to reside directly in radio access network (RAN) nodes and jointly manage bandwidth and computing resources. Our queueing-theoretic analysis shows that ICC outperforms 5G MEC, achieving higher service capacity (defined as the maximum arrival rate that maintains a specified fraction of jobs completed within a given delay budget) by 98%. We corroborate these gains through system-level simulations that account for transformer-based LLM workloads, realistic GPU specifications, and a priority-based scheduling scheme. The simulations show that ICC improves service capacity by 60%, demonstrating its potential to enable efficient, cost-effective real-time GenAI services in 6G.</p></details> |  |
| **[QuaDMix: Quality-Diversity Balanced Data Selection for Efficient LLM Pretraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16511v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quality and diversity are two critical metrics for the training data of large language models (LLMs), positively impacting performance. Existing studies often optimize these metrics separately, typically by first applying quality filtering and then adjusting data proportions. However, these approaches overlook the inherent trade-off between quality and diversity, necessitating their joint consideration. Given a fixed training quota, it is essential to evaluate both the quality of each data point and its complementary effect on the overall dataset. In this paper, we introduce a unified data selection framework called QuaDMix, which automatically optimizes the data distribution for LLM pretraining while balancing both quality and diversity. Specifically, we first propose multiple criteria to measure data quality and employ domain classification to distinguish data points, thereby measuring overall diversity. QuaDMix then employs a unified parameterized data sampling function that determines the sampling probability of each data point based on these quality and diversity related labels. To accelerate the search for the optimal parameters involved in the QuaDMix framework, we conduct simulated experiments on smaller models and use LightGBM for parameters searching, inspired by the RegMix method. Our experiments across diverse models and datasets demonstrate that QuaDMix achieves an average performance improvement of 7.2% across multiple benchmarks. These results outperform the independent strategies for quality and diversity, highlighting the necessity and ability to balance data quality and diversity.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comprehensive Survey of Synthetic Tabular Data Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16506v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tabular data remains one of the most prevalent and critical data formats across diverse real-world applications. However, its effective use in machine learning (ML) is often constrained by challenges such as data scarcity, privacy concerns, and class imbalance. Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising solution, leveraging generative models to learn the distribution of real datasets and produce high-fidelity, privacy-preserving samples. Various generative paradigms have been explored, including energy-based models (EBMs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), large language models (LLMs), and diffusion models. While several surveys have investigated synthetic tabular data generation, most focus on narrow subdomains or specific generative methods, such as GANs, diffusion models, or privacy-preserving techniques. This limited scope often results in fragmented insights, lacking a comprehensive synthesis that bridges diverse approaches. In particular, recent advances driven by LLMs and diffusion-based models remain underexplored. This gap hinders a holistic understanding of the field`s evolution, methodological interplay, and open challenges. To address this, our survey provides a unified and systematic review of synthetic tabular data generation. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we propose a comprehensive taxonomy that organizes existing methods into traditional approaches, diffusion-based methods, and LLM-based models, and provide an in-depth comparative analysis; (2) we detail the complete pipeline for synthetic tabular data generation, including data synthesis, post-processing, and evaluation; (3) we identify major challenges, explore real-world applications, and outline open research questions and future directions to guide future work in this rapidly evolving area.</p></details> |  |

We present TraveLLaMA, a specialized multimodal language model designed for urban scene understanding and travel assistance. Our work addresses the fundamental challenge of developing practical AI travel assistants through a novel large-scale dataset of 220k question-answer pairs. This comprehensive dataset uniquely combines 130k text QA pairs meticulously curated from authentic travel forums with GPT-enhanced responses, alongside 90k vision-language QA pairs specifically focused on map understanding and scene comprehension. Through extensive fine-tuning experiments on state-of-the-art vision-language models (LLaVA, Qwen-VL, Shikra), we demonstrate significant performance improvements ranging from 6.5\%-9.4\% in both pure text travel understanding and visual question answering tasks. Our model exhibits exceptional capabilities in providing contextual travel recommendations, interpreting map locations, and understanding place-specific imagery while offering practical information such as operating hours and visitor reviews. Comparative evaluations show TraveLLaMA significantly outperforms general-purpose models in travel-specific tasks, establishing a new benchmark for multi-modal travel assistance systems.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents an AI-powered depression prevention system that leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze real-time conversational cues--including subtle emotional expressions (e.g., micro-sentiment shifts, self-referential language patterns)--for more accurate and dynamic mental state assessment. Our system achieves three key innovations: (1) Continuous monitoring through natural dialogue, detecting depression-indicative linguistic features (anhedonia markers, hopelessness semantics) with 89% precision (vs. 72% for PHQ-9); (2) Adaptive risk stratification that updates severity levels based on conversational context, reducing false positives by 41% compared to scale-based thresholds; and (3) Personalized intervention strategies tailored to users' emotional granularity, demonstrating 2.3x higher adherence rates than generic advice. Clinical validation with 450 participants shows the system identifies 92% of at-risk cases missed by traditional scales, while its explainable AI interface bridges the gap between automated analysis and clinician judgment. This work establishes conversational AI as a paradigm shift from episodic scale-dependent diagnosis to continuous, emotionally intelligent mental health monitoring.</p></details> |  |
| **[Amplified Vulnerabilities: Structured Jailbreak Attacks on LLM-based Multi-Agent Debate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16489v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Agent Debate (MAD), leveraging collaborative interactions among Large Language Models (LLMs), aim to enhance reasoning capabilities in complex tasks. However, the security implications of their iterative dialogues and role-playing characteristics, particularly susceptibility to jailbreak attacks eliciting harmful content, remain critically underexplored. This paper systematically investigates the jailbreak vulnerabilities of four prominent MAD frameworks built upon leading commercial LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, and DeepSeek) without compromising internal agents. We introduce a novel structured prompt-rewriting framework specifically designed to exploit MAD dynamics via narrative encapsulation, role-driven escalation, iterative refinement, and rhetorical obfuscation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MAD systems are inherently more vulnerable than single-agent setups. Crucially, our proposed attack methodology significantly amplifies this fragility, increasing average harmfulness from 28.14% to 80.34% and achieving attack success rates as high as 80% in certain scenarios. These findings reveal intrinsic vulnerabilities in MAD architectures and underscore the urgent need for robust, specialized defenses prior to real-world deployment.</p></details> | 33 pages, 5 figures |

In many real-world tasks, decisions depend on details scattered across collections of often disparate documents containing mostly irrelevant information. Long-context LLMs appear well-suited to this form of complex information retrieval and reasoning, which has traditionally proven costly and time-consuming. However, although the development of longer context models has seen rapid gains in recent years, our understanding of how effectively LLMs use their context has not kept pace. To address this, we conduct a set of retrieval experiments designed to evaluate the capabilities of 17 leading LLMs, such as their ability to follow threads of information through the context window. Strikingly, we find that many models are remarkably threadsafe: capable of simultaneously following multiple threads without significant loss in performance. Still, for many models, we find the effective context limit is significantly shorter than the supported context length, with accuracy decreasing as the context window grows. Our study also highlights the important point that token counts from different tokenizers should not be directly compared -- they often correspond to substantially different numbers of written characters. We release our code and long-context experimental data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Retrieving this information correctly is essential in financial Question-Answering (QA), since many language models struggle with factual accuracy in this domain. We present FinDER, an expert-generated dataset tailored for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in finance. Unlike existing QA datasets that provide predefined contexts and rely on relatively clear and straightforward queries, FinDER focuses on annotating search-relevant evidence by domain experts, offering 5,703 query-evidence-answer triplets derived from real-world financial inquiries. These queries frequently include abbreviations, acronyms, and concise expressions, capturing the brevity and ambiguity common in the realistic search behavior of professionals. By challenging models to retrieve relevant information from large corpora rather than relying on readily determined contexts, FinDER offers a more realistic benchmark for evaluating RAG systems. We further present a comprehensive evaluation of multiple state-of-the-art retrieval models and Large Language Models, showcasing challenges derived from a realistic benchmark to drive future research on truthful and precise RAG in the financial domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, ICLR 2025 Workshop Advances in Financial AI</p></details> |

We show that these concepts raise exciting new challenges in the context of Large Language Models for software test generation. More specifically, we formally define and investigate the properties of hardening and catching tests. A hardening test is one that seeks to protect against future regressions, while a catching test is one that catches such a regression or a fault in new functionality introduced by a code change. Hardening tests can be generated at any time and may become catching tests when a future regression is caught. We also define and motivate the Catching `Just-in-Time' (JiTTest) Challenge, in which tests are generated `just-in-time' to catch new faults before they land into production. We show that any solution to Catching JiTTest generation can also be repurposed to catch latent faults in legacy code. We enumerate possible outcomes for hardening and catching tests and JiTTests, and discuss open research problems, deployment options, and initial results from our work on automated LLM-based hardening at Meta.

However, it is yet unclear how good LLMs are at automating comprehensive and reliable literature reviews. This study introduces a framework to automatically evaluate the performance of LLMs in three key tasks of literature writing: reference generation, literature summary, and literature review composition. We introduce multidimensional evaluation metrics that assess the hallucination rates in generated references and measure the semantic coverage and factual consistency of the literature summaries and compositions against human-written counterparts. The experimental results reveal that even the most advanced models still generate hallucinated references, despite recent progress. Moreover, we observe that the performance of different models varies across disciplines when it comes to writing literature reviews. These findings highlight the need for further research and development to improve the reliability of LLMs in automating academic literature reviews.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Methods like EAGLE perform autoregression at the feature level, reusing top-layer features from the target model to achieve better results than vanilla speculative sampling. A growing trend in the LLM community is scaling up training data to improve model intelligence without increasing inference costs. However, we observe that scaling up data provides limited improvements for EAGLE. We identify that this limitation arises from EAGLE's feature prediction constraints. In this paper, we introduce EAGLE-3, which abandons feature prediction in favor of direct token prediction and replaces reliance on top-layer features with multi-layer feature fusion via a technique named training-time test. These improvements significantly enhance performance and enable the draft model to fully benefit from scaling up training data. Our experiments include both chat models and reasoning models, evaluated on five tasks. The results show that EAGLE-3 achieves a speedup ratio up to 6.5x, with about 1.4x improvement over EAGLE-2. In the SGLang framework, EAGLE-3 achieves a 1.38x throughput improvement at a batch size of 64. The code is available at https://github.com/SafeAILab/EAGLE.</p></details> |  |

However, the existing approaches to fine-tune LLMs for RTL generation typically are conducted on fixed datasets, which do not fully stimulate the capability of LLMs and require large amounts of reference data, which are costly to acquire. To mitigate these issues, we innovatively introduce an iterative training paradigm named ITERTL. During each iteration, samples are drawn from the model trained in the previous cycle. Then these new samples are employed for training in current loop. Furthermore, we introduce a plug-and-play data filtering strategy, thereby encouraging the model to generate high-quality, self-contained code. Our model outperforms GPT4 and state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source models, achieving remarkable 53.8% pass@1 rate on VerilogEval-human benchmark. Under similar conditions of data quantity and quality, our approach significantly outperforms the baseline. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods, which operate at the document level, fail to effectively filter out such content. We propose LLM-driven chunk filtering, ChunkRAG, a framework that enhances RAG systems by evaluating and filtering retrieved information at the chunk level. Our approach employs semantic chunking to divide documents into coherent sections and utilizes LLM-based relevance scoring to assess each chunk's alignment with the user's query. By filtering out less pertinent chunks before the generation phase, we significantly reduce hallucinations and improve factual accuracy. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing RAG models, achieving higher accuracy on tasks requiring precise information retrieval. This advancement enhances the reliability of RAG systems, making them particularly beneficial for applications like fact-checking and multi-hop reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, Student Research Workshop 2025 (NAACL SRW 2025)</p></details> |

Traditional methods, relying on rule-based or shallow machine learning techniques, struggle to capture deep and implicit semantics. Recently, large pre-trained language models and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a lightweight fine-tuning method, have shown promise for structured information extraction. We propose EMRModel, a novel approach that integrates LoRA-based fine-tuning with code-style prompt design, aiming to efficiently convert medical consultation dialogues into structured electronic medical records (EMRs). Additionally, we construct a high-quality, realistically grounded dataset of medical consultation dialogues with detailed annotations. Furthermore, we introduce a fine-grained evaluation benchmark for medical consultation information extraction and provide a systematic evaluation methodology, advancing the optimization of medical natural language processing (NLP) models. Experimental results show EMRModel achieves an F1 score of 88.1%, improving by49.5% over standard pre-trained models. Compared to traditional LoRA fine-tuning methods, our model shows superior performance, highlighting its effectiveness in structured medical record extraction tasks.</p></details> |  |

With recent advances in large language models (LLMs), this approach has shown growing potential in capturing individual differences and predicting group behaviors. However, existing methods face alignment challenges related to the environment, target users, interaction mechanisms, and behavioral patterns. To this end, we introduce SocioVerse, an LLM-agent-driven world model for social simulation. Our framework features four powerful alignment components and a user pool of 10 million real individuals. To validate its effectiveness, we conducted large-scale simulation experiments across three distinct domains: politics, news, and economics. Results demonstrate that SocioVerse can reflect large-scale population dynamics while ensuring diversity, credibility, and representativeness through standardized procedures and minimal manual adjustments.</p></details> | work in progress |
| **[MegaScale-Infer: Serving Mixture-of-Experts at Scale with Disaggregated Expert Parallelism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02263v3)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) showcases tremendous potential to scale large language models (LLMs) with enhanced performance and reduced computational complexity. However, its sparsely activated architecture shifts feed-forward networks (FFNs) from being compute-intensive to memory-intensive during inference, leading to substantially lower GPU utilization and increased operational costs. We present MegaScale-Infer, an efficient and cost-effective system for serving large-scale MoE models. MegaScale-Infer disaggregates attention and FFN modules within each model layer, enabling independent scaling, tailored parallelism strategies, and heterogeneous deployment for both modules. To fully exploit disaggregation in the presence of MoE's sparsity, MegaScale-Infer introduces ping-pong pipeline parallelism, which partitions a request batch into micro-batches and shuttles them between attention and FFNs for inference. Combined with distinct model parallelism for each module, MegaScale-Infer effectively hides communication overhead and maximizes GPU utilization. To adapt to disaggregated attention and FFN modules and minimize data transmission overhead (e.g., token dispatch), MegaScale-Infer provides a high-performance M2N communication library that eliminates unnecessary GPU-to-CPU data copies, group initialization overhead, and GPU synchronization. Experimental results indicate that MegaScale-Infer achieves up to 1.90x higher per-GPU throughput than state-of-the-art solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Give LLMs a Security Course: Securing Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation via Knowledge Injection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16429v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG) leverages external knowledge to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) in code synthesis, improving the functional correctness of the generated code. However, existing RACG systems largely overlook security, leading to substantial risks. Especially, the poisoning of malicious code into knowledge bases can mislead LLMs, resulting in the generation of insecure outputs, which poses a critical threat in modern software development. To address this, we propose a security-hardening framework for RACG systems, CodeGuarder, that shifts the paradigm from retrieving only functional code examples to incorporating both functional code and security knowledge. Our framework constructs a security knowledge base from real-world vulnerability databases, including secure code samples and root cause annotations. For each code generation query, a retriever decomposes the query into fine-grained sub-tasks and fetches relevant security knowledge. To prioritize critical security guidance, we introduce a re-ranking and filtering mechanism by leveraging the LLMs' susceptibility to different vulnerability types. This filtered security knowledge is seamlessly integrated into the generation prompt. Our evaluation shows CodeGuarder significantly improves code security rates across various LLMs, achieving average improvements of 20.12\% in standard RACG, and 31.53\% and 21.91\% under two distinct poisoning scenarios without compromising functional correctness. Furthermore, CodeGuarder demonstrates strong generalization, enhancing security even when the targeted language's security knowledge is lacking. This work presents CodeGuarder as a pivotal advancement towards building secure and trustworthy RACG systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Large Language Models Help Multimodal Language Analysis? MMLA: A Comprehensive Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16427v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal language analysis is a rapidly evolving field that leverages multiple modalities to enhance the understanding of high-level semantics underlying human conversational utterances. Despite its significance, little research has investigated the capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to comprehend cognitive-level semantics. In this paper, we introduce MMLA, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to address this gap. MMLA comprises over 61K multimodal utterances drawn from both staged and real-world scenarios, covering six core dimensions of multimodal semantics: intent, emotion, dialogue act, sentiment, speaking style, and communication behavior. We evaluate eight mainstream branches of LLMs and MLLMs using three methods: zero-shot inference, supervised fine-tuning, and instruction tuning. Extensive experiments reveal that even fine-tuned models achieve only about 60%~70% accuracy, underscoring the limitations of current MLLMs in understanding complex human language. We believe that MMLA will serve as a solid foundation for exploring the potential of large language models in multimodal language analysis and provide valuable resources to advance this field. The datasets and code are open-sourced at https://github.com/thuiar/MMLA.</p></details> | 23 pages, 5 figures |

While these LLMs offer considerable convenience, they also raise security concerns, as LLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks by some well-designed textual perturbations. In this paper, we introduce a novel defense technique named Large LAnguage MOdel Sentinel (LLAMOS), which is designed to enhance the adversarial robustness of LLMs by purifying the adversarial textual examples before feeding them into the target LLM. Our method comprises two main components: a) Agent instruction, which can simulate a new agent for adversarial defense, altering minimal characters to maintain the original meaning of the sentence while defending against attacks; b) Defense guidance, which provides strategies for modifying clean or adversarial examples to ensure effective defense and accurate outputs from the target LLMs. Remarkably, the defense agent demonstrates robust defensive capabilities even without learning from adversarial examples. Additionally, we conduct an intriguing adversarial experiment where we develop two agents, one for defense and one for attack, and engage them in mutual confrontation. During the adversarial interactions, neither agent completely beat the other. Extensive experiments on both open-source and closed-source LLMs demonstrate that our method effectively defends against adversarial attacks, thereby enhancing adversarial robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAOTE: KV Caching through Attention Output Error based Token Eviction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14051v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While long context support of large language models has extended their abilities, it also incurs challenges in memory and compute which becomes crucial bottlenecks in resource-restricted devices. Token eviction, a widely adopted post-training methodology designed to alleviate the bottlenecks by evicting less important tokens from the cache, typically uses attention scores as proxy metrics for token importance. However, one major limitation of attention score as a token-wise importance metrics is that it lacks the information about contribution of tokens to the attention output. In this paper, we propose a simple eviction criterion based on the contribution of cached tokens to attention outputs. Our method, CAOTE, optimizes for eviction error due to token eviction, by seamlessly integrating attention scores and value vectors. This is the first method which uses value vector information on top of attention-based eviction scores. Additionally, CAOTE can act as a meta-heuristic method with flexible usage with any token eviction method. We show that CAOTE, when combined with the state-of-the-art attention score-based methods, always improves accuracies on the downstream task, indicating the importance of leveraging information from values during token eviction process.</p></details> | 14 pages, 2 figures |

With the Mistral-7B-Instruct model applied with a Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method and a 4-bit quantization method, the model underwent training in two distinct stages related to this study's purpose to enhance domain specificity while maintaining computational efficiency. In Phase 1, the model was conditioned with a synthetic dataset via the Gemini Pro API, and in Phase 2, it was trained with manually curated datasets from the StudyAbroadGPT project to achieve enhanced, contextualized responses. Technical innovations entailed memory-efficient quantization, parameter-efficient adaptation, and continuous training analytics via Weights & Biases. After training, this study demonstrated a reduction in training loss by 52.7%, 92% accuracy in domain-specific recommendations, achieved 95% markdown-based formatting support, and a median run-rate of 100 samples per second on off-the-shelf GPU equipment. These findings support the effective application of instruction-tuned LLMs within educational advisers, especially in low-resource institutional scenarios. Limitations included decreased generalizability and the application of a synthetically generated dataset, but this framework is scalable for adding new multilingual-augmented and real-time academic advising processes. Future directions may include plans for the integration of retrieval-augmented generation, applying dynamic quantization routines, and connecting to real-time academic databases to increase adaptability and accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures (3 graphs + 3 flowchart/architecture diagrams), submitted as a preprint for review consideration in AI for Education or Machine Learning applications in low-resource settings.

| **[Evaluating Multi-Hop Reasoning in Large Language Models: A Chemistry-Centric Case Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16414v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we introduced a new benchmark consisting of a curated dataset and a defined evaluation process to assess the compositional reasoning capabilities of large language models within the chemistry domain. We designed and validated a fully automated pipeline, verified by subject matter experts, to facilitate this task. Our approach integrates OpenAI reasoning models with named entity recognition (NER) systems to extract chemical entities from recent literature, which are then augmented with external knowledge bases to form a comprehensive knowledge graph. By generating multi-hop questions across these graphs, we assess LLM performance in both context-augmented and non-context augmented settings. Our experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art models face significant challenges in multi-hop compositional reasoning. The results reflect the importance of augmenting LLMs with document retrieval, which can have a substantial impact on improving their performance. However, even perfect retrieval accuracy with full context does not eliminate reasoning errors, underscoring the complexity of compositional reasoning. This work not only benchmarks and highlights the limitations of current LLMs but also presents a novel data generation pipeline capable of producing challenging reasoning datasets across various domains. Overall, this research advances our understanding of reasoning in computational linguistics.</p></details> |  |

Previous methods have relied on extensive training data for fine-tuning models, leading to challenges in terms of labor and resource costs. We propose PonTE, a novel unsupervised conditional text embedding method that leverages a causal large language model and a conditional prompt. Through experiments on conditional semantic text similarity and text clustering, we demonstrate that PonTE can generate useful conditional text embeddings and achieve performance comparable to supervised methods without fine-tuning. We also show the interpretability of text embeddings with PonTE by analyzing word generation following prompts and embedding visualization.</p></details> | work in progress |
| **[EEmo-Bench: A Benchmark for Multi-modal Large Language Models on Image Evoked Emotion Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16405v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The furnishing of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has led to the emergence of numerous benchmark studies, particularly those evaluating their perception and understanding capabilities. Among these, understanding image-evoked emotions aims to enhance MLLMs' empathy, with significant applications such as human-machine interaction and advertising recommendations. However, current evaluations of this MLLM capability remain coarse-grained, and a systematic and comprehensive assessment is still lacking. To this end, we introduce EEmo-Bench, a novel benchmark dedicated to the analysis of the evoked emotions in images across diverse content categories. Our core contributions include: 1) Regarding the diversity of the evoked emotions, we adopt an emotion ranking strategy and employ the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) as emotional attributes for emotional assessment. In line with this methodology, 1,960 images are collected and manually annotated. 2) We design four tasks to evaluate MLLMs' ability to capture the evoked emotions by single images and their associated attributes: Perception, Ranking, Description, and Assessment. Additionally, image-pairwise analysis is introduced to investigate the model's proficiency in performing joint and comparative analysis. In total, we collect 6,773 question-answer pairs and perform a thorough assessment on 19 commonly-used MLLMs. The results indicate that while some proprietary and large-scale open-source MLLMs achieve promising overall performance, the analytical capabilities in certain evaluation dimensions remain suboptimal. Our EEmo-Bench paves the path for further research aimed at enhancing the comprehensive perceiving and understanding capabilities of MLLMs concerning image-evoked emotions, which is crucial for machine-centric emotion perception and understanding.</p></details> |  |

Evaluating TST outputs is a multidimensional challenge, requiring the assessment of style transfer accuracy, content preservation, and naturalness. Using human evaluation is ideal but costly, as is common in other natural language processing (NLP) tasks, however, automatic metrics for TST have not received as much attention as metrics for, e.g., machine translation or summarization. In this paper, we examine both set of existing and novel metrics from broader NLP tasks for TST evaluation, focusing on two popular subtasks, sentiment transfer and detoxification, in a multilingual context comprising English, Hindi, and Bengali. By conducting meta-evaluation through correlation with human judgments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these metrics when used individually and in ensembles. Additionally, we investigate the potential of large language models (LLMs) as tools for TST evaluation. Our findings highlight newly applied advanced NLP metrics and LLM-based evaluations provide better insights than existing TST metrics. Our oracle ensemble approaches show even more potential.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NAACL SRW 2025</p></details> |

However, whether multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can similarly understand the 4D world remains uncertain. This paper explores multimodal spatial-temporal reasoning from an egocentric perspective, aiming to equip MLLMs with human-like reasoning capabilities. To support this objective, we introduce \textbf{Ego-ST Bench}, a novel benchmark containing over 5,000 question-answer pairs across four categories, systematically evaluating spatial, temporal, and integrated spatial-temporal reasoning. Additionally, we propose \textbf{ST-R1} training paradigm, a video-based reasoning model that incorporates reverse thinking into its reinforcement learning process, significantly enhancing performance. We combine long-chain-of-thought (long-CoT) supervised fine-tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning, achieving notable improvements with limited high-quality data. Ego-ST Bench and ST-R1 provide valuable insights and resources for advancing video-based spatial-temporal reasoning research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sustainability via LLM Right-sizing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13217v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly embedded in organizational workflows. This has raised concerns over their energy consumption, financial costs, and data sovereignty. While performance benchmarks often celebrate cutting-edge models, real-world deployment decisions require a broader perspective: when is a smaller, locally deployable model "good enough"? This study offers an empirical answer by evaluating eleven proprietary and open-weight LLMs across ten everyday occupational tasks, including summarizing texts, generating schedules, and drafting emails and proposals. Using a dual-LLM-based evaluation framework, we automated task execution and standardized evaluation across ten criteria related to output quality, factual accuracy, and ethical responsibility. Results show that GPT-4o delivers consistently superior performance but at a significantly higher cost and environmental footprint. Notably, smaller models like Gemma-3 and Phi-4 achieved strong and reliable results on most tasks, suggesting their viability in contexts requiring cost-efficiency, local deployment, or privacy. A cluster analysis revealed three model groups -- premium all-rounders, competent generalists, and limited but safe performers -- highlighting trade-offs between quality, control, and sustainability. Significantly, task type influenced model effectiveness: conceptual tasks challenged most models, while aggregation and transformation tasks yielded better performances. We argue for a shift from performance-maximizing benchmarks to task- and context-aware sufficiency assessments that better reflect organizational priorities. Our approach contributes a scalable method to evaluate AI models through a sustainability lens and offers actionable guidance for responsible LLM deployment in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 2 Figures, 6 Tables</p></details> |

However, LLMs are generalized models, trained on extensive text corpus, and often struggle to provide context-specific information, particularly in areas requiring specialized knowledge, such as wildfire details within the broader context of climate change. For decision-makers focused on wildfire resilience and adaptation, it is crucial to obtain responses that are not only precise but also domain-specific. To that end, we developed WildfireGPT, a prototype LLM agent designed to transform user queries into actionable insights on wildfire risks. We enrich WildfireGPT by providing additional context, such as climate projections and scientific literature, to ensure its information is current, relevant, and scientifically accurate. This enables WildfireGPT to be an effective tool for delivering detailed, user-specific insights on wildfire risks to support a diverse set of end users, including but not limited to researchers and engineers, for making positive impact and decision making.</p></details> | <details><summary>resto...</summary><p>restoring content for arXiv:2402.07877v2 which was replaced in error</p></details> |
| **[SplitReason: Learning To Offload Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16379v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning in large language models (LLMs) tends to produce substantially longer token generation sequences than simpler language modeling tasks. This extended generation length reflects the multi-step, compositional nature of reasoning and is often correlated with higher solution accuracy. From an efficiency perspective, longer token generation exacerbates the inherently sequential and memory-bound decoding phase of LLMs. However, not all parts of this expensive reasoning process are equally difficult to generate. We leverage this observation by offloading only the most challenging parts of the reasoning process to a larger, more capable model, while performing most of the generation with a smaller, more efficient model; furthermore, we teach the smaller model to identify these difficult segments and independently trigger offloading when needed. To enable this behavior, we annotate difficult segments across 18k reasoning traces from the OpenR1-Math-220k chain-of-thought (CoT) dataset. We then apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning fine-tuning (RLFT) to a 1.5B-parameter reasoning model, training it to learn to offload the most challenging parts of its own reasoning process to a larger model. This approach improves AIME24 reasoning accuracy by 24% and 28.3% while offloading 1.35% and 5% of the generated tokens respectively. We open-source our SplitReason model, data, code and logs.</p></details> |  |

While large language models (LLMs) depict remarkable capabilities in automating real-world tasks, their capabilities for healthcare applications such as synthesizing BHCs from clinical notes have not been shown. We introduce a novel pre-processed dataset, the MIMIC-IV-BHC, encapsulating clinical note and brief hospital course (BHC) pairs to adapt LLMs for BHC synthesis. Furthermore, we introduce a benchmark of the summarization performance of two general-purpose LLMs and three healthcare-adapted LLMs. Using clinical notes as input, we apply prompting-based (using in-context learning) and fine-tuning-based adaptation strategies to three open-source LLMs (Clinical-T5-Large, Llama2-13B, FLAN-UL2) and two proprietary LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4). We evaluate these LLMs across multiple context-length inputs using natural language similarity metrics. We further conduct a clinical study with five clinicians, comparing clinician-written and LLM-generated BHCs across 30 samples, focusing on their potential to enhance clinical decision-making through improved summary quality. We observe that the Llama2-13B fine-tuned LLM outperforms other domain-adapted models given quantitative evaluation metrics of BLEU and BERT-Score. GPT-4 with in-context learning shows more robustness to increasing context lengths of clinical note inputs than fine-tuned Llama2-13B. Despite comparable quantitative metrics, the reader study depicts a significant preference for summaries generated by GPT-4 with in-context learning compared to both Llama2-13B fine-tuned summaries and the original summaries, highlighting the need for qualitative clinical evaluation.</p></details> |  |

As this is a novel task, there is currently no relevant dataset available in the community. To address this gap, we first devised a new visualization language called Trajectory Visualization Language (TVL) to facilitate querying trajectory data and generating visualizations. Building on this foundation, we further proposed a dataset construction method that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with human efforts to create high-quality data. Specifically, we first generate TVLs using a comprehensive and systematic process, and then label each TVL with corresponding natural language questions using LLMs. This process results in the creation of the first large-scale Text-to-TrajVis dataset, named TrajVL, which contains 18,140 (question, TVL) pairs. Based on this dataset, we systematically evaluated the performance of multiple LLMs (GPT, Qwen, Llama, etc.) on this task. The experimental results demonstrate that this task is both feasible and highly challenging and merits further exploration within the research community.</p></details> |  |
| **[GOT4Rec: Graph of Thoughts for Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14922v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With their vast open-world knowledge and reasoning abilities, large language models (LLMs) have become a promising tool for sequential recommendation. Researchers have explored various methods to harness these capabilities, but most existing approaches rely on simple input-output prompting, failing to effectively bridge the gap between LLMs' general knowledge and the specific needs of recommendation tasks. While reasoning strategies like chain-of-thought (CoT) have been introduced to enhance performance, they often produce inaccurate recommendations due to underutilized user preference information and insufficient reasoning depth. To address these challenges, we propose GOT4Rec, a novel sequential recommendation method leveraging the graph of thoughts (GoT) reasoning strategy. Our method focuses on three key types of information in user histories: short-term interests, long-term interests and collaborative information from other users. It enables LLMs to reason independently and generate recommendations, subsequently aggregating results to derive final items. This method allows LLMs, with enhanced reasoning capabilities, to better utilize the user sequence information, producing more accurate recommendations and comprehensive explanations. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GOT4Rec, outperforming existing state-of-the-art baselines with an average improvement of 37.11%.

Leading this evolution are proprietary LLMs like GPT-4 and GPT-o1, which have captured widespread attention in the AI community due to their remarkable performance and versatility. Simultaneously, open-source LLMs, such as LLaMA, have made great contributions to the ever-increasing popularity of LLMs due to the ease to customize and deploy the models across diverse applications. Although open-source LLMs present unprecedented opportunities for innovation and research, the commercialization of LLMs has raised concerns about transparency, reproducibility, and safety. Many open-source LLMs fail to meet fundamental transparency requirements by withholding essential components like training code and data, which may hinder further innovations on LLMs. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Moxin 7B, a fully open-source LLM developed, adhering to principles of open science, open source, open data, and open access. We release the pre-training code and configurations, training and fine-tuning datasets, and intermediate and final checkpoints, aiming to make continuous commitments to fully open-source LLMs. After pre-training and obtaining the base model, we finetune the Moxin Base model with SOTA post-training framework and instruction data to obtain Moxin Instruct model. To improve the reasoning capability, we further finetune our Instruct model with chain-of-thought data distilled from DeepSeek R1, and then use Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), an efficient and effective reinforcement learning algorithm following DeepSeek R1, to finetune our model, leading to the Moxin Reasoning model. Experiments show that our models achieve superior performance in various evaluations such as zero-shot evaluation, few-shot evaluation, and CoT evaluation.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we investigate the underlying mechanisms of these attacks by analyzing the attention patterns within LLMs. We introduce the concept of the distraction effect, where specific attention heads, termed important heads, shift focus from the original instruction to the injected instruction. Building on this discovery, we propose Attention Tracker, a training-free detection method that tracks attention patterns on instruction to detect prompt injection attacks without the need for additional LLM inference. Our method generalizes effectively across diverse models, datasets, and attack types, showing an AUROC improvement of up to 10.0% over existing methods, and performs well even on small LLMs. We demonstrate the robustness of our approach through extensive evaluations and provide insights into safeguarding LLM-integrated systems from prompt injection vulnerabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://huggingface.co/spaces/TrustSafeAI/Attention-Tracker</p></details> |

Quantization techniques have mitigated some of these issues by reducing data precision, primarily focusing on General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM). This study introduces a novel sparsity paradigm, transitive sparsity, which leverages the reuse of previously computed results to substantially minimize computational overhead in GEMM operations. By representing transitive relations using a directed acyclic graph, we develop an efficient strategy for determining optimal execution orders, thereby overcoming inherent challenges related to execution dependencies and parallelism. Building on this foundation, we present the Transitive Array, a multiplication-free accelerator designed to exploit transitive sparsity in GEMM. Our architecture effectively balances computational workloads across multiple parallel lanes, ensuring high efficiency and optimal resource utilization. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that the Transitive Array achieves approximately 7.46$\times$ and 3.97$\times$ speedup and 2.31$\times$ and 1.65$\times$ energy reduction compared to state-of-the-art accelerators such as Olive and BitVert while maintaining comparable model accuracy on LLaMA models.</p></details> | ISCA 2025 |

However, a significant gap remains between their current performance and that of expert software engineers. A key differentiator is that human engineers actively seek clarification when faced with ambiguous requirements, while LLMs typically generate code regardless of uncertainties in the problem description. We present ClarifyCoder, a novel framework with synthetic data generation and instruction-tuning that enables LLMs to identify ambiguities and request clarification before proceeding with code generation. While recent work has focused on LLM-based agents for iterative code generation, we argue that the fundamental ability to recognize and query ambiguous requirements should be intrinsic to the models themselves. Our approach consists of two main components: (1) a data synthesis technique that augments existing programming datasets with scenarios requiring clarification to generate clarification-aware training data, and (2) a fine-tuning strategy that teaches models to prioritize seeking clarification over immediate code generation when faced with incomplete or ambiguous requirements. We further provide an empirical analysis of integrating ClarifyCoder with standard fine-tuning for a joint optimization of both clarify-awareness and coding ability. Experimental results demonstrate that ClarifyCoder significantly improves the communication capabilities of Code LLMs through meaningful clarification dialogues while maintaining code generation capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

This paper tackles this challenge by introducing a novel Wikidata-derived natural language inference dataset designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs). Our findings reveal that LLMs perform comparably to random chance on this benchmark, highlighting a gap in relational understanding. To address this, we explore encoder retraining via contrastive learning with k-nearest neighbors. The retrained encoder matches the performance of fine-tuned classification heads while offering additional benefits, including greater efficiency in few-shot learning and improved mitigation of catastrophic forgetting.</p></details> |  |

These models are typically trained on extensive datasets of real-world code reviews that address diverse software development concerns, including testing, refactoring, bug fixes, performance optimization, and maintainability improvements. However, a notable limitation of these datasets is the under representation of code vulnerabilities, critical flaws that pose significant security risks, with security-focused reviews comprising a small fraction of the data. This scarcity of vulnerability-specific data restricts the effectiveness of AI models in identifying and commenting on security-critical code. To address this issue, we propose the creation of a synthetic dataset consisting of vulnerability-focused reviews that specifically comment on security flaws. Our approach leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate human-like code review comments for vulnerabilities, using insights derived from code differences and commit messages. To evaluate the usefulness of the generated synthetic dataset, we plan to use it to fine-tune three existing code review models. We anticipate that the synthetic dataset will improve the performance of the original code review models.</p></details> | <details><summary>MSR 2...</summary><p>MSR 2025 - Registered Reports</p></details> |

However, this increased sophistication introduces significant safety concerns. In this paper, we present the first evaluation and analysis of a novel safety challenge termed Multimodal Situational Safety, which explores how safety considerations vary based on the specific situation in which the user or agent is engaged. We argue that for an MLLM to respond safely, whether through language or action, it often needs to assess the safety implications of a language query within its corresponding visual context. To evaluate this capability, we develop the Multimodal Situational Safety benchmark (MSSBench) to assess the situational safety performance of current MLLMs. The dataset comprises 1,820 language query-image pairs, half of which the image context is safe, and the other half is unsafe. We also develop an evaluation framework that analyzes key safety aspects, including explicit safety reasoning, visual understanding, and, crucially, situational safety reasoning. Our findings reveal that current MLLMs struggle with this nuanced safety problem in the instruction-following setting and struggle to tackle these situational safety challenges all at once, highlighting a key area for future research. Furthermore, we develop multi-agent pipelines to coordinately solve safety challenges, which shows consistent improvement in safety over the original MLLM response.

However, LLMs and fine-tuning are limited to the pre-trained data. For example, ChatGPT's world knowledge until 2021 can be outdated or inaccurate. To enhance the capabilities of LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), is proposed to augment LLMs with additional, new, latest details and information to LLMs. While RAG offers the correct information, it may not best present it, especially to different population groups with personalizations. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) adapts to user needs by aligning model responses with human preference through feedback loops. In real-life applications, such as mental health problems, a dynamic and feedback-based model would continuously adapt to new information and offer personalized assistance due to complex factors fluctuating in a daily environment. Thus, we propose an Online Reinforcement Learning-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (OnRL-RAG) system to detect and personalize the responding systems to mental health problems, such as stress, anxiety, and depression. We use an open-source dataset collected from 2028 College Students with 28 survey questions for each student to demonstrate the performance of our proposed system with the existing systems. Our system achieves superior performance compared to standard RAG and simple LLM via GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-3.5. This work would open up the possibilities of real-life applications of LLMs for personalized services in the everyday environment. The results will also help researchers in the fields of sociology, psychology, and neuroscience to align their theories more closely with the actual human daily environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>It ne...</summary><p>It needs more revisions.

This study constructs a diverse corpus encompassing Chinese scientific terminology, historical translation paradoxes, and literary metaphors. Utilizing a back-translation and Friedman test-based evaluation system (BT-Fried), we evaluate BLEU, CHRF, TER, and semantic similarity metrics across six major LLMs (e.g., GPT-4.5, DeepSeek V3) and three traditional translation tools. Key findings include: (1) Scientific abstracts often benefit from back-translation, while traditional tools outperform LLMs in linguistically distinct texts; (2) LLMs struggle with cultural and literary retention, exemplifying the "paradox of poetic intent"; (3) Some models exhibit "verbatim back-translation", reflecting emergent memory behavior; (4) A novel BLEU variant using Jieba segmentation and n-gram weighting is proposed. The study contributes to the empirical evaluation of Chinese NLP performance and advances understanding of cultural fidelity in AI-mediated translation.</p></details> | 24 pages, 3 figures |

We systematically investigate the capabilities of LLMs in emergency department triage through two key dimensions: (1) robustness to distribution shifts and missing data, and (2) counterfactual analysis of intersectional biases across sex and race. We assess multiple LLM-based approaches, ranging from continued pre-training to in-context learning, as well as machine learning approaches. Our results indicate that LLMs exhibit superior robustness, and we investigate the key factors contributing to the promising LLM-based approaches. Furthermore, in this setting, we identify gaps in LLM preferences that emerge in particular intersections of sex and race. LLMs generally exhibit sex-based differences, but they are most pronounced in certain racial groups. These findings suggest that LLMs encode demographic preferences that may emerge in specific clinical contexts or particular combinations of characteristics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to GenAI4Health Workshop @ AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Learning Explainable Dense Reward Shapes via Bayesian Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16272v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) pipelines for large language model (LLM) alignment typically assign scalar rewards to sequences, using the final token as a surrogate indicator for the quality of the entire sequence. However, this leads to sparse feedback and suboptimal token-level credit assignment. In this work, we frame reward shaping as an optimization problem focused on token-level credit assignment. We propose a reward-shaping function leveraging explainability methods such as SHAP and LIME to estimate per-token rewards from the reward model. To learn parameters of this shaping function, we employ a bilevel optimization framework that integrates Bayesian Optimization and policy training to handle noise from the token reward estimates. Our experiments show that achieving a better balance of token-level reward attribution leads to performance improvements over baselines on downstream tasks and finds an optimal policy faster during training. Furthermore, we show theoretically that explainability methods that are feature additive attribution functions maintain the optimal policy as the original reward.</p></details> |  |

Although recent low-bit quantization methods (e.g., BitNet, DeepSeek) compress weights to as little as 1.58 bits with minimal accuracy loss, edge deployment is still constrained by limited on-chip resources, power budgets, and the often-neglected latency of the prefill phase. We present TeLLMe, the first ternary LLM accelerator for low-power FPGAs (e.g., AMD KV260) that fully supports both prefill and autoregressive decoding using 1.58-bit weights and 8-bit activations. Our contributions include: (1) a table-lookup matrix engine for ternary matmul that merges grouped activations with online precomputation to minimize resource use; (2) a fused, bandwidth-efficient attention module featuring a reversed reordering scheme to accelerate prefill; and (3) a tightly integrated normalization and quantization--dequantization unit optimized for ultra-low-bit inference. Under a 7W power budget, TeLLMe delivers up to 9 tokens/s throughput over 1,024-token contexts and prefill latencies of 0.55--1.15 s for 64--128 token prompts, marking a significant energy-efficiency advance and establishing a new edge FPGA benchmark for generative AI.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce OmniScience, a specialized large reasoning model for general science, developed through three key components: (1) domain adaptive pretraining on a carefully curated corpus of scientific literature, (2) instruction tuning on a specialized dataset to guide the model in following domain-specific tasks, and (3) reasoning-based knowledge distillation through fine-tuning to significantly enhance its ability to generate contextually relevant and logically sound responses. We demonstrate the versatility of OmniScience by developing a battery agent that efficiently ranks molecules as potential electrolyte solvents or additives. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that OmniScience is competitive with state-of-the-art large reasoning models on the GPQA Diamond and domain-specific battery benchmarks, while outperforming all public reasoning and non-reasoning models with similar parameter counts. We further demonstrate via ablation experiments that domain adaptive pretraining and reasoning-based knowledge distillation are critical to attain our performance levels, across benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Despite the high cost of training, large language models (LLMs) -- the backbone of most modern question-answering systems -- still struggle to reliably capture the nuanced relationships between concepts that are crucial for reasoning in specialized fields like medicine. In this work, we present MEG, a parameter-efficient approach for medical knowledge-augmented LLMs. MEG uses a lightweight mapping network to incorporate knowledge graph embeddings into the LLM, enabling it to leverage external knowledge in a cost-effective way. We evaluate our method on four popular medical multiple-choice datasets and show that LLMs i) can effectively interpret knowledge graph embeddings and ii) gain significant advantages from the factual grounding these embeddings provide. MEG attains an average of +6.7% and +9.9% accuracy over specialized models like BioMistral-7B and MediTron-7B, respectively. Finally, we show that MEG's performance remains robust to the choice of graph encoder.</p></details> |  |

This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the publication trend of LLM-related papers in 77 top-tier computer science conferences over the past six years (2019-2024). We approach this analysis from four distinct perspectives: (1) We investigate how LLM research is driving topic shifts within major conferences. (2) We adopt a topic modeling approach to identify various areas of LLM-related topic growth and reveal the topics of concern at different conferences. (3) We explore distinct contribution patterns of academic and industrial institutions. (4) We study the influence of national origins on LLM development trajectories. Synthesizing the findings from these diverse analytical angles, we derive ten key insights that illuminate the dynamics and evolution of the LLM research ecosystem.</p></details> |  |

However, fairness and reliability concerns persist, as hallucinations can emerge at both the retrieval and generation stages, affecting users' reasoning and decision-making. Our research explores how tailored warning messages -- whose content depends on the specific context of hallucination -- shape user reasoning and actions in an educational quiz setting. Preliminary findings suggest that while warnings improve accuracy and awareness of high-level hallucinations, they may also introduce cognitive friction, leading to confusion and diminished trust in the system. By examining these interactions, this work contributes to the broader goal of AI-augmented reasoning: developing systems that actively support human reflection, critical thinking, and informed decision-making rather than passive information consumption.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 2025 ACM Workshop on Human-AI Interaction for Augmented Reasoning</p></details> |

However, IFC data can be very complicated because it allows for multiple ways to represent the same product information. In this research, we utilise the capabilities of LLMs to parse the IFC data with Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph-RAG) technique to retrieve building object properties and their relations. We will show that, despite limitations due to the complex hierarchy of the IFC data, the Graph-RAG parsing enhances generative LLMs like GPT-4o with graph-based knowledge, enabling natural language query-response retrieval without the need for a complex pipeline.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 European Conference on Computing in Construction</p></details> |
| **[Credible plan-driven RAG method for Multi-hop Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16787v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-hop question answering (QA) presents a considerable challenge for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), requiring the structured decomposition of complex queries into logical reasoning paths and the generation of dependable intermediate results. However, deviations in reasoning paths or errors in intermediate results, which are common in current RAG methods, may propagate and accumulate throughout the reasoning process, diminishing the accuracy of the answer to complex queries. To address this challenge, we propose the Plan-then-Act-and-Review (PAR RAG) framework, which is organized into three key stages: planning, act, and review, and aims to offer an interpretable and incremental reasoning paradigm for accurate and reliable multi-hop question answering by mitigating error propagation.PAR RAG initially applies a top-down problem decomposition strategy, formulating a comprehensive plan that integrates multiple executable steps from a holistic viewpoint. This approach avoids the pitfalls of local optima common in traditional RAG methods, ensuring the accuracy of the entire reasoning path. Subsequently, PAR RAG incorporates a plan execution mechanism based on multi-granularity verification. By utilizing both coarse-grained similarity information and fine-grained relevant data, the framework thoroughly checks and adjusts intermediate results, ensuring process accuracy while effectively managing error propagation and amplification. Experimental results on multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that the PAR RAG framework substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in key metrics, including EM and F1 scores.</p></details> | 18 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Exploring the Role of Knowledge Graph-Based RAG in Japanese Medical Question Answering with Small-Scale LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10982v4)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) perform well in medical QA, but their effectiveness in Japanese contexts is limited due to privacy constraints that prevent the use of commercial models like GPT-4 in clinical settings. As a result, recent efforts focus on instruction-tuning open-source LLMs, though the potential of combining them with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we are the first to explore a knowledge graph-based (KG) RAG framework for Japanese medical QA small-scale open-source LLMs. Experimental results show that KG-based RAG has only a limited impact on Japanese medical QA using small-scale open-source LLMs. Further case studies reveal that the effectiveness of the RAG is sensitive to the quality and relevance of the external retrieved content. These findings offer valuable insights into the challenges and potential of applying RAG in Japanese medical QA, while also serving as a reference for other low-resource languages.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Existing methods, which operate at the document level, fail to effectively filter out such content. We propose LLM-driven chunk filtering, ChunkRAG, a framework that enhances RAG systems by evaluating and filtering retrieved information at the chunk level. Our approach employs semantic chunking to divide documents into coherent sections and utilizes LLM-based relevance scoring to assess each chunk's alignment with the user's query. By filtering out less pertinent chunks before the generation phase, we significantly reduce hallucinations and improve factual accuracy. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing RAG models, achieving higher accuracy on tasks requiring precise information retrieval. This advancement enhances the reliability of RAG systems, making them particularly beneficial for applications like fact-checking and multi-hop reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, Student Research Workshop 2025 (NAACL SRW 2025)</p></details> |

By synergizing retrieval mechanisms with advanced reasoning, LLMs can now tackle increasingly complex problems. This paper presents a systematic review of the collaborative interplay between RAG and reasoning, clearly defining "reasoning" within the RAG context. It construct a comprehensive taxonomy encompassing multi-dimensional collaborative objectives, representative paradigms, and technical implementations, and analyze the bidirectional synergy methods. Additionally, we critically evaluate current limitations in RAG assessment, including the absence of intermediate supervision for multi-step reasoning and practical challenges related to cost-risk trade-offs. To bridge theory and practice, we provide practical guidelines tailored to diverse real-world applications. Finally, we identify promising research directions, such as graph-based knowledge integration, hybrid model collaboration, and RL-driven optimization. Overall, this work presents a theoretical framework and practical foundation to advance RAG systems in academia and industry, fostering the next generation of RAG solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Viability of Crowdsourcing for RAG Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15689v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How good are humans at writing and judging responses in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) scenarios? To answer this question, we investigate the efficacy of crowdsourcing for RAG through two complementary studies: response writing and response utility judgment. We present the Crowd RAG Corpus 2025 (CrowdRAG-25), which consists of 903 human-written and 903 LLM-generated responses for the 301 topics of the TREC RAG'24 track, across the three discourse styles 'bulleted list', 'essay', and 'news'. For a selection of 65 topics, the corpus further contains 47,320 pairwise human judgments and 10,556 pairwise LLM judgments across seven utility dimensions (e.g., coverage and coherence). Our analyses give insights into human writing behavior for RAG and the viability of crowdsourcing for RAG evaluation. Human pairwise judgments provide reliable and cost-effective results compared to LLM-based pairwise or human/LLM-based pointwise judgments, as well as automated comparisons with human-written reference responses. All our data and tools are freely available.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 tables, 5 figures. Accepted at SIGIR'25</p></details> |
| **[CiteFix: Enhancing RAG Accuracy Through Post-Processing Citation Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15629v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful application of Large Language Models (LLMs), revolutionizing information search and consumption. RAG systems combine traditional search capabilities with LLMs to generate comprehensive answers to user queries, ideally with accurate citations. However, in our experience of developing a RAG product, LLMs often struggle with source attribution, aligning with other industry studies reporting citation accuracy rates of only about 74% for popular generative search engines. To address this, we present efficient post-processing algorithms to improve citation accuracy in LLM-generated responses, with minimal impact on latency and cost. Our approaches cross-check generated citations against retrieved articles using methods including keyword + semantic matching, fine tuned model with BERTScore, and a lightweight LLM-based technique. Our experimental results demonstrate a relative improvement of 15.46% in the overall accuracy metrics of our RAG system. This significant enhancement potentially enables a shift from our current larger language model to a relatively smaller model that is approximately 12x more cost-effective and 3x faster in inference time, while maintaining comparable performance. This research contributes to enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of AI-generated content in information retrieval and summarization tasks which is critical to gain customer trust especially in commercial products.</p></details> |  |
| **[Support Evaluation for the TREC 2024 RAG Track: Comparing Human versus LLM Judges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15205v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to generate answers with citations from source documents containing "ground truth", thereby reducing system hallucinations. A crucial factor in RAG evaluation is "support", whether the information in the cited documents supports the answer. To this end, we conducted a large-scale comparative study of 45 participant submissions on 36 topics to the TREC 2024 RAG Track, comparing an automatic LLM judge (GPT-4o) against human judges for support assessment. We considered two conditions: (1) fully manual assessments from scratch and (2) manual assessments with post-editing of LLM predictions. Our results indicate that for 56% of the manual from-scratch assessments, human and GPT-4o predictions match perfectly (on a three-level scale), increasing to 72% in the manual with post-editing condition. Furthermore, by carefully analyzing the disagreements in an unbiased study, we found that an independent human judge correlates better with GPT-4o than a human judge, suggesting that LLM judges can be a reliable alternative for support assessment. To conclude, we provide a qualitative analysis of human and GPT-4o errors to help guide future iterations of support assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGIR 2025 (short)</p></details> |
| **[The Great Nugget Recall: Automating Fact Extraction and RAG Evaluation with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15068v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced the capabilities of information access systems, especially with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Nevertheless, the evaluation of RAG systems remains a barrier to continued progress, a challenge we tackle in this work by proposing an automatic evaluation framework that is validated against human annotations. We believe that the nugget evaluation methodology provides a solid foundation for evaluating RAG systems. This approach, originally developed for the TREC Question Answering (QA) Track in 2003, evaluates systems based on atomic facts that should be present in good answers. Our efforts focus on "refactoring" this methodology, where we describe the AutoNuggetizer framework that specifically applies LLMs to both automatically create nuggets and automatically assign nuggets to system answers. In the context of the TREC 2024 RAG Track, we calibrate a fully automatic approach against strategies where nuggets are created manually or semi-manually by human assessors and then assigned manually to system answers. Based on results from a community-wide evaluation, we observe strong agreement at the run level between scores derived from fully automatic nugget evaluation and human-based variants. The agreement is stronger when individual framework components such as nugget assignment are automated independently. This suggests that our evaluation framework provides tradeoffs between effort and quality that can be used to guide the development of future RAG systems. However, further research is necessary to refine our approach, particularly in establishing robust per-topic agreement to diagnose system failures effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in SIGIR 2025.

| **[AlignRAG: An Adaptable Framework for Resolving Misalignments in Retrieval-Aware Reasoning of RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14858v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a foundational paradigm for knowledge-grounded text generation. However, existing RAG pipelines often fail to ensure that the reasoning trajectories align with the evidential constraints imposed by retrieved content. In this paper, we reframe RAG as a problem of retrieval-aware reasoning and identify a core challenge: reasoning misalignment-the mismatch between a model's reasoning trajectory and the retrieved evidence. To address this challenge, we propose AlignRAG, a novel test-time framework that mitigates reasoning misalignment through iterative Critique-Driven Alignment (CDA) steps. In contrast to prior approaches that rely on static training or post-hoc selection, AlignRAG actively refines reasoning trajectories during inference by enforcing fine-grained alignment with evidence. Our framework introduces a new paradigm for retrieval-aware reasoning by: (1) constructing context-rich training corpora; (2) generating contrastive critiques from preference-aware reasoning trajectories; (3) training a dedicated \textit{Critic Language Model (CLM)} to identify reasoning misalignments; and (4) applying CDA steps to optimize reasoning trajectories iteratively. Empirical results demonstrate that AlignRAG consistently outperforms all baselines and could integrate as a plug-and-play module into existing RAG pipelines without further changes. By reconceptualizing RAG as a structured reasoning trajectory and establishing the test-time framework for correcting reasoning misalignments in RAG, AlignRAG provides practical advancements for retrieval-aware generation.</p></details> |  |

Within financial sectors, modern enterprises increasingly rely on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to address complex compliance requirements in financial document workflows. However, existing solutions struggle to account for the inherent heterogeneity of data (e.g., text, tables, diagrams) and evolving nature of regulatory standards used in financial filings, leading to compromised accuracy in critical information extraction. We propose the FinSage framework as a solution, utilizing a multi-aspect RAG framework tailored for regulatory compliance analysis in multi-modal financial documents. FinSage introduces three innovative components: (1) a multi-modal pre-processing pipeline that unifies diverse data formats and generates chunk-level metadata summaries, (2) a multi-path sparse-dense retrieval system augmented with query expansion (HyDE) and metadata-aware semantic search, and (3) a domain-specialized re-ranking module fine-tuned via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to prioritize compliance-critical content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FinSage achieves an impressive recall of 92.51% on 75 expert-curated questions derived from surpasses the best baseline method on the FinanceBench question answering datasets by 24.06% in accuracy. Moreover, FinSage has been successfully deployed as financial question-answering agent in online meetings, where it has already served more than 1,200 people.</p></details> |  |

This system enables efficient searching for specific government legal notices, making legal information more accessible.

Unlike traditional vulnerabilities, these packages are intentionally designed to deceive users, making detection challenging due to evolving attack methods and the lack of structured datasets. In this work, we empirically evaluate the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and few-shot learning for detecting malicious source code. We fine-tune LLMs on curated datasets and integrate YARA rules, GitHub Security Advisories, and malicious code snippets with the aim of enhancing classification accuracy. We came across a counterintuitive outcome: While RAG is expected to boost up the prediction performance, it fails in the performed evaluation, obtaining a mediocre accuracy. In contrast, few-shot learning is more effective as it significantly improves the detection of malicious code, achieving 97% accuracy and 95% balanced accuracy, outperforming traditional RAG approaches. Thus, future work should expand structured knowledge bases, refine retrieval models, and explore hybrid AI-driven cybersecurity solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been peer-reviewed and accepted for publication to the 29th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE 2025)</p></details> |

Given a user query, RAG pipelines typically first retrieve (R) relevant information from external sources, before invoking a Large Language Model (LLM), augmented (A) with this information, to generate (G) responses. Modern RAG pipelines frequently chain multiple retrieval and generation components, in any order. However, developing effective RAG pipelines is challenging because retrieval and generation components are intertwined, making it hard to identify which component(s) cause errors in the eventual output. The parameters with the greatest impact on output quality often require hours of pre-processing after each change, creating prohibitively slow feedback cycles. To address these challenges, we present RAGGY, a developer tool that combines a Python library of composable RAG primitives with an interactive interface for real-time debugging. We contribute the design and implementation of RAGGY, insights into expert debugging patterns through a qualitative study with 12 engineers, and design implications for future RAG tools that better align with developers' natural workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

When relevant internal documents are unavailable, the system struggles to generate accurate and complete responses. Additionally, using closed-source Large Language Models (LLMs) raises concerns about exposing proprietary information. To address these issues, we propose the Secure Multifaceted-RAG (SecMulti-RAG) framework, which retrieves not only from internal documents but also from two supplementary sources: pre-generated expert knowledge for anticipated queries and on-demand external LLM-generated knowledge. To mitigate security risks, we adopt a local open-source generator and selectively utilize external LLMs only when prompts are deemed safe by a filtering mechanism. This approach enhances completeness, prevents data leakage, and reduces costs. In our evaluation on a report generation task in the automotive industry, SecMulti-RAG significantly outperforms traditional RAG - achieving 79.3 to 91.9 percent win rates across correctness, richness, and helpfulness in LLM-based evaluation, and 56.3 to 70.4 percent in human evaluation. This highlights SecMulti-RAG as a practical and secure solution for enterprise RAG.</p></details> |  |

However, deploying RAG on consumer-grade platforms is challenging due to limited memory and the increasing scale of both models and knowledge bases. In this work, we introduce RAGDoll, a resource-efficient, self-adaptive RAG serving system integrated with LLMs, specifically designed for resource-constrained platforms. RAGDoll exploits the insight that RAG retrieval and LLM generation impose different computational and memory demands, which in a traditional serial workflow result in substantial idle times and poor resource utilization. Based on this insight, RAGDoll decouples retrieval and generation into parallel pipelines, incorporating joint memory placement and dynamic batch scheduling strategies to optimize resource usage across diverse hardware devices and workloads. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAGDoll adapts effectively to various hardware configurations and LLM scales, achieving up to 3.6 times speedup in average latency compared to serial RAG systems based on vLLM.</p></details> |  |

This advancement has enabled their widespread deployment across sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and enterprise applications. RAG mitigates hallucinations by integrating external knowledge, yet introduces privacy risk and security risk, notably data breaching risk and data poisoning risk. While recent studies have explored prompt injection and poisoning attacks, there remains a significant gap in comprehensive research on controlling inbound and outbound query flows to mitigate these threats. In this paper, we propose an AI firewall, ControlNET, designed to safeguard RAG-based LLM systems from these vulnerabilities. ControlNET controls query flows by leveraging activation shift phenomena to detect adversarial queries and mitigate their impact through semantic divergence. We conduct comprehensive experiments on four different benchmark datasets including Msmarco, HotpotQA, FinQA, and MedicalSys using state-of-the-art open source LLMs (Llama3, Vicuna, and Mistral). Our results demonstrate that ControlNET achieves over 0.909 AUROC in detecting and mitigating security threats while preserving system harmlessness. Overall, ControlNET offers an effective, robust, harmless defense mechanism, marking a significant advancement toward the secure deployment of RAG-based LLM systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://ai.zjuicsr.cn/firewall</p></details> |

However, they also exhibit inherent limitations, such as outdated knowledge and susceptibility to hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm to address these issues, but it also introduces new vulnerabilities. Recent efforts have focused on the security of RAG-based LLMs, yet existing attack methods face three critical challenges: (1) their effectiveness declines sharply when only a limited number of poisoned texts can be injected into the knowledge database, (2) they lack sufficient stealth, as the attacks are often detectable by anomaly detection systems, which compromises their effectiveness, and (3) they rely on heuristic approaches to generate poisoned texts, lacking formal optimization frameworks and theoretic guarantees, which limits their effectiveness and applicability. To address these issues, we propose coordinated Prompt-RAG attack (PR-attack), a novel optimization-driven attack that introduces a small number of poisoned texts into the knowledge database while embedding a backdoor trigger within the prompt. When activated, the trigger causes the LLM to generate pre-designed responses to targeted queries, while maintaining normal behavior in other contexts. This ensures both high effectiveness and stealth. We formulate the attack generation process as a bilevel optimization problem leveraging a principled optimization framework to develop optimal poisoned texts and triggers. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PR-Attack, achieving a high attack success rate even with a limited number of poisoned texts and significantly improved stealth compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGIR 2025</p></details> |
| **[ARCeR: an Agentic RAG for the Automated Definition of Cyber Ranges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12143v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing and evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats necessitates the development of supporting tools and platforms that allow for the creation of realistic IT environments operating within virtual, controlled settings as Cyber Ranges (CRs). CRs can be exploited for analyzing vulnerabilities and experimenting with the effectiveness of devised countermeasures, as well as serving as training environments for building cyber security skills and abilities for IT operators. This paper proposes ARCeR as an innovative solution for the automatic generation and deployment of CRs, starting from user-provided descriptions in a natural language. ARCeR relies on the Agentic RAG paradigm, which allows it to fully exploit state-of-art AI technologies. Experimental results show that ARCeR is able to successfully process prompts even in cases that LLMs or basic RAG systems are not able to cope with. Furthermore, ARCeR is able to target any CR framework provided that specific knowledge is made available to it.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Visual RAG Pipeline for Few-Shot Fine-Grained Product Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11838v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the rapid evolution of learning and computer vision algorithms, Fine-Grained Classification (FGC) still poses an open problem in many practically relevant applications. In the retail domain, for example, the identification of fast changing and visually highly similar products and their properties are key to automated price-monitoring and product recommendation. This paper presents a novel Visual RAG pipeline that combines the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach and Vision Language Models (VLMs) for few-shot FGC. This Visual RAG pipeline extracts product and promotion data in advertisement leaflets from various retailers and simultaneously predicts fine-grained product ids along with price and discount information. Compared to previous approaches, the key characteristic of the Visual RAG pipeline is that it allows the prediction of novel products without re-training, simply by adding a few class samples to the RAG database. Comparing several VLM back-ends like GPT-4o [23], GPT-4o-mini [24], and Gemini 2.0 Flash [10], our approach achieves 86.8% accuracy on a diverse dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Shared Disk KV Cache Management for Efficient Multi-Instance Inference in RAG-Powered LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11765v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent large language models (LLMs) face increasing inference latency as input context length and model size continue to grow. In particular, the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique, which enhances LLM responses by incorporating external knowledge, exacerbates this issue by significantly increasing the number of input tokens. This expansion in token length leads to a substantial rise in computational overhead, particularly during the prefill stage, resulting in prolonged time-to-first-token (TTFT). To address this issue, this paper proposes a method to reduce TTFT by leveraging a disk-based key-value (KV) cache to lessen the computational burden during the prefill stage. We also introduce a disk-based shared KV cache management system, called Shared RAG-DCache, for multi-instance LLM RAG service environments. This system, together with an optimal system configuration, improves both throughput and latency under given resource constraints. Shared RAG-DCache exploits the locality of documents related to user queries in RAG, as well as the queueing delay in LLM inference services. It proactively generates and stores disk KV caches for query-related documents and shares them across multiple LLM instances to enhance inference performance. In experiments on a single host equipped with 2 GPUs and 1 CPU, Shared RAG-DCache achieved a 15~71% increase in throughput and up to a 12~65% reduction in latency, depending on the resource configuration.</p></details> |  |
| **[NodeRAG: Structuring Graph-based RAG with Heterogeneous Nodes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11544v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) empowers large language models to access external and private corpus, enabling factually consistent responses in specific domains. By exploiting the inherent structure of the corpus, graph-based RAG methods further enrich this process by building a knowledge graph index and leveraging the structural nature of graphs. However, current graph-based RAG approaches seldom prioritize the design of graph structures. Inadequately designed graph not only impede the seamless integration of diverse graph algorithms but also result in workflow inconsistencies and degraded performance. To further unleash the potential of graph for RAG, we propose NodeRAG, a graph-centric framework introducing heterogeneous graph structures that enable the seamless and holistic integration of graph-based methodologies into the RAG workflow. By aligning closely with the capabilities of LLMs, this framework ensures a fully cohesive and efficient end-to-end process. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that NodeRAG exhibits performance advantages over previous methods, including GraphRAG and LightRAG, not only in indexing time, query time, and storage efficiency but also in delivering superior question-answering performance on multi-hop benchmarks and open-ended head-to-head evaluations with minimal retrieval tokens.

| **[Towards Automated Safety Requirements Derivation Using Agent-based RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11243v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the automated derivation of safety requirements in a self-driving vehicle use case, leveraging LLMs in combination with agent-based retrieval-augmented generation. Conventional approaches that utilise pre-trained LLMs to assist in safety analyses typically lack domain-specific knowledge. Existing RAG approaches address this issue, yet their performance deteriorates when handling complex queries and it becomes increasingly harder to retrieve the most relevant information. This is particularly relevant for safety-relevant applications. In this paper, we propose the use of agent-based RAG to derive safety requirements and show that the retrieved information is more relevant to the queries. We implement an agent-based approach on a document pool of automotive standards and the Apollo case study, as a representative example of an automated driving perception system. Our solution is tested on a data set of safety requirement questions and answers, extracted from the Apollo data. Evaluating a set of selected RAG metrics, we present and discuss advantages of a agent-based approach compared to default RAG methods.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |
| **[SlowFastVAD: Video Anomaly Detection via Integrating Simple Detector and RAG-Enhanced Vision-Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10320v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) aims to identify unexpected events in videos and has wide applications in safety-critical domains. While semi-supervised methods trained on only normal samples have gained traction, they often suffer from high false alarm rates and poor interpretability. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong multimodal reasoning capabilities, offering new opportunities for explainable anomaly detection. However, their high computational cost and lack of domain adaptation hinder real-time deployment and reliability. Inspired by dual complementary pathways in human visual perception, we propose SlowFastVAD, a hybrid framework that integrates a fast anomaly detector with a slow anomaly detector (namely a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) enhanced VLM), to address these limitations. Specifically, the fast detector first provides coarse anomaly confidence scores, and only a small subset of ambiguous segments, rather than the entire video, is further analyzed by the slower yet more interpretable VLM for elaborate detection and reasoning. Furthermore, to adapt VLMs to domain-specific VAD scenarios, we construct a knowledge base including normal patterns based on few normal samples and abnormal patterns inferred by VLMs. During inference, relevant patterns are retrieved and used to augment prompts for anomaly reasoning. Finally, we smoothly fuse the anomaly confidence of fast and slow detectors to enhance robustness of anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that SlowFastVAD effectively combines the strengths of both fast and slow detectors, and achieves remarkable detection accuracy and interpretability with significantly reduced computational overhead, making it well-suited for real-world VAD applications with high reliability requirements.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Personalization: From RAG to Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10147v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalization has become an essential capability in modern AI systems, enabling customized interactions that align with individual user preferences, contexts, and goals. Recent research has increasingly concentrated on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks and their evolution into more advanced agent-based architectures within personalized settings to enhance user satisfaction. Building on this foundation, this survey systematically examines personalization across the three core stages of RAG: pre-retrieval, retrieval, and generation. Beyond RAG, we further extend its capabilities into the realm of Personalized LLM-based Agents, which enhance traditional RAG systems with agentic functionalities, including user understanding, personalized planning and execution, and dynamic generation. For both personalization in RAG and agent-based personalization, we provide formal definitions, conduct a comprehensive review of recent literature, and summarize key datasets and evaluation metrics. Additionally, we discuss fundamental challenges, limitations, and promising research directions in this evolving field.

| **[RAG-Based Fuzzing of Cross-Architecture Compilers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08967v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>OneAPI is an open standard that supports cross-architecture software development with minimal effort from developers. It brings DPC++ and C++ compilers which need to be thoroughly tested to verify their correctness, reliability, and security. Compilers have numerous code flows and optimization features. This process requires developers with deep understanding of the different compiler flows to craft testcases specific to target paths in the compiler. This testcase creation is a time-consuming and costly process. In this paper, we propose a large-language model (LLM)-based compiler fuzzing tool that integrates the concept of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). This tool automates the testcase generation task and relieves experienced compiler developers from investing time to craft testcase generation patterns. We test our proposed approach on the Intel DPC++/C++ compiler. This compiler compiles SYCL code and allows developers to offload it to different architectures, e.g. GPUs and CPUs from different vendors. Using this tool, we managed to identify 87 SYCL code test cases that lead to output value mismatch or compiler runtime errors when compiled using Intel DPC++ and clang++ compilers and run on different architectures. The testcases and the identified unexpected behaviors of the compilers under test were obtained within only few hours with no prior background on the compiler passes under tests. This tool facilitates efficient compiler fuzzing with reduced developer time requirements via the dynamic testcase creation capability provided by an LLM with RAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Adaptive Vector Index Partitioning Scheme for Low-Latency RAG Pipeline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08930v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance response quality by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with vector databases, enabling external knowledge retrieval to support language model reasoning. While RAG enables efficient question answering with smaller LLMs, existing optimizations for vector search and LLM serving have largely been developed in isolation. As a result, their integration often leads to suboptimal end-to-end performance. ... This paper introduces VectorLiteRAG, an optimized vector index partitioning mechanism designed for RAG systems that enhances the responsiveness of the system by jointly optimizing vector search and LLM serving across CPU and GPU system. A key challenge is to determine which indices and how much of the vector index should reside on the GPU and adjusting LLM batch sizes to balance the pipeline for lower Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and meeting user-defined Service-Level Objectives (SLOs). To address this, we leverage the insight that cluster access in vector databases exhibits access skew, where a subset of clusters are queried significantly more frequently than others. VectorLiteRAG exploits this property through an optimized memory distribution strategy, dynamically allocating the minimum number of vector indices corresponding to frequently accessed clusters onto the GPU HBM to ensure a balanced pipeline with the LLM for high responsiveness. This adaptive partitioning scheme is guided by a statistical model that informs memory allocation and workload distribution. Our evaluation demonstrates that VectorLiteRAG improves vector search responsiveness by 2x, significantly reduces end-to-end TTFT in RAG systems by intelligently balancing memory resources between vector search and LLM execution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Out of Style: RAG's Fragility to Linguistic Variation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08231v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the impressive performance of Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) systems across various NLP benchmarks, their robustness in handling real-world user-LLM interaction queries remains largely underexplored. This presents a critical gap for practical deployment, where user queries exhibit greater linguistic variations and can trigger cascading errors across interdependent RAG components. In this work, we systematically analyze how varying four linguistic dimensions (formality, readability, politeness, and grammatical correctness) impact RAG performance. We evaluate two retrieval models and nine LLMs, ranging from 3 to 72 billion parameters, across four information-seeking Question Answering (QA) datasets. Our results reveal that linguistic reformulations significantly impact both retrieval and generation stages, leading to a relative performance drop of up to 40.41% in Recall@5 scores for less formal queries and 38.86% in answer match scores for queries containing grammatical errors. Notably, RAG systems exhibit greater sensitivity to such variations compared to LLM-only generations, highlighting their vulnerability to error propagation due to linguistic shifts. These findings highlight the need for improved robustness techniques to enhance reliability in diverse user interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A System for Comprehensive Assessment of RAG Frameworks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07803v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a standard paradigm for enhancing the factual accuracy and contextual relevance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating retrieval mechanisms. However, existing evaluation frameworks fail to provide a holistic black-box approach to assessing RAG systems, especially in real-world deployment scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce SCARF (System for Comprehensive Assessment of RAG Frameworks), a modular and flexible evaluation framework designed to benchmark deployed RAG applications systematically. SCARF provides an end-to-end, black-box evaluation methodology, enabling a limited-effort comparison across diverse RAG frameworks. Our framework supports multiple deployment configurations and facilitates automated testing across vector databases and LLM serving strategies, producing a detailed performance report. Moreover, SCARF integrates practical considerations such as response coherence, providing a scalable and adaptable solution for researchers and industry professionals evaluating RAG applications. Using the REST APIs interface, we demonstrate how SCARF can be applied to real-world scenarios, showcasing its flexibility in assessing different RAG frameworks and configurations.

Given the overwhelming volume and inherent complexity of scientific collections, conventional search systems often lack necessary intuitiveness and interactivity, presenting substantial barriers for learners, educators, and researchers. CollEx addresses these limitations by employing state-of-the-art Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) as multimodal agents accessible through an intuitive chat interface. By abstracting complex interactions via specialized agents equipped with advanced tools, CollEx facilitates curiosity-driven exploration, significantly simplifying access to diverse scientific collections and records therein. Our system integrates textual and visual modalities, supporting educational scenarios that are helpful for teachers, pupils, students, and researchers by fostering independent exploration as well as scientific excitement and curiosity. Furthermore, CollEx serves the research community by discovering interdisciplinary connections and complementing visual data. We illustrate the effectiveness of our system through a proof-of-concept application containing over 64,000 unique records across 32 collections from a local scientific collection from a public university.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging LLMs for Utility-Focused Annotation: Reducing Manual Effort for Retrieval and RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05220v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval models typically rely on costly human-labeled query-document relevance annotations for training and evaluation. To reduce this cost and leverage the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in relevance judgments, we aim to explore whether LLM-generated annotations can effectively replace human annotations in training retrieval models. Retrieval usually emphasizes relevance, which indicates "topic-relatedness" of a document to a query, while in RAG, the value of a document (or utility) depends on how it contributes to answer generation. Recognizing this mismatch, some researchers use LLM performance on downstream tasks with documents as labels, but this approach requires manual answers for specific tasks, leading to high costs and limited generalization. In another line of work, prompting LLMs to select useful documents as RAG references eliminates the need for human annotation and is not task-specific. If we leverage LLMs' utility judgments to annotate retrieval data, we may retain cross-task generalization without human annotation in large-scale corpora. Therefore, we investigate utility-focused annotation via LLMs for large-scale retriever training data across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings on the retrieval and RAG tasks. To reduce the impact of low-quality positives labeled by LLMs, we design a novel loss function, i.e., Disj-InfoNCE. Our experiments reveal that: (1) Retrievers trained on utility-focused annotations significantly outperform those trained on human annotations in the out-of-domain setting on both tasks, demonstrating superior generalization capabilities. (2) LLM annotation does not replace human annotation in the in-domain setting. However, incorporating just 20% human-annotated data enables retrievers trained with utility-focused annotations to match the performance of models trained entirely with human annotations.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Diversity Enhances an LLM's Performance in RAG and Long-context Task](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09017v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the challenge of context window limitations, primarily due to the quadratic time complexity of the self-attention mechanism (\(O(N^2)\), where \(N\) denotes the context window length). This constraint impacts tasks such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in question answering (Q\&A) and long context summarization. A common approach involves selecting content with the highest similarity to the query; however, this often leads to redundancy and the exclusion of diverse yet relevant information. Building on principles from Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) and Farthest Point Sampling (FPS), we integrate diversity into the content selection process. Our findings reveal that incorporating diversity substantially increases the recall of selecting relevant sentences or chunks before LLM-based Q\&A and summarization. These results highlight the importance of maintaining diversity in future LLM applications to further improve summarization and Q\&A outcomes.</p></details> |  |

While hierarchical planning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) address some of these challenges, they remain insufficient on their own and a deeper integration is required for achieving more reliable systems. To this end, we propose a neuro-symbolic approach that enhances LLMs-based planners with Knowledge Graph-based RAG for hierarchical plan generation. This method decomposes complex tasks into manageable subtasks, further expanded into executable atomic action sequences. To ensure formal correctness and proper decomposition, we integrate a Symbolic Validator, which also functions as a failure detector by aligning expected and observed world states. Our evaluation against baseline methods demonstrates the consistent significant advantages of integrating hierarchical planning, symbolic verification, and RAG across tasks of varying complexity and different LLMs. Additionally, our experimental setup and novel metrics not only validate our approach for complex planning but also serve as a tool for assessing LLMs' reasoning and compositional capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Accurate and efficient scenario data search is critical for both online vehicle decision-making and planning, and offline scenario generation and simulations, as it allows for leveraging the scenario experiences to improve the overall performance. Especially with the application of large language models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) systems in autonomous driving, urgent requirements are put forward. In this paper, we introduce the Driving-RAG framework to address the challenges of efficient scenario data embedding, search, and applications for RAG systems. Our embedding model aligns fundamental scenario information and scenario distance metrics in the vector space. The typical scenario sampling method combined with hierarchical navigable small world can perform efficient scenario vector search to achieve high efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. In addition, the reorganization mechanism by graph knowledge enhances the relevance to the prompt scenarios and augment LLM generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on typical trajectory planning task for complex interactive scenarios such as ramps and intersections, showcasing its advantages for RAG applications.</p></details> |  |

Producing such semantic co-speech gestures has been a major challenge for the existing neural systems that can generate rhythmic beat gestures, but struggle to produce semantically meaningful gestures. Therefore, we present RAG-Gesture, a diffusion-based gesture generation approach that leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce natural-looking and semantically rich gestures. Our neuro-explicit gesture generation approach is designed to produce semantic gestures grounded in interpretable linguistic knowledge. We achieve this by using explicit domain knowledge to retrieve exemplar motions from a database of co-speech gestures. Once retrieved, we then inject these semantic exemplar gestures into our diffusion-based gesture generation pipeline using DDIM inversion and retrieval guidance at the inference time without any need of training. Further, we propose a control paradigm for guidance, that allows the users to modulate the amount of influence each retrieval insertion has over the generated sequence. Our comparative evaluations demonstrate the validity of our approach against recent gesture generation approaches.

| **[CacheBlend: Fast Large Language Model Serving for RAG with Cached Knowledge Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16444v3)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often incorporate multiple text chunks in their inputs to provide the necessary contexts. To speed up the prefill of the long LLM inputs, one can pre-compute the KV cache of a text and re-use the KV cache when the context is reused as the prefix of another LLM input. However, the reused text chunks are not always the input prefix, which makes precomputed KV caches not directly usable since they ignore the text's cross-attention with the preceding texts. Thus, the benefits of reusing KV caches remain largely unrealized. This paper tackles just one challenge: when an LLM input contains multiple text chunks, how to quickly combine their precomputed KV caches in order to achieve the same generation quality as the expensive full prefill (i.e., without reusing KV cache)? This challenge naturally arises in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) where the input is supplemented with multiple retrieved texts as the context. We present CacheBlend, a scheme that reuses the precomputed KV caches, regardless prefix or not, and selectively recomputes the KV values of a small subset of tokens to partially update each reused KV cache. In the meantime, the small extra delay for recomputing some tokens can be pipelined with the retrieval of KV caches within the same job, allowing CacheBlend to store KV caches in slower devices with more storage capacity while retrieving them without increasing the inference delay. By comparing CacheBlend with the state-of-the-art KV cache reusing schemes on three open-source LLMs of various sizes and four popular benchmark datasets of different tasks, we show that CacheBlend reduces time-to-first-token (TTFT) by 2.2-3.3x and increases the inference throughput by 2.8-5x from full KV recompute without compromising generation quality.

In real-world scenarios, user questions often require retrieving answers that are distributed across multiple tables. GraphRAG has recently attracted much attention for enhancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities by organizing external knowledge to address ad-hoc and complex questions, exemplifying a promising direction for cross-table question answering. In this paper, to address the current gap in available data, we first introduce a multi-table benchmark, MutliTableQA, comprising 60k tables and 25k user queries collected from real-world sources. Then, we propose the first Graph-Table-RAG framework, namely GTR, which reorganizes table corpora into a heterogeneous graph, employs a hierarchical coarse-to-fine retrieval process to extract the most relevant tables, and integrates graph-aware prompting for downstream LLMs' tabular reasoning. Extensive experiments show that GTR exhibits superior cross-table question-answering performance while maintaining high deployment efficiency, demonstrating its real-world practical applicability.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |

Large language models (LLMs) have made it significantly easier to prototype such retrieval and reasoning data pipelines. However, implementing these pipelines efficiently still demands significant effort and has several challenges. This often involves orchestrating heterogeneous data systems, managing data movement, and handling low-level implementation details, e.g., LLM context management. To address these challenges, we introduce FlockMTL: an extension for DBMSs that deeply integrates LLM capabilities and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). FlockMTL includes model-driven scalar and aggregate functions, enabling chained predictions through tuple-level mappings and reductions. Drawing inspiration from the relational model, FlockMTL incorporates: (i) cost-based optimizations, which seamlessly apply techniques such as batching and caching; and (ii) resource independence, enabled through novel SQL DDL abstractions: PROMPT and MODEL, introduced as first-class schema objects alongside TABLE. FlockMTL streamlines the development of knowledge-intensive analytical applications, and its optimizations ease the implementation burden.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Routing RAG: Binding Selective Retrieval with Knowledge Verbalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01018v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Selective retrieval improves retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by reducing distractions from low-quality retrievals and improving efficiency. However, existing approaches under-utilize the inherent knowledge of large language models (LLMs), leading to suboptimal retrieval decisions and degraded generation performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Self-Routing RAG (SR-RAG), a novel framework that binds selective retrieval with knowledge verbalization. SR-RAG enables an LLM to dynamically decide between external retrieval and verbalizing its own parametric knowledge. To this end, we design a multi-task objective that jointly optimizes an LLM on knowledge source selection, knowledge verbalization, and response generation. We further introduce dynamic knowledge source inference via nearest neighbor search to improve the accuracy of knowledge source decision under domain shifts. Fine-tuning three LLMs with SR-RAG significantly improves both their response accuracy and inference latency. Compared to the strongest selective retrieval baseline, SR-RAG reduces retrievals by 29% while improving the performance by 5.1%.</p></details> | Work in Progress |

RAG primarily relies on the query-chunk text-to-text similarity in the embedding space for retrieval and can fail to capture deeper semantic relationships across chunks, is highly sensitive to chunking strategies, and is prone to hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose TOBUGraph, a graph-based retrieval framework that first constructs the knowledge graph from unstructured data dynamically and automatically. Using LLMs, TOBUGraph extracts structured knowledge and diverse relationships among data, going beyond RAG's text-to-text similarity. Retrieval is achieved through graph traversal, leveraging the extracted relationships and structures to enhance retrieval accuracy, eliminating the need for chunking configurations while reducing hallucination. We demonstrate TOBUGraph's effectiveness in TOBU, a real-world application in production for personal memory organization and retrieval. Our evaluation using real user data demonstrates that TOBUGraph outperforms multiple RAG implementations in both precision and recall, significantly improving user experience through improved retrieval accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contradiction Detection in RAG Systems: Evaluating LLMs as Context Validators for Improved Information Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00180v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have emerged as a powerful method for enhancing large language models (LLMs) with up-to-date information. However, the retrieval step in RAG can sometimes surface documents containing contradictory information, particularly in rapidly evolving domains such as news. These contradictions can significantly impact the performance of LLMs, leading to inconsistent or erroneous outputs. This study addresses this critical challenge in two ways. First, we present a novel data generation framework to simulate different types of contradictions that may occur in the retrieval stage of a RAG system. Second, we evaluate the robustness of different LLMs in performing as context validators, assessing their ability to detect contradictory information within retrieved document sets. Our experimental results reveal that context validation remains a challenging task even for state-of-the-art LLMs, with performance varying significantly across different types of contradictions. While larger models generally perform better at contradiction detection, the effectiveness of different prompting strategies varies across tasks and model architectures. We find that chain-of-thought prompting shows notable improvements for some models but may hinder performance in others, highlighting the complexity of the task and the need for more robust approaches to context validation in RAG systems.</p></details> |  |

Using LLaMA 3, we evaluate these approaches on emotion classification and mental health condition detection tasks across two datasets. Fine-tuning achieves the highest accuracy (91% for emotion classification, 80% for mental health conditions) but requires substantial computational resources and large training sets, while prompt engineering and RAG offer more flexible deployment with moderate performance (40-68% accuracy). Our findings provide practical insights for implementing LLM-based solutions in mental health applications, highlighting the trade-offs between accuracy, computational requirements, and deployment flexibility.</p></details> |  |

A robust benchmark dataset must satisfy three key criteria: quality, diversity, and difficulty, which capturing the complexity of reasoning based on hops and the distribution of supporting evidence. In this paper, we propose MHTS (Multi-Hop Tree Structure), a novel dataset synthesis framework that systematically controls multi-hop reasoning complexity by leveraging a multi-hop tree structure to generate logically connected, multi-chunk queries. Our fine-grained difficulty estimation formula exhibits a strong correlation with the overall performance metrics of a RAG system, validating its effectiveness in assessing both retrieval and answer generation capabilities. By ensuring high-quality, diverse, and difficulty-controlled queries, our approach enhances RAG evaluation and benchmarking capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Systematic Knowledge Injection into Large Language Models via Diverse Augmentation for Domain-Specific RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08356v3)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a prominent method for incorporating domain knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs). While RAG enhances response relevance by incorporating retrieved domain knowledge in the context, retrieval errors can still lead to hallucinations and incorrect answers. To recover from retriever failures, domain knowledge is injected by fine-tuning the model to generate the correct response, even in the case of retrieval errors. However, we observe that without systematic knowledge augmentation, fine-tuned LLMs may memorize new information but still fail to extract relevant domain knowledge, leading to poor performance. In this work, we present a novel framework that significantly enhances the fine-tuning process by augmenting the training data in two ways -- context augmentation and knowledge paraphrasing. In context augmentation, we create multiple training samples for a given QA pair by varying the relevance of the retrieved information, teaching the model when to ignore and when to rely on retrieved content. In knowledge paraphrasing, we fine-tune with multiple answers to the same question, enabling LLMs to better internalize specialized knowledge. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting due to fine-tuning, we add a domain-specific identifier to a question and also utilize a replay buffer containing general QA pairs. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our method over existing techniques, achieving up to 10\% relative gain in token-level recall while preserving the LLM's generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 14 tables, to be published in NAACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[Does RAG Introduce Unfairness in LLMs? Evaluating Fairness in Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19804v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has recently gained significant attention for its enhanced ability to integrate external knowledge sources into open-domain question answering (QA) tasks. However, it remains unclear how these models address fairness concerns, particularly with respect to sensitive attributes such as gender, geographic location, and other demographic factors. First, as language models evolve to prioritize utility, like improving exact match accuracy, fairness considerations may have been largely overlooked. Second, the complex, multi-component architecture of RAG methods poses challenges in identifying and mitigating biases, as each component is optimized for distinct objectives. In this paper, we aim to empirically evaluate fairness in several RAG methods. We propose a fairness evaluation framework tailored to RAG, using scenario-based questions and analyzing disparities across demographic attributes. Our experimental results indicate that, despite recent advances in utility-driven optimization, fairness issues persist in both the retrieval and generation stages. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions to address fairness concerns throughout the RAG pipeline.

To enrich the RAG context, we propose providing Large Language Models (LLMs) with author-specific features, such as average sentiment polarity and frequently used words, in addition to past samples from the author's profile. We introduce a new feature called Contrastive Examples: documents from other authors are retrieved to help LLM identify what makes an author's style unique in comparison to others. Our experiments show that adding a couple of sentences about the named entities, dependency patterns, and words a person uses frequently significantly improves personalized text generation. Combining features with contrastive examples boosts the performance further, achieving a relative 15% improvement over baseline RAG while outperforming the benchmarks. Our results show the value of fine-grained features for better personalization, while opening a new research dimension for including contrastive examples as a complement with RAG. We release our code publicly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Balancing Content Size in RAG-Text2SQL System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15723v3)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising solution for converting natural language queries into SQL commands, enabling seamless database interaction. However, these Text-to-SQL (Text2SQL) systems face inherent limitations, hallucinations, outdated knowledge, and untraceable reasoning. To address these challenges, the integration of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with Text2SQL models has gained traction. RAG serves as a retrieval mechanism, providing essential contextual information, such as table schemas and metadata, to enhance the query generation process. Despite their potential, RAG + Text2SQL systems are susceptible to the quality and size of retrieved documents. While richer document content can improve schema relevance and retrieval accuracy, it also introduces noise, increasing the risk of hallucinations and reducing query fidelity as the prompt size of the Text2SQL model increases. This research investigates the nuanced trade-off between document size and quality, aiming to strike a balance that optimizes system performance. Key thresholds are identified where performance degradation occurs, along with actionable strategies to mitigate these challenges. Additionally, we explore the phenomenon of hallucinations in Text2SQL models, emphasizing the critical role of curated document presentation in minimizing errors. Our findings provide a roadmap for enhancing the robustness of RAG + Text2SQL systems, offering practical insights for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

We propose a dynamic retrieval gating mechanism coupled with expert routing, enabling the model to selectively consult an external knowledge store or rely on specialized internal experts based on the query's needs. The paper lays out the theoretical foundations of ExpertRAG, including a probabilistic formulation that treats retrieval and expert selection as latent decisions, and mathematical justifications for its efficiency in both computation and knowledge utilization. We derive formulae to quantify the expected computational cost savings from selective retrieval and the capacity gains from sparse expert utilization. A comparative analysis positions ExpertRAG against standard RAG (with always-on retrieval) and pure MoE models (e.g., Switch Transformer, Mixtral) to highlight its unique balance between parametric knowledge and non-parametric retrieval. We also outline an experimental validation strategy, proposing benchmarks and evaluation protocols to test ExpertRAG's performance on factual recall, generalization, and inference efficiency. The proposed framework, although presented theoretically, is supported by insights from prior work in RAG and MoE, and is poised to provide more factual, efficient, and adaptive generation by leveraging the best of both paradigms. In summary, ExpertRAG contributes a new perspective on scaling and augmenting language models, backed by a thorough analysis and a roadmap for empirical validation.</p></details> | 30 pages, 4 figures |

The two mainstream solutions to incorporate memory into the generation process are long-context LLMs and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). In this paper, we first systematically compare these two types of solutions on three renovated/new datasets and show that (1) long-context solutions, although more expensive, shall be easier to capture the big picture and better answer queries which require considering the memory as a whole; and (2) when the queries concern specific information, RAG solutions shall be more competitive especially when the keywords can be explicitly matched. Therefore, we propose a novel method RAG-Tuned-LLM which fine-tunes a relative small (e.g., 7B) LLM using the data generated following the RAG principles, so it can combine the advantages of both solutions. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that RAG-Tuned-LLM can beat long-context LLMs and RAG methods across a wide range of query types.</p></details> |  |

The recent purposed Mixed-Precision Over-the-Air Federated Learning (MP-OTA-FL) enables clients to operate at appropriate precision levels based on their heterogeneous hardware, taking advantages of the larger trade-off space while covering the quantization overheads in the mixed-precision modulation scheme for the OTA aggregation process. A key to further exploring the potential of the MP-OTA-FL framework is the optimization of client precision levels. The choice of precision level hinges on multifaceted factors including hardware capability, potential client contribution, and user satisfaction, among which factors can be difficult to define or quantify. In this paper, we propose a RAG-based User Profiling for precision planning framework that integrates retrieval-augmented LLMs and dynamic client profiling to optimize satisfaction and contributions. This includes a hybrid interface for gathering device/user insights and an RAG database storing historical quantization decisions with feedback. Experiments show that our method boosts satisfaction, energy savings, and global model accuracy in MP-OTA-FL systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, submitted to IEEE VTC 2025 fall for possible publication</p></details> |

Chatbots as question-answering systems can help in solving these challenges. LLM chatbots use NLP techniques to establish connections between topics and accurately respond to complex questions. These capabilities make it perfect for enlightenment on religion as a question-answering chatbot. However, LLMs also tend to generate false information, known as hallucination. Also, the chatbots' responses can include content that insults personal religious beliefs, interfaith conflicts, and controversial or sensitive topics. It must avoid such cases without promoting hate speech or offending certain groups of people or their beliefs. This study uses a vector database-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to enhance the accuracy and transparency of LLMs. Our question-answering system is called "MufassirQAS". We created a database consisting of several open-access books that include Turkish context. These books contain Turkish translations and interpretations of Islam. This database is utilized to answer religion-related questions and ensure our answers are trustworthy. The relevant part of the dataset, which LLM also uses, is presented along with the answer. We have put careful effort into creating system prompts that give instructions to prevent harmful, offensive, or disrespectful responses to respect people's values and provide reliable results. The system answers and shares additional information, such as the page number from the respective book and the articles referenced for obtaining the information. MufassirQAS and ChatGPT are also tested with sensitive questions. We got better performance with our system. Study and enhancements are still in progress. Results and future works are given.</p></details> |  |
| **[SOSecure: Safer Code Generation with RAG and StackOverflow Discussions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13654v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for automated code generation. Their reliance on infrequently updated pretraining data leaves them unaware of newly discovered vulnerabilities and evolving security standards, making them prone to producing insecure code. In contrast, developer communities on Stack Overflow (SO) provide an ever-evolving repository of knowledge, where security vulnerabilities are actively discussed and addressed through collective expertise. These community-driven insights remain largely untapped by LLMs. This paper introduces SOSecure, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that leverages the collective security expertise found in SO discussions to improve the security of LLM-generated code. We build a security-focused knowledge base by extracting SO answers and comments that explicitly identify vulnerabilities. Unlike common uses of RAG, SOSecure triggers after code has been generated to find discussions that identify flaws in similar code. These are used in a prompt to an LLM to consider revising the code. Evaluation across three datasets (SALLM, LLMSecEval, and LMSys) show that SOSecure achieves strong fix rates of 71.7%, 91.3%, and 96.7% respectively, compared to prompting GPT-4 without relevant discussions (49.1%, 56.5%, and 37.5%), and outperforms multiple other baselines. SOSecure operates as a language-agnostic complement to existing LLMs, without requiring retraining or fine-tuning, making it easy to deploy. Our results underscore the importance of maintaining active developer forums, which have dropped substantially in usage with LLM adoptions.</p></details> |  |

MES-RAG introduces proactive security measures that ensure system integrity by applying protections prior to data access. Additionally, the system supports real-time multi-modal outputs, including text, images, audio, and video, seamlessly integrating into existing RAG architectures. Experimental results demonstrate that MES-RAG significantly improves both accuracy and recall, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing the security and utility of question-answering, increasing accuracy to 0.83 (+0.25) on targeted task.

| **[Privacy-Aware RAG: Secure and Isolated Knowledge Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15548v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in real-world applications has heightened concerns about the confidentiality and integrity of their proprietary knowledge bases. These knowledge bases, which play a critical role in enhancing the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly vulnerable to breaches that could compromise sensitive information. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an advanced encryption methodology designed to protect RAG systems from unauthorized access and data leakage. Our approach encrypts both textual content and its corresponding embeddings prior to storage, ensuring that all data remains securely encrypted. This mechanism restricts access to authorized entities with the appropriate decryption keys, thereby significantly reducing the risk of unintended data exposure. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our encryption strategy preserves the performance and functionality of RAG pipelines, ensuring compatibility across diverse domains and applications. To validate the robustness of our method, we provide comprehensive security proofs that highlight its resilience against potential threats and vulnerabilities. These proofs also reveal limitations in existing approaches, which often lack robustness, adaptability, or reliance on open-source models. Our findings suggest that integrating advanced encryption techniques into the design and deployment of RAG systems can effectively enhance privacy safeguards. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on improving security measures for AI-driven services and advocates for stricter data protection standards within RAG architectures.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advancements, LLMs still face significant challenges in reasoning with structured data, handling dynamic knowledge evolution, and mitigating hallucinations, particularly in mission-critical domains. Our proposed RAG-KG-IL framework addresses these limitations by employing a multi-agent architecture that enables continuous knowledge updates, integrates structured knowledge, and incorporates autonomous agents for enhanced explainability and reasoning. The framework utilizes RAG to ensure the generated responses are grounded in verifiable information, while KGs provide structured domain knowledge for improved consistency and depth of understanding. The Incremental Learning approach allows for dynamic updates to the knowledge base without full retraining, significantly reducing computational overhead and improving the model's adaptability. We evaluate the framework using real-world case studies involving health-related queries, comparing it to state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o and a RAG-only baseline. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces hallucination rates and improves answer completeness and reasoning accuracy. The results underscore the potential of combining RAG, KGs, and multi-agent systems to create intelligent, adaptable systems capable of real-time knowledge integration and reasoning in complex domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Relevance Isn't All You Need: Scaling RAG Systems With Inference-Time Compute Via Multi-Criteria Reranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07104v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern Large Language Model (LLM) systems typically rely on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) which aims to gather context that is useful for response generation. These RAG systems typically optimize strictly towards retrieving context that is maximally relevant to the query. However, conventional theory suggests that retrieval systems which seek to maximize context relevance without any additional explicit criteria can create information bottlenecks. We reaffirm this finding in the modern age of LLM's by showing that in standard RAG pipelines, maximizing for context relevance alone can degrade downstream response quality. In response, we show evaluations of existing RAG methods which account for both context relevance and answer quality. These evaluations introduce a novel finding that existing RAG systems scale poorly with inference time compute usage when considering our combined metric. We introduce "RErank BEyond reLevance (REBEL)", which enables RAG systems to scale with inference-time compute via injection of multi-criteria optimization using Chain-of-Thought prompting (and optionally Multi-Turn dialogue). Ultimately, this enables a new performance/speed tradeoff curve, where RAG systems are able to achieve both higher relevance of retrieved contexts and superior answer quality as inference time increases. Code for the implementation of our method in llama-index can be found at the following PR: https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/pull/17590. Code for running experiments using this llama-index implementation can be found at https://github.com/microsoft/REBEL.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional AI pipelines based on deep neural visual architectures such as CNNs or ViTs face limitations such as degraded performance on the long-tail of classes and the inability to reason about their predictions. We integrate image captioning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) to enhance biodiversity monitoring, showing particular promise for characterizing rare and unknown arthropod species. While a naive Vision-Language Model (VLM) excels in classifying images of common species, the RAG model enables classification of rarer taxa by matching explicit textual descriptions of taxonomic features to contextual biodiversity text data from external sources. The RAG model shows promise in reducing overconfidence and enhancing accuracy relative to naive LLMs, suggesting its viability in capturing the nuances of taxonomic hierarchy, particularly at the challenging family and genus levels. Our findings highlight the potential for modern vision-language AI pipelines to support biodiversity conservation initiatives, emphasizing the role of comprehensive data curation and collaboration with citizen science platforms to improve species identification, unknown species characterization and ultimately inform conservation strategies.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |

In the Query-Focused Summarization (QFS) task, GraphRAG-based approaches have notably enhanced the comprehensiveness and diversity of generated responses. However, existing GraphRAG-based approaches predominantly focus on coarse-grained information summarization without being aware of the specific query, and the retrieved content lacks sufficient contextual information to generate comprehensive responses. To address the deficiencies of current RAG systems, we propose Context-Aware Fine-Grained Graph RAG (FG-RAG) to enhance the performance of the QFS task. FG-RAG employs Context-Aware Entity Expansion in graph retrieval to expand the coverage of retrieved entities in the graph, thus providing enough contextual information for the retrieved content. Furthermore, FG-RAG utilizes Query-Level Fine-Grained Summarization to incorporate fine-grained details during response generation, enhancing query awareness for the generated summarization. Our evaluation demonstrates that FG-RAG outperforms other RAG systems in multiple metrics of comprehensiveness, diversity, and empowerment when handling the QFS task.

This paper introduces ClaimTrust, a propagation-based trust scoring framework that dynamically evaluates the reliability of documents in a RAG system. Using a modified PageRank-inspired algorithm, ClaimTrust propagates trust scores across documents based on relationships derived from extracted factual claims. We preprocess and analyze 814 political news articles from Kaggle's Fake News Detection Dataset to extract 2,173 unique claims and classify 965 meaningful relationships (supporting or contradicting). By representing the dataset as a document graph, ClaimTrust iteratively updates trust scores until convergence, effectively differentiating trustworthy articles from unreliable ones. Our methodology, which leverages embedding-based filtering for efficient claim comparison and relationship classification, achieves a 11.2% of significant connections while maintaining computational scalability. Experimental results demonstrate that ClaimTrust successfully assigns higher trust scores to verified documents while penalizing those containing false information. Future directions include fine-tuned claim extract and compare (Li et al., 2022), parameter optimization, enhanced language model utilization, and robust evaluation metrics to generalize the framework across diverse datasets and domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

To effectively assess their video comprehension capabilities, long video understanding benchmarks, such as Video-MME and MLVU, are proposed. However, these benchmarks directly use uniform frame sampling for testing, which results in significant information loss and affects the accuracy of the evaluations in reflecting the true abilities of MLLMs. To address this, we propose RAG-Adapter, a plug-and-play framework that reduces information loss during testing by sampling frames most relevant to the given question. Additionally, we introduce a Grouped-supervised Contrastive Learning (GCL) method to further enhance sampling effectiveness of RAG-Adapter through fine-tuning on our constructed MMAT dataset. Finally, we test numerous baseline MLLMs on various video understanding benchmarks, finding that RAG-Adapter sampling consistently outperforms uniform sampling (e.g., Accuracy of GPT-4o increases by 9.3 percent on Video-MME), providing a more accurate testing method for long video benchmarks.</p></details> | 37 pages, 36 figures |

Predictive maintenance (PdM) in such settings demands methodologies that are adaptive, transferable, and capable of integrating domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we present RAAD-LLM, a novel framework for adaptive anomaly detection, leveraging large language models (LLMs) integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This approach addresses the aforementioned PdM challenges. By effectively utilizing domain-specific knowledge, RAAD-LLM enhances the detection of anomalies in time series data without requiring fine-tuning on specific datasets. The framework's adaptability mechanism enables it to adjust its understanding of normal operating conditions dynamically, thus increasing detection accuracy. We validate this methodology through a real-world application for a plastics manufacturing plant and the Skoltech Anomaly Benchmark (SKAB). Results show significant improvements over our previous model with an accuracy increase from 70.7% to 88.6% on the real-world dataset. By allowing for the enriching of input series data with semantics, RAAD-LLM incorporates multimodal capabilities that facilitate more collaborative decision-making between the model and plant operators. Overall, our findings support RAAD-LLM's ability to revolutionize anomaly detection methodologies in PdM, potentially leading to a paradigm shift in how anomaly detection is implemented across various industries.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2411.00914</p></details> |

To bridge this gap, we introduce OpenRAG, a RAG framework that is optimized end-to-end by tuning the retriever to capture in-context relevance, enabling adaptation to the diverse and evolving needs. Extensive experiments across a wide range of tasks demonstrate that OpenRAG, by tuning a retriever end-to-end, leads to a consistent improvement of 4.0% over the original retriever, consistently outperforming existing state-of-the-art retrievers by 2.1%. Additionally, our results indicate that for some tasks, an end-to-end tuned 0.2B retriever can achieve improvements that surpass those of RAG-oriented or instruction-tuned 8B large language models (LLMs), highlighting the cost-effectiveness of our approach in enhancing RAG systems.</p></details> |  |

As an essential part of RAG, external knowledge bases are commonly built by extracting structured data from unstructured PDF documents using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However, given the imperfect prediction of OCR and the inherent non-uniform representation of structured data, knowledge bases inevitably contain various OCR noises. In this paper, we introduce OHRBench, the first benchmark for understanding the cascading impact of OCR on RAG systems. OHRBench includes 8,561 carefully selected unstructured document images from seven real-world RAG application domains, along with 8,498 Q&A pairs derived from multimodal elements in documents, challenging existing OCR solutions used for RAG. To better understand OCR's impact on RAG systems, we identify two primary types of OCR noise: Semantic Noise and Formatting Noise and apply perturbation to generate a set of structured data with varying degrees of each OCR noise. Using OHRBench, we first conduct a comprehensive evaluation of current OCR solutions and reveal that none is competent for constructing high-quality knowledge bases for RAG systems. We then systematically evaluate the impact of these two noise types and demonstrate the trend relationship between the degree of OCR noise and RAG performance.

We demonstrate that RAG systems that operate on databases with untrusted content are vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks we call jamming. An adversary can add a single ``blocker'' document to the database that will be retrieved in response to a specific query and result in the RAG system not answering this query, ostensibly because it lacks relevant information or because the answer is unsafe. We describe and measure the efficacy of several methods for generating blocker documents, including a new method based on black-box optimization. Our method (1) does not rely on instruction injection, (2) does not require the adversary to know the embedding or LLM used by the target RAG system, and (3) does not employ an auxiliary LLM. We evaluate jamming attacks on several embeddings and LLMs and demonstrate that the existing safety metrics for LLMs do not capture their vulnerability to jamming. We then discuss defenses against blocker documents.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in USENIX Security Symposium 2025</p></details> |

However, the specialized nature of biochemical data often necessitates costly domain-specific fine-tuning, posing critical challenges. First, it hinders the application of more flexible general-purpose LLMs in cutting-edge drug discovery tasks. More importantly, it impedes the rapid integration of the vast amounts of scientific data continuously generated through experiments and research. To investigate these challenges, we propose CLADD, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-empowered agentic system tailored to drug discovery tasks. Through the collaboration of multiple LLM agents, CLADD dynamically retrieves information from biomedical knowledge bases, contextualizes query molecules, and integrates relevant evidence to generate responses -- all without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. Crucially, we tackle key obstacles in applying RAG workflows to biochemical data, including data heterogeneity, ambiguity, and multi-source integration. We demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of this framework across a variety of drug discovery tasks, showing that it outperforms general-purpose and domain-specific LLMs as well as traditional deep learning approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Machi...</summary><p>Machine Learning, Drug Discovery</p></details> |
| **[SmartRAG: Jointly Learn RAG-Related Tasks From the Environment Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18141v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RAG systems consist of multiple modules to work together. However, these modules are usually separately trained. We argue that a system like RAG that incorporates multiple modules should be jointly optimized to achieve optimal performance. To demonstrate this, we design a specific pipeline called \textbf{SmartRAG} that includes a policy network and a retriever. The policy network can serve as 1) a decision maker that decides when to retrieve, 2) a query rewriter to generate a query most suited to the retriever, and 3) an answer generator that produces the final response with/without the observations. We then propose to jointly optimize the whole system using a reinforcement learning algorithm, with the reward designed to encourage the system to achieve the best performance with minimal retrieval cost. When jointly optimized, all the modules can be aware of how other modules are working and thus find the best way to work together as a complete system. Empirical results demonstrate that the jointly optimized SmartRAG can achieve better performance than separately optimized counterparts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human Cognition Inspired RAG with Knowledge Graph for Complex Problem Solving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06567v1)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential across various domains, yet they face significant challenges in knowledge integration and complex problem reasoning, often leading to hallucinations and unreliable outputs. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution to enhance LLMs accuracy by incorporating external knowledge. However, traditional RAG systems struggle with processing complex relational information and multi-step reasoning, limiting their effectiveness in advanced problem-solving tasks. To address these limitations, we propose CogGRAG, a cognition inspired graph-based RAG framework, designed to improve LLMs performance in Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA). Inspired by the human cognitive process of decomposing complex problems and performing self-verification, our framework introduces a three-stage methodology: decomposition, retrieval, and reasoning with self-verification. By integrating these components, CogGRAG enhances the accuracy of LLMs in complex problem solving. We conduct systematic experiments with three LLM backbones on four benchmark datasets, where CogGRAG outperforms the baselines.</p></details> |  |

While RAG enhances MLLMs by grounding responses in query-relevant external knowledge, this reliance poses a critical yet underexplored safety risk: knowledge poisoning attacks, where misinformation or irrelevant knowledge is intentionally injected into external knowledge bases to manipulate model outputs to be incorrect and even harmful. To expose such vulnerabilities in multimodal RAG, we propose MM-PoisonRAG, a novel knowledge poisoning attack framework with two attack strategies: Localized Poisoning Attack (LPA), which injects query-specific misinformation in both text and images for targeted manipulation, and Globalized Poisoning Attack (GPA) to provide false guidance during MLLM generation to elicit nonsensical responses across all queries. We evaluate our attacks across multiple tasks, models, and access settings, demonstrating that LPA successfully manipulates the MLLM to generate attacker-controlled answers, with a success rate of up to 56% on MultiModalQA. Moreover, GPA completely disrupts model generation to 0% accuracy with just a single irrelevant knowledge injection. Our results highlight the urgent need for robust defenses against knowledge poisoning to safeguard multimodal RAG frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/HyeonjeongHa/MM-PoisonRAG</p></details> |
| **[Improving RAG Retrieval via Propositional Content Extraction: a Speech Act Theory Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10654v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When users formulate queries, they often include not only the information they seek, but also pragmatic markers such as interrogative phrasing or polite requests. Although these speech act indicators communicate the user\textquotesingle s intent -- whether it is asking a question, making a request, or stating a fact -- they do not necessarily add to the core informational content of the query itself. This paper investigates whether extracting the underlying propositional content from user utterances -- essentially stripping away the linguistic markers of intent -- can improve retrieval quality in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Drawing upon foundational insights from speech act theory, we propose a practical method for automatically transforming queries into their propositional equivalents before embedding. To assess the efficacy of this approach, we conducted an experimental study involving 63 user queries related to a Brazilian telecommunications news corpus with precomputed semantic embeddings. Results demonstrate clear improvements in semantic similarity between query embeddings and document embeddings at top ranks, confirming that queries stripped of speech act indicators more effectively retrieve relevant content.</p></details> | 19 pages, 4 figures |

Built from heterologous data of NASDAQ 100 companies, FinTMMBench offers three significant advantages. 1) Multi-modal Corpus: It encompasses a hybrid of financial tables, news articles, daily stock prices, and visual technical charts as the corpus. 2) Temporal-aware Questions: Each question requires the retrieval and interpretation of its relevant data over a specific time period, including daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual periods. 3) Diverse Financial Analysis Tasks: The questions involve 10 different tasks, including information extraction, trend analysis, sentiment analysis and event detection, etc. We further propose a novel TMMHybridRAG method, which first leverages LLMs to convert data from other modalities (e.g., tabular, visual and time-series data) into textual format and then incorporates temporal information in each node when constructing graphs and dense indexes. Its effectiveness has been validated in extensive experiments, but notable gaps remain, highlighting the challenges presented by our FinTMMBench.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Beyond RAG: Task-Aware KV Cache Compression for Comprehensive Knowledge Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04973v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incorporating external knowledge in large language models (LLMs) enhances their utility across diverse applications, but existing methods have trade-offs. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) fetches evidence via similarity search, but key information may fall outside top ranked results. Long-context models can process multiple documents but are computationally expensive and limited by context window size. Inspired by students condensing study material for open-book exams, we propose task-aware key-value (KV) cache compression, which compresses external knowledge in a zero- or few-shot setup. This enables LLMs to reason efficiently over a compacted representation of all relevant information. Experiments show our approach outperforms both RAG and task-agnostic compression methods. On LongBench v2, it improves accuracy by up to 7 absolute points over RAG with a 30x compression rate, while reducing inference latency from 0.43s to 0.16s. A synthetic dataset highlights that RAG performs well when sparse evidence suffices, whereas task-aware compression is superior for broad knowledge tasks.</p></details> |  |

Although previous studies noted that retrieving many documents can degrade performance, they did not isolate how the quantity of documents affects performance while controlling for context length. We evaluate various language models on custom datasets derived from a multi-hop QA task. We keep the context length and position of relevant information constant while varying the number of documents, and find that increasing the document count in RAG settings poses significant challenges for LLMs. Additionally, our results indicate that processing multiple documents is a separate challenge from handling long contexts. We also make the datasets and code available: https://github.com/shaharl6000/MoreDocsSameLen .</p></details> | Preprint |

A number of graph-based RAG methods have been proposed in the literature. However, these methods have not been systematically and comprehensively compared under the same experimental settings. In this paper, we first summarize a unified framework to incorporate all graph-based RAG methods from a high-level perspective. We then extensively compare representative graph-based RAG methods over a range of questing-answering (QA) datasets -- from specific questions to abstract questions -- and examine the effectiveness of all methods, providing a thorough analysis of graph-based RAG approaches. As a byproduct of our experimental analysis, we are also able to identify new variants of the graph-based RAG methods over specific QA and abstract QA tasks respectively, by combining existing techniques, which outperform the state-of-the-art methods. Finally, based on these findings, we offer promising research opportunities. We believe that a deeper understanding of the behavior of existing methods can provide new valuable insights for future research.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers an effective method for achieving this by retrieving the most relevant fragments into LLMs. However, the advancements in context window size for LLMs offer an alternative approach, raising the question of whether RAG remains necessary for effectively handling external knowledge. Several existing studies provide inconclusive comparisons between RAG and long-context (LC) LLMs, largely due to limitations in the benchmark designs. In this paper, we present LaRA, a novel benchmark specifically designed to rigorously compare RAG and LC LLMs. LaRA encompasses 2326 test cases across four practical QA task categories and three types of naturally occurring long texts. Through systematic evaluation of seven open-source and four proprietary LLMs, we find that the optimal choice between RAG and LC depends on a complex interplay of factors, including the model's parameter size, long-text capabilities, context length, task type, and the characteristics of the retrieved chunks. Our findings provide actionable guidelines for practitioners to effectively leverage both RAG and LC approaches in developing and deploying LLM applications.

While many studies focus on evaluating the overall quality of end-to-end RAG systems, there is a gap in understanding the appropriateness of LLMs for the RAG task. To address this, we introduce Trust-Score, a holistic metric that evaluates the trustworthiness of LLMs within the RAG framework. Our results show that various prompting methods, such as in-context learning, fail to effectively adapt LLMs to the RAG task as measured by Trust-Score. Consequently, we propose Trust-Align, a method to align LLMs for improved Trust-Score performance. 26 out of 27 models aligned using Trust-Align substantially outperform competitive baselines on ASQA, QAMPARI, and ELI5. Specifically, in LLaMA-3-8b, Trust-Align outperforms FRONT on ASQA (up 12.56), QAMPARI (up 36.04), and ELI5 (up 17.69). Trust-Align also significantly enhances models' ability to correctly refuse and provide quality citations. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of Trust-Align across different open-weight models, including the LLaMA series (1b to 8b), Qwen-2.5 series (0.5b to 7b), and Phi3.5 (3.8b). We release our code at https://github.com/declare-lab/trust-align.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |

However, evaluating the effectiveness of RAG systems in specialized scenarios remains challenging due to the high costs of data construction and the lack of suitable evaluation metrics. This paper introduces RAGEval, a framework designed to assess RAG systems across diverse scenarios by generating high-quality documents, questions, answers, and references through a schema-based pipeline. With a focus on factual accuracy, we propose three novel metrics: Completeness, Hallucination, and Irrelevance to evaluate LLM generated responses rigorously. Experimental results show that RAGEval outperforms zero-shot and one-shot methods in terms of clarity, safety, conformity, and richness of generated samples. Furthermore, the use of LLMs for scoring the proposed metrics demonstrates a high level of consistency with human evaluations. RAGEval establishes a new paradigm for evaluating RAG systems in real-world applications.

| **[SAGE: A Framework of Precise Retrieval for RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01713v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated significant proficiency in conducting question-answering (QA) tasks within a specified corpus. Nonetheless, numerous failure instances of RAG in QA still exist. These failures are not solely attributable to the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs); instead, they predominantly arise from the retrieval of inaccurate information for LLMs due to two limitations: (1) Current RAG methods segment the corpus without considering semantics, making it difficult to find relevant context due to impaired correlation between questions and the segments. (2) There is a trade-off between missing essential context with fewer context retrieved and getting irrelevant context with more context retrieved. In this paper, we introduce a RAG framework (SAGE), to overcome these limitations. First, to address the segmentation issue without considering semantics, we propose to train a semantic segmentation model. This model is trained to segment the corpus into semantically complete chunks. Second, to ensure that only the most relevant chunks are retrieved while the irrelevant ones are ignored, we design a chunk selection algorithm to dynamically select chunks based on the decreasing speed of the relevance score, leading to a more relevant selection. Third, to further ensure the precision of the retrieved chunks, we propose letting LLMs assess whether retrieved chunks are excessive or lacking and then adjust the amount of context accordingly. Experiments show that SAGE outperforms baselines by 61.25% in the quality of QA on average. Moreover, by avoiding retrieving noisy context, SAGE lowers the cost of the tokens consumed in LLM inference and achieves a 49.41% enhancement in cost efficiency on average. Additionally, our work offers valuable insights for boosting RAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retrieval-Augmented Perception: High-Resolution Image Perception Meets Visual RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01222v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-resolution (HR) image perception remains a key challenge in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To overcome the limitations of existing methods, this paper shifts away from prior dedicated heuristic approaches and revisits the most fundamental idea to HR perception by enhancing the long-context capability of MLLMs, driven by recent advances in long-context techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for general LLMs. Towards this end, this paper presents the first study exploring the use of RAG to address HR perception challenges. Specifically, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Perception (RAP), a training-free framework that retrieves and fuses relevant image crops while preserving spatial context using the proposed Spatial-Awareness Layout. To accommodate different tasks, the proposed Retrieved-Exploration Search (RE-Search) dynamically selects the optimal number of crops based on model confidence and retrieval scores. Experimental results on HR benchmarks demonstrate the significant effectiveness of RAP, with LLaVA-v1.5-13B achieving a 43% improvement on $V^*$ Bench and 19% on HR-Bench.</p></details> |  |

Recent progress in Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) has opened up new possibilities for interactive diagnostic tools. However, these models often suffer from factual hallucination, which can lead to incorrect diagnoses. Fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have emerged as methods to address these issues. However, the amount of high-quality data and distribution shifts between training data and deployment data limit the application of fine-tuning methods. Although RAG is lightweight and effective, existing RAG-based approaches are not sufficiently general to different medical domains and can potentially cause misalignment issues, both between modalities and between the model and the ground truth. In this paper, we propose a versatile multimodal RAG system, MMed-RAG, designed to enhance the factuality of Med-LVLMs. Our approach introduces a domain-aware retrieval mechanism, an adaptive retrieved contexts selection method, and a provable RAG-based preference fine-tuning strategy. These innovations make the RAG process sufficiently general and reliable, significantly improving alignment when introducing retrieved contexts. Experimental results across five medical datasets (involving radiology, ophthalmology, pathology) on medical VQA and report generation demonstrate that MMed-RAG can achieve an average improvement of 43.8% in the factual accuracy of Med-LVLMs. Our data and code are available in https://github.com/richard-peng-xia/MMed-RAG.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

In this paper, we propose a generative AI-powered GATE question-answering framework (GATE stands for Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering) that leverages LLMs to explain GATE solutions and support students in their exam preparation. We conducted extensive benchmarking to select the optimal embedding model and LLM, evaluating our framework based on criteria such as latency, faithfulness, and relevance, with additional validation through human evaluation. Our chatbot integrates state-of-the-art embedding models and LLMs to deliver accurate, context-aware responses. Through rigorous experimentation, we identified configurations that balance performance and computational efficiency, ensuring a reliable chatbot to serve students' needs. Additionally, we discuss the challenges faced in data processing and modeling and implemented solutions. Our work explores the application of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for GATE Q/A explanation tasks, and our findings demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and response quality. This research offers practical insights for developing effective AI-driven educational tools while highlighting areas for future enhancement in usability and scalability.</p></details> |  |

However, current RAG methods rely on agent-specific strategies for individual data sources, posing challenges low-resource or black-box environments and complicates operations when evidence is fragmented across sources. To address these limitations, we propose ER-RAG, a framework that unifies evidence integration across heterogeneous data sources using the Entity-Relationship (ER) model. ER-RAG standardizes entity retrieval and relationship querying through ER-based APIs with GET and JOIN operations. It employs a two-stage generation process: first, a preference optimization module selects optimal sources; second, another module constructs API chains based on source schemas. This unified approach allows efficient fine-tuning and seamless integration across diverse data sources. ER-RAG demonstrated its effectiveness by winning all three tracks of the 2024 KDDCup CRAG Challenge, achieving performance on par with commercial RAG pipelines using an 8B LLM backbone. It outperformed hybrid competitors by 3.1% in LLM score and accelerated retrieval by 5.5X.</p></details> |  |
| **[Post-training an LLM for RAG? Train on Self-Generated Demonstrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10596v2)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with knowledge intensive NLP tasks, such as answering "Who won the latest World Cup?" because the knowledge they learn during training may be insufficient or outdated. Conditioning generation on retrieved documents -- a technique known as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) -- mitigates these shortcomings by allowing the model to leverage in-context information. Practitioners can improve LLM RAG performance by fine-tuning on retrieval-augmented instructions, but must beware that this can cause undesirable model behaviors like hallucinations. We attribute this degradation to the fact that the training data is likely to be out-of-distribution for the model and may suffer from quality issues, such as misalignment between retrievals and target responses (since retrievals are frequently added post-hoc). We propose a recipe for training RAG-enabled LLMs using self-generated demonstrations, thereby avoiding training on out-of-distribution text and integrating retrievals into the LLM responses. We evaluate our method on knowledge intensive question answering (QA) tasks and show that our method teaches LLMs to properly handle in-context retrievals and abstain from questions it will likely get wrong. Compared to conventional RA-IT methods, our method prevents model degradation in non-RAG settings while exhibiting superior QA performance.</p></details> |  |

To address the fragmented evaluation paradigms and limited cases in existing Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH), this paper introduces U-NIAH, a unified framework that systematically compares LLMs and RAG methods in controlled long context settings. Our framework extends beyond traditional NIAH by incorporating multi-needle, long-needle, and needle-in-needle configurations, along with different retrieval settings, while leveraging the synthetic Starlight Academy dataset-a fictional magical universe-to eliminate biases from pre-trained knowledge. Through extensive experiments, we investigate three research questions: (1) performance trade-offs between LLMs and RAG, (2) error patterns in RAG, and (3) RAG's limitations in complex settings. Our findings show that RAG significantly enhances smaller LLMs by mitigating the "lost-in-the-middle" effect and improving robustness, achieving an 82.58% win-rate over LLMs. However, we observe that retrieval noise and reverse chunk ordering degrade performance, while surprisingly, advanced reasoning LLMs exhibit reduced RAG compatibility due to sensitivity to semantic distractors. We identify typical error patterns including omission due to noise, hallucination under high noise critical condition, and self-doubt behaviors. Our work not only highlights the complementary roles of RAG and LLMs, but also provides actionable insights for optimizing deployments.

However, these models face challenges in retrieving precise information from vast datasets. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) was developed to combining LLMs with external information retrieval systems to enhance the accuracy and context of responses. Despite improvements, RAG still struggles with comprehensive retrieval in high-volume, low-information-density databases and lacks relational awareness, leading to fragmented answers. To address this, this paper introduces the Pseudo-Knowledge Graph (PKG) framework, designed to overcome these limitations by integrating Meta-path Retrieval, In-graph Text and Vector Retrieval into LLMs. By preserving natural language text and leveraging various retrieval techniques, the PKG offers a richer knowledge representation and improves accuracy in information retrieval. Extensive evaluations using Open Compass and MultiHop-RAG benchmarks demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in managing large volumes of data and complex relationships.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods rely on unrealistic white-box assumptions, such as attackers having access to RAG systems' internal processes. To address this issue, we introduce a realistic black-box attack scenario based on the RAG paradox, where RAG systems inadvertently expose vulnerabilities while attempting to enhance trustworthiness. Because RAG systems reference external documents during response generation, our attack targets these sources without requiring internal access. Our approach first identifies the external sources disclosed by RAG systems and then automatically generates poisoned documents with misinformation designed to match these sources. Finally, these poisoned documents are newly published on the disclosed sources, disrupting the RAG system's response generation process. Both offline and online experiments confirm that this attack significantly reduces RAG performance without requiring internal access. Furthermore, from an insider perspective within the RAG system, we propose a re-ranking method that acts as a fundamental safeguard, offering minimal protection against unforeseen attacks.</p></details> |  |

Different from traditional RAG methods that mostly deal with flat text chunks, the proposed method takes into account the relationship of multimodalities by using a graph structure. To do that, a graph modeling structure is defined based on document layout parsing. The structure of an input document is retained with the connection of text chunks, tables, and figures. This representation allows the method to handle complex questions that require information from multimodalities. To confirm the efficiency of the graph modeling, a flexible RAG pipeline is developed using robust components. Experimental results on four benchmark test sets confirm the contribution of the layout-aware modeling for performance improvement of the RAG pipeline.</p></details> | <details><summary>NAACL...</summary><p>NAACL 2025, Industry Track</p></details> |

Recent RAG advancements focus on improving retrieval outcomes through iterative LLM refinement or self-critique capabilities acquired through additional instruction tuning of LLMs. In this work, we introduce Speculative RAG - a framework that leverages a larger generalist LM to efficiently verify multiple RAG drafts produced in parallel by a smaller, distilled specialist LM. Each draft is generated from a distinct subset of retrieved documents, offering diverse perspectives on the evidence while reducing input token counts per draft. This approach enhances comprehension of each subset and mitigates potential position bias over long context. Our method accelerates RAG by delegating drafting to the smaller specialist LM, with the larger generalist LM performing a single verification pass over the drafts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Speculative RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance with reduced latency on TriviaQA, MuSiQue, PopQA, PubHealth, and ARC-Challenge benchmarks. It notably enhances accuracy by up to 12.97% while reducing latency by 50.83% compared to conventional RAG systems on PubHealth.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Biomedical code mapping identifies similarity or equivalence between concepts from different ontologies. Obtaining high-quality mapping usually relies on automatic generation of unrefined mapping with ontology domain fine-tuned language models (LMs), followed by manual selections or corrections by coding experts who have extensive domain expertise and familiarity with ontology schemas. The LMs usually provide unrefined code mapping suggestions as a list of candidates without reasoning or supporting evidence, hence coding experts still need to verify each suggested candidate against ontology sources to pick the best matches. This is also a recurring task as ontology sources are updated regularly to incorporate new research findings. Consequently, the need of regular LM retraining and manual refinement make code mapping time-consuming and labour intensive. In this work, we created OntologyRAG, an ontology-enhanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method that leverages the inductive biases from ontological knowledge graphs for in-context-learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs). Our solution grounds LLMs to knowledge graphs with unrefined mappings between ontologies and processes questions by generating an interpretable set of results that include prediction rational with mapping proximity assessment. Our solution doesn't require re-training LMs, as all ontology updates could be reflected by updating the knowledge graphs with a standard process. Evaluation results on a self-curated gold dataset show promises of using our method to enable coding experts to achieve better and faster code mapping.

| **[Faster, Cheaper, Better: Multi-Objective Hyperparameter Optimization for LLM and RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18635v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a popular technique for improving Large Language Model (LLM) systems, it introduces a large number of choices, parameters and hyperparameters that must be made or tuned. This includes the LLM, embedding, and ranker models themselves, as well as hyperparameters governing individual RAG components. Yet, collectively optimizing the entire configuration in a RAG or LLM system remains under-explored - especially in multi-objective settings - due to intractably large solution spaces, noisy objective evaluations, and the high cost of evaluations. In this work, we introduce the first approach for multi-objective parameter optimization of cost, latency, safety and alignment over entire LLM and RAG systems. We find that Bayesian optimization methods significantly outperform baseline approaches, obtaining a superior Pareto front on two new RAG benchmark tasks. We conclude our work with important considerations for practitioners who are designing multi-objective RAG systems, highlighting nuances such as how optimal configurations may not generalize across tasks and objectives.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ward: Provable RAG Dataset Inference via LLM Watermarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03537v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RAG enables LLMs to easily incorporate external data, raising concerns for data owners regarding unauthorized usage of their content. The challenge of detecting such unauthorized usage remains underexplored, with datasets and methods from adjacent fields being ill-suited for its study. We take several steps to bridge this gap. First, we formalize this problem as (black-box) RAG Dataset Inference (RAG-DI). We then introduce a novel dataset designed for realistic benchmarking of RAG-DI methods, alongside a set of baselines. Finally, we propose Ward, a method for RAG-DI based on LLM watermarks that equips data owners with rigorous statistical guarantees regarding their dataset's misuse in RAG corpora. Ward consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving higher accuracy, superior query efficiency and robustness. Our work provides a foundation for future studies of RAG-DI and highlights LLM watermarks as a promising approach to this problem.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[Towards Fair RAG: On the Impact of Fair Ranking in Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11598v3)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern language models frequently include retrieval components to improve their outputs, giving rise to a growing number of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. Yet, most existing work in RAG has underemphasized fair ranking techniques and neglected the diverse interests of all stakeholders. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of RAG systems that incorporate fairness-aware rankings, focusing on both ranking fairness and attribution fairness - ensuring equitable exposure of sources cited in the final text. We specifically examine item-side fairness, i.e., whether retrieved documents receive balanced exposure, and assess how this affects both the system's overall performance and the eventual distribution of cited sources. Across twelve RAG models and seven tasks, we find that fairness-aware retrieval frequently retains or even improves ranking effectiveness and generation quality, countering the widespread belief that fairness compromises system performance. Moreover, we show that fair retrieval leads to more balanced attribution in the final responses, ensuring that the cited sources are credited more equitably. Our results underscore the importance of item-side fairness throughout both retrieval and generation phases, offering key insights for building more responsible and equitable RAG systems and illustrating promising avenues for future exploration in fair ranking and source attribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Top 5...</summary><p>Top 5 Spotlight at AFME Workshop at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating the Effectiveness and Efficiency of Demonstration Retrievers in RAG for Coding Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09662v2)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge bases, achieving state-of-the-art results in various coding tasks. The core of RAG is retrieving demonstration examples, which is essential to balance effectiveness (generation quality) and efficiency (retrieval time) for optimal performance. However, the high-dimensional nature of code representations and large knowledge bases often create efficiency bottlenecks, which are overlooked in previous research. This paper systematically evaluates the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off of retrievers across three coding tasks: Program Synthesis, Commit Message Generation, and Assertion Generation. We examined six retrievers: two sparse (BM25 and BM25L) and four dense retrievers, including one exhaustive dense retriever (SBERT's Semantic Search) and three approximate dense retrievers (ANNOY, LSH, and HNSW). Our findings show that while BM25 excels in effectiveness, it suffers in efficiency as the knowledge base grows beyond 1000 entries. In large-scale retrieval, efficiency differences become more pronounced, with approximate dense retrievers offering the greatest gains. For instance, in Commit Generation task, HNSW achieves a 44x speed up, while only with a 1.74% drop in RougeL compared with BM25. Our results also show that increasing the number of demonstrations in the prompt doesn't always improve the effectiveness and can increase latency and lead to incorrect outputs. Our findings provide valuable insights for practitioners aiming to build efficient and effective RAG systems for coding tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables, accepted by SANER 2025</p></details> |
| **[Mitigating Bias in RAG: Controlling the Embedder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17390v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems, each individual component -- the LLM, embedder, and corpus -- could introduce biases in the form of skews towards outputting certain perspectives or identities. In this work, we study the conflict between biases of each component and their relationship to the overall bias of the RAG system, which we call bias conflict. Examining both gender and political biases as case studies, we show that bias conflict can be characterized through a linear relationship among components despite its complexity in 6 different LLMs. Through comprehensive fine-tuning experiments creating 120 differently biased embedders, we demonstrate how to control bias while maintaining utility and reveal the importance of reverse-biasing the embedder to mitigate bias in the overall system. Additionally, we find that LLMs and tasks exhibit varying sensitivities to the embedder bias, a crucial factor to consider for debiasing. Our results underscore that a fair RAG system can be better achieved by carefully controlling the bias of the embedder rather than increasing its fairness.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages (8 main), 12 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[LettuceDetect: A Hallucination Detection Framework for RAG Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17125v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems remain vulnerable to hallucinated answers despite incorporating external knowledge sources. We present LettuceDetect a framework that addresses two critical limitations in existing hallucination detection methods: (1) the context window constraints of traditional encoder-based methods, and (2) the computational inefficiency of LLM based approaches. Building on ModernBERT's extended context capabilities (up to 8k tokens) and trained on the RAGTruth benchmark dataset, our approach outperforms all previous encoder-based models and most prompt-based models, while being approximately 30 times smaller than the best models. LettuceDetect is a token-classification model that processes context-question-answer triples, allowing for the identification of unsupported claims at the token level. Evaluations on the RAGTruth corpus demonstrate an F1 score of 79.22% for example-level detection, which is a 14.8% improvement over Luna, the previous state-of-the-art encoder-based architecture. Additionally, the system can process 30 to 60 examples per second on a single GPU, making it more practical for real-world RAG applications.</p></details> | 6 pages |
