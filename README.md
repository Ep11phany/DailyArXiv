| **[Do Multimodal Large Language Models See Like Humans?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09603v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive results on various vision tasks, leveraging recent advancements in large language models. However, a critical question remains unaddressed: do MLLMs perceive visual information similarly to humans? Current benchmarks lack the ability to evaluate MLLMs from this perspective. To address this challenge, we introduce HVSBench, a large-scale benchmark designed to assess the alignment between MLLMs and the human visual system (HVS) on fundamental vision tasks that mirror human vision. HVSBench curated over 85K multimodal samples, spanning 13 categories and 5 fields in HVS, including Prominence, Subitizing, Prioritizing, Free-Viewing, and Searching. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark in providing a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs. Specifically, we evaluate 13 MLLMs, revealing that even the best models show significant room for improvement, with most achieving only moderate results. Our experiments reveal that HVSBench presents a new and significant challenge for cutting-edge MLLMs. Diverse human participants attained strong performance, significantly outperforming MLLMs, which further underscores the benchmark's high quality. We believe that HVSBench will facilitate research on human-aligned and explainable MLLMs, marking a key step in understanding how MLLMs perceive and process visual information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://jiaying.link/HVSBench/</p></details> |
| **[Video-R1: Reinforcing Video Reasoning in MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21776v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by DeepSeek-R1's success in eliciting reasoning abilities through rule-based reinforcement learning (RL), we introduce Video-R1 as the first attempt to systematically explore the R1 paradigm for eliciting video reasoning within multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, directly applying RL training with the GRPO algorithm to video reasoning presents two primary challenges: (i) a lack of temporal modeling for video reasoning, and (ii) the scarcity of high-quality video-reasoning data. To address these issues, we first propose the T-GRPO algorithm, which encourages models to utilize temporal information in videos for reasoning. Additionally, instead of relying solely on video data, we incorporate high-quality image-reasoning data into the training process. We have constructed two datasets: Video-R1-COT-165k for SFT cold start and Video-R1-260k for RL training, both comprising image and video data. Experimental results demonstrate that Video-R1 achieves significant improvements on video reasoning benchmarks such as VideoMMMU and VSI-Bench, as well as on general video benchmarks including MVBench and TempCompass, etc. Notably, Video-R1-7B attains a 35.8% accuracy on video spatial reasoning benchmark VSI-bench, surpassing the commercial proprietary model GPT-4o. All codes, models, data are released.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/tulerfeng/Video-R1</p></details> |
| **[GenoTEX: A Benchmark for Automated Gene Expression Data Analysis in Alignment with Bioinformaticians](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15341v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in machine learning have significantly improved the identification of disease-associated genes from gene expression datasets. However, these processes often require extensive expertise and manual effort, limiting their scalability. Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown promise in automating these tasks due to their increasing problem-solving abilities. To support the evaluation and development of such methods, we introduce GenoTEX, a benchmark dataset for the automated analysis of gene expression data. GenoTEX provides annotated code and results for solving a wide range of gene identification problems, encompassing dataset selection, preprocessing, and statistical analysis, in a pipeline that follows computational genomics standards. The benchmark includes expert-curated annotations from bioinformaticians to ensure accuracy and reliability. To provide baselines for these tasks, we present GenoAgent, a team of LLM-based agents that adopt a multi-step programming workflow with flexible self-correction, to collaboratively analyze gene expression datasets. Our experiments demonstrate the potential of LLM-based methods in analyzing genomic data, while error analysis highlights the challenges and areas for future improvement. We propose GenoTEX as a promising resource for benchmarking and enhancing automated methods for gene expression data analysis. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/Liu-Hy/GenoTex.</p></details> | 29 pages, 3 figures |
| **[MemInsight: Autonomous Memory Augmentation for LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21760v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents have evolved to intelligently process information, make decisions, and interact with users or tools. A key capability is the integration of long-term memory capabilities, enabling these agents to draw upon historical interactions and knowledge. However, the growing memory size and need for semantic structuring pose significant challenges. In this work, we propose an autonomous memory augmentation approach, MemInsight, to enhance semantic data representation and retrieval mechanisms. By leveraging autonomous augmentation to historical interactions, LLM agents are shown to deliver more accurate and contextualized responses. We empirically validate the efficacy of our proposed approach in three task scenarios; conversational recommendation, question answering and event summarization. On the LLM-REDIAL dataset, MemInsight boosts persuasiveness of recommendations by up to 14%. Moreover, it outperforms a RAG baseline by 34% in recall for LoCoMo retrieval. Our empirical results show the potential of MemInsight to enhance the contextual performance of LLM agents across multiple tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[GateLens: A Reasoning-Enhanced LLM Agent for Automotive Software Release Analytics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21735v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the reliability and effectiveness of software release decisions is critical, particularly in safety-critical domains like automotive systems. Precise analysis of release validation data, often presented in tabular form, plays a pivotal role in this process. However, traditional methods that rely on manual analysis of extensive test datasets and validation metrics are prone to delays and high costs. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative but face challenges in analytical reasoning, contextual understanding, handling out-of-scope queries, and processing structured test data consistently; limitations that hinder their direct application in safety-critical scenarios. This paper introduces GateLens, an LLM-based tool for analyzing tabular data in the automotive domain. GateLens translates natural language queries into Relational Algebra (RA) expressions and then generates optimized Python code. It outperforms the baseline system on benchmarking datasets, achieving higher F1 scores and handling complex and ambiguous queries with greater robustness. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of the RA module, with performance dropping sharply when omitted. Industrial evaluations reveal that GateLens reduces analysis time by over 80% while maintaining high accuracy and reliability. As demonstrated by presented results, GateLens achieved high performance without relying on few-shot examples, showcasing strong generalization across various query types from diverse company roles. Insights from deploying GateLens with a partner automotive company offer practical guidance for integrating AI into critical workflows such as release validation. Results show that by automating test result analysis, GateLens enables faster, more informed, and dependable release decisions, and can thus advance software scalability and reliability in automotive systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reimagining Memory Access for LLM Inference: Compression-Aware Memory Controller Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18869v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The efficiency of Large Language Model~(LLM) inference is often constrained by substantial memory bandwidth and capacity demands. Existing techniques, such as pruning, quantization, and mixture of experts/depth, reduce memory capacity and/or bandwidth consumption at the cost of slight degradation in inference quality. This paper introduces a design solution that further alleviates memory bottlenecks by enhancing the on-chip memory controller in AI accelerators to achieve two main objectives: (1) significantly reducing memory capacity and bandwidth usage through lossless block compression~(e.g., LZ4 and ZSTD) of model weights and key-value (KV) cache without compromising inference quality, and (2) enabling memory bandwidth and energy consumption to scale proportionally with context-dependent dynamic quantization. These goals are accomplished by equipping the on-chip memory controller with mechanisms to improve fine-grained bit-level accessibility and compressibility of weights and KV cache through LLM-aware configuration of in-memory placement and representation. Experimental results on publicly available LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, showing memory footprint reductions of 25.2\% for model weights and 46.9\% for KV cache. In addition, our hardware prototype at 4\,GHz and 32 lanes (7\,nm) achieves 8\,TB/s throughput with a modest area overhead (under 3.8\,mm\(^2\)), which underscores the viability of LLM-aware memory control as a key to efficient large-scale inference.</p></details> | 9 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Effective Skill Unlearning through Intervention and Abstention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21730v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable skills across various domains. Understanding the mechanisms behind their abilities and implementing controls over them is becoming increasingly important for developing better models. In this paper, we focus on skill unlearning in LLMs, specifically unlearning a particular skill while retaining their overall capabilities. We introduce two lightweight, training-free machine skill unlearning techniques for LLMs. First, we observe that the pre-activation distribution of neurons in each Feed-Forward Layer (FFL) differs when the model demonstrates different skills. Additionally, we find that queries triggering the same skill cluster within the FFL key space and can be separated from other queries using a hypercube. Based on these observations, we propose two lightweight, training-free skill unlearning methods via \textit{intervention} and \textit{abstention} respectively: \texttt{Neuron Adjust} and \texttt{Key Space Detection}. We evaluate our methods on unlearning math-solving, Python-coding, and comprehension skills across seven different languages. The results demonstrate their strong unlearning capabilities for the designated skills. Specifically, \texttt{Key Space Detection} achieves over 80\% relative performance drop on the forgetting skill and less than 10\% relative performance drop on other skills and the model's general knowledge (MMLU) for most unlearning tasks.

| **[Multi-View and Multi-Scale Alignment for Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training in Mammography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18119v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) demonstrates strong potential in medical image analysis but requires substantial data and computational resources. Due to these restrictions, existing CLIP applications in medical imaging focus mainly on modalities like chest X-rays that have abundant image-report data available, leaving many other important modalities underexplored. Here, we propose one of the first adaptations of the full CLIP model to mammography, which presents significant challenges due to labeled data scarcity, high-resolution images with small regions of interest, and class-wise imbalance. We first develop a specialized supervision framework for mammography that leverages its multi-view nature. Furthermore, we design a symmetric local alignment module to better focus on detailed features in high-resolution images. Lastly, we incorporate a parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach for large language models pre-trained with medical knowledge to address data limitations. Our multi-view and multi-scale alignment (MaMA) method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for three different tasks on two large real-world mammography datasets, EMBED and RSNA-Mammo, with only 52% model size compared with the largest baseline. The code is available at https://github.com/XYPB/MaMA</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by IPMI 2025 for Oral Presentation</p></details> |
| **[Collab: Controlled Decoding using Mixture of Agents for LLM Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21720v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alignment of Large Language models (LLMs) is crucial for safe and trustworthy deployment in applications. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as an effective technique to align LLMs to human preferences and broader utilities, but it requires updating billions of model parameters, which is computationally expensive. Controlled Decoding, by contrast, provides a mechanism for aligning a model at inference time without retraining. However, single-agent decoding approaches often struggle to adapt to diverse tasks due to the complexity and variability inherent in these tasks. To strengthen the test-time performance w.r.t the target task, we propose a mixture of agent-based decoding strategies leveraging the existing off-the-shelf aligned LLM policies. Treating each prior policy as an agent in the spirit of mixture of agent collaboration, we develop a decoding method that allows for inference-time alignment through a token-level selection strategy among multiple agents. For each token, the most suitable LLM is dynamically chosen from a pool of models based on a long-term utility metric. This policy-switching mechanism ensures optimal model selection at each step, enabling efficient collaboration and alignment among LLMs during decoding. Theoretical analysis of our proposed algorithm establishes optimal performance with respect to the target task represented via a target reward for the given off-the-shelf models. We conduct comprehensive empirical evaluations with open-source aligned models on diverse tasks and preferences, which demonstrates the merits of this approach over single-agent decoding baselines. Notably, Collab surpasses the current SoTA decoding strategy, achieving an improvement of up to 1.56x in average reward and 71.89% in GPT-4 based win-tie rate.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[SlowFast-LLaVA-1.5: A Family of Token-Efficient Video Large Language Models for Long-Form Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18943v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce SlowFast-LLaVA-1.5 (abbreviated as SF-LLaVA-1.5), a family of video large language models (LLMs) offering a token-efficient solution for long-form video understanding. We incorporate the two-stream SlowFast mechanism into a streamlined training pipeline, and perform joint video-image training on a carefully curated data mixture of only publicly available datasets. Our primary focus is on highly efficient model scales (1B and 3B), demonstrating that even relatively small Video LLMs can achieve state-of-the-art performance on video understanding, meeting the demand for mobile-friendly models. Experimental results demonstrate that SF-LLaVA-1.5 achieves superior performance on a wide range of video and image tasks, with robust results at all model sizes (ranging from 1B to 7B). Notably, SF-LLaVA-1.5 achieves state-of-the-art results in long-form video understanding (e.g., LongVideoBench and MLVU) and excels at small scales across various video benchmarks.</p></details> | Technical report |
| **[Understanding the Logic of Direct Preference Alignment through Logic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17696v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent direct preference alignment algorithms (DPA), such as DPO, have shown great promise in aligning large language models to human preferences. While this has motivated the development of many new variants of the original DPO loss, understanding the differences between these recent proposals, as well as developing new DPA loss functions, remains difficult given the lack of a technical and conceptual framework for reasoning about the underlying semantics of these algorithms. In this paper, we attempt to remedy this by formalizing DPA losses in terms of discrete reasoning problems. Specifically, we ask: Given an existing DPA loss, can we systematically derive a symbolic program that characterizes its semantics? We propose a novel formalism for characterizing preference losses for single model and reference model based approaches, and identify symbolic forms for a number of commonly used DPA variants. Further, we show how this formal view of preference learning sheds new light on both the size and structure of the DPA loss landscape, making it possible to not only rigorously characterize the relationships between recent loss proposals but also to systematically explore the landscape and derive new loss functions from first principles. We hope our framework and findings will help provide useful guidance to those working on human AI alignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Repository-Level Software Repair via Repository-Aware Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21710v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Repository-level software repair faces challenges in bridging semantic gaps between issue descriptions and code patches. Existing approaches, which mostly depend on large language models (LLMs), suffer from semantic ambiguities, limited structural context understanding, and insufficient reasoning capability. To address these limitations, we propose KGCompass with two innovations: (1) a novel repository-aware knowledge graph (KG) that accurately links repository artifacts (issues and pull requests) and codebase entities (files, classes, and functions), allowing us to effectively narrow down the vast search space to only 20 most relevant functions with accurate candidate bug locations and contextual information, and (2) a path-guided repair mechanism that leverages KG-mined entity path, tracing through which allows us to augment LLMs with relevant contextual information to generate precise patches along with their explanations. Experimental results in the SWE-Bench-Lite demonstrate that KGCompass achieves state-of-the-art repair performance (45.67%) and function-level localization accuracy (51.33%) across open-source approaches, costing only $0.20 per repair. Our analysis reveals that among successfully localized bugs, 69.7% require multi-hop traversals through the knowledge graph, without which LLM-based approaches struggle to accurately locate bugs. The knowledge graph built in KGCompass is language agnostic and can be incrementally updated, making it a practical solution for real-world development environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Gomoku: A Large Language Model-Based System for Strategic Gomoku with Self-Play and Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21683v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have shown significant advancements in natural language processing (NLP), with strong capa-bilities in generation, comprehension, and rea-soning. These models have found applications in education, intelligent decision-making, and gaming. However, effectively utilizing LLMs for strategic planning and decision-making in the game of Gomoku remains a challenge. This study aims to develop a Gomoku AI system based on LLMs, simulating the human learning process of playing chess. The system is de-signed to understand and apply Gomoku strat-egies and logic to make rational decisions. The research methods include enabling the model to "read the board," "understand the rules," "select strategies," and "evaluate positions," while en-hancing its abilities through self-play and rein-forcement learning. The results demonstrate that this approach significantly improves the se-lection of move positions, resolves the issue of generating illegal positions, and reduces pro-cess time through parallel position evaluation. After extensive self-play training, the model's Gomoku-playing capabilities have been notably enhanced.</p></details> |  |
| **[JiraiBench: A Bilingual Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models' Detection of Human Self-Destructive Behavior Content in Jirai Community](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21679v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces JiraiBench, the first bilingual benchmark for evaluating large language models' effectiveness in detecting self-destructive content across Chinese and Japanese social media communities. Focusing on the transnational "Jirai" (landmine) online subculture that encompasses multiple forms of self-destructive behaviors including drug overdose, eating disorders, and self-harm, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework incorporating both linguistic and cultural dimensions. Our dataset comprises 10,419 Chinese posts and 5,000 Japanese posts with multidimensional annotation along three behavioral categories, achieving substantial inter-annotator agreement. Experimental evaluations across four state-of-the-art models reveal significant performance variations based on instructional language, with Japanese prompts unexpectedly outperforming Chinese prompts when processing Chinese content. This emergent cross-cultural transfer suggests that cultural proximity can sometimes outweigh linguistic similarity in detection tasks. Cross-lingual transfer experiments with fine-tuned models further demonstrate the potential for knowledge transfer between these language systems without explicit target language training. These findings highlight the need for culturally-informed approaches to multilingual content moderation and provide empirical evidence for the importance of cultural context in developing more effective detection systems for vulnerable online communities.</p></details> | 20 pages, 1 figures |
| **[How do language models learn facts? Dynamics, curricula and hallucinations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21676v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models accumulate vast knowledge during pre-training, yet the dynamics governing this acquisition remain poorly understood. This work investigates the learning dynamics of language models on a synthetic factual recall task, uncovering three key findings: First, language models learn in three phases, exhibiting a performance plateau before acquiring precise factual knowledge. Mechanistically, this plateau coincides with the formation of attention-based circuits that support recall. Second, the training data distribution significantly impacts learning dynamics, as imbalanced distributions lead to shorter plateaus. Finally, hallucinations emerge simultaneously with knowledge, and integrating new knowledge into the model through fine-tuning is challenging, as it quickly corrupts its existing parametric memories. Our results emphasize the importance of data distribution in knowledge acquisition and suggest novel data scheduling strategies to accelerate neural network training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intelligent IoT Attack Detection Design via ODLLM with Feature Ranking-based Knowledge Base](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21674v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has introduced significant cybersecurity challenges, particularly with the increasing frequency and sophistication of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Traditional machine learning (ML) techniques often fall short in detecting such attacks due to the complexity of blended and evolving patterns. To address this, we propose a novel framework leveraging On-Device Large Language Models (ODLLMs) augmented with fine-tuning and knowledge base (KB) integration for intelligent IoT network attack detection. By implementing feature ranking techniques and constructing both long and short KBs tailored to model capacities, the proposed framework ensures efficient and accurate detection of DDoS attacks while overcoming computational and privacy limitations. Simulation results demonstrate that the optimized framework achieves superior accuracy across diverse attack types, especially when using compact models in edge computing environments. This work provides a scalable and secure solution for real-time IoT security, advancing the applicability of edge intelligence in cybersecurity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating Antibiotic Discovery with Large Language Models and Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16655v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discovery of novel antibiotics is critical to address the growing antimicrobial resistance (AMR). However, pharmaceutical industries face high costs (over $1 billion), long timelines, and a high failure rate, worsened by the rediscovery of known compounds. We propose an LLM-based pipeline that acts as an alarm system, detecting prior evidence of antibiotic activity to prevent costly rediscoveries. The system integrates organism and chemical literature into a Knowledge Graph (KG), ensuring taxonomic resolution, synonym handling, and multi-level evidence classification. We tested the pipeline on a private list of 73 potential antibiotic-producing organisms, disclosing 12 negative hits for evaluation. The results highlight the effectiveness of the pipeline for evidence reviewing, reducing false negatives, and accelerating decision-making. The KG for negative hits and the user interface for interactive exploration will be made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables fix: table, typos and error analysis</p></details> |
| **[OmniBench: Towards The Future of Universal Omni-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15272v4)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have focused on integrating multiple modalities, yet their ability to simultaneously process and reason across different inputs remains underexplored. We introduce OmniBench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate models' ability to recognize, interpret, and reason across visual, acoustic, and textual inputs simultaneously. We define language models capable of such tri-modal processing as omni-language models (OLMs). OmniBench features high-quality human annotations that require integrated understanding across all modalities. Our evaluation reveals that: i) open-source OLMs show significant limitations in instruction-following and reasoning in tri-modal contexts; and ii) most baseline models perform poorly (around 50% accuracy) even with textual alternatives to image/audio inputs. To address these limitations, we develop OmniInstruct, an 96K-sample instruction tuning dataset for training OLMs. We advocate for developing more robust tri-modal integration techniques and training strategies to enhance OLM performance. Codes and data could be found at our repo (https://github.com/multimodal-art-projection/OmniBench).</p></details> |  |
| **[CleanGen: Mitigating Backdoor Attacks for Generation Tasks in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12257v3)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable performance of large language models (LLMs) in generation tasks has enabled practitioners to leverage publicly available models to power custom applications, such as chatbots and virtual assistants. However, the data used to train or fine-tune these LLMs is often undisclosed, allowing an attacker to compromise the data and inject backdoors into the models. In this paper, we develop a novel inference time defense, named CLEANGEN, to mitigate backdoor attacks for generation tasks in LLMs. CLEANGEN is a lightweight and effective decoding strategy that is compatible with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs. Our insight behind CLEANGEN is that compared to other LLMs, backdoored LLMs assign significantly higher probabilities to tokens representing the attacker-desired contents. These discrepancies in token probabilities enable CLEANGEN to identify suspicious tokens favored by the attacker and replace them with tokens generated by another LLM that is not compromised by the same attacker, thereby avoiding generation of attacker-desired content. We evaluate CLEANGEN against five SOTA backdoor attacks. Our results show that CLEANGEN achieves lower attack success rates (ASR) compared to five SOTA baseline defenses for all five backdoor attacks. Moreover, LLMs deploying CLEANGEN maintain helpfulness in their responses when serving benign user queries with minimal added computational overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is presented at EMNLP 2024</p></details> |

Specifically, on BlindTest, our suite of 7 very simple tasks, including identifying (a) whether two circles overlap; (b) how many times two lines intersect; (c) which letter is being circled in a word; and (d) the number of circles in an Olympic-like logo, four state-of-the-art VLMs are only 58.07% accurate on average. Claude 3.5 Sonnet performs the best at 77.84% accuracy, far from the human expected accuracy of 100%. Across different image resolutions and line widths, VLMs including slow-thinking models consistently struggle with those tasks that require precise spatial information when geometric primitives overlap or are close. Yet, VLMs perform at near-100% accuracy when much more space is added to separate shapes and letters. Linear probing experiments show that vision encoders contain sufficient visual information to solve BlindTest and that language models fail to decode this information into correct answers. Code and data are at: https://vlmsareblind.github.io</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing LLM Character-Level Manipulation via Divide and Conquer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08180v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization capabilities across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, they exhibit notable weaknesses in character-level string manipulation, struggling with fundamental operations such as character deletion, insertion, and substitution. These challenges stem primarily from tokenization constraints, despite the critical role of such operations in data preprocessing and code generation. Through systematic analysis, we derive two key insights: (1) LLMs face significant difficulties in leveraging intrinsic token knowledge for character-level reasoning, and (2) atomized word structures can substantially enhance LLMs' ability to process token-level structural information. Building on these insights, we propose Character-Level Manipulation via Divide and Conquer, a novel approach designed to bridge the gap between token-level processing and character-level manipulation. Our method decomposes complex operations into explicit character-level subtasks coupled with controlled token reconstruction phases, leading to significant improvements in accuracy. Without additional training, our method significantly improves accuracies on the $\texttt{Deletion}$, $\texttt{Insertion}$, and $\texttt{Substitution}$ tasks. To support further research, we open-source our implementation and benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[UI-R1: Enhancing Action Prediction of GUI Agents by Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21620v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent DeepSeek-R1 has showcased the emergence of reasoning capabilities in LLMs through reinforcement learning (RL) with rule-based rewards. Building on this idea, we are the first to explore how rule-based RL can enhance the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for graphic user interface (GUI) action prediction tasks. To this end, we curate a small yet high-quality dataset of 136 challenging tasks, encompassing five common action types on mobile devices. We also introduce a unified rule-based action reward, enabling model optimization via policy-based algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed data-efficient model, UI-R1-3B, achieves substantial improvements on both in-domain (ID) and out-of-domain (OOD) tasks. Specifically, on the ID benchmark AndroidControl, the action type accuracy improves by 15%, while grounding accuracy increases by 10.3%, compared with the base model (i.e. Qwen2.5-VL-3B). On the OOD GUI grounding benchmark ScreenSpot-Pro, our model surpasses the base model by 6.0% and achieves competitive performance with larger models (e.g., OS-Atlas-7B), which are trained via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on 76K data. These results underscore the potential of rule-based reinforcement learning to advance GUI understanding and control, paving the way for future research in this domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating book summaries from internal knowledge in Large Language Models: a cross-model and semantic consistency approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21613v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the ability of large language models (LLMs) to generate comprehensive and accurate book summaries solely from their internal knowledge, without recourse to the original text. Employing a diverse set of books and multiple LLM architectures, we examine whether these models can synthesize meaningful narratives that align with established human interpretations. Evaluation is performed with a LLM-as-a-judge paradigm: each AI-generated summary is compared against a high-quality, human-written summary via a cross-model assessment, where all participating LLMs evaluate not only their own outputs but also those produced by others. This methodology enables the identification of potential biases, such as the proclivity for models to favor their own summarization style over others. In addition, alignment between the human-crafted and LLM-generated summaries is quantified using ROUGE and BERTScore metrics, assessing the depth of grammatical and semantic correspondence. The results reveal nuanced variations in content representation and stylistic preferences among the models, highlighting both strengths and limitations inherent in relying on internal knowledge for summarization tasks. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of LLM internal encodings of factual information and the dynamics of cross-model evaluation, with implications for the development of more robust natural language generative systems.</p></details> | 22 pages, 6 figures |

Despite these advancements, enterprise deployments remain challenging due to the need to capture business-specific knowledge, handle complex queries, and meet expectations of continuous improvements. To address these issues, we designed and implemented GenEdit: our Text-to-SQL generation system that improves with user feedback. GenEdit builds and maintains a company-specific knowledge set, employs a pipeline of operators decomposing SQL generation, and uses feedback to update its knowledge set to improve future SQL generations. We describe GenEdit's architecture made of two core modules: (i) decomposed SQL generation; and (ii) knowledge set edits based on user feedback. For generation, GenEdit leverages compounding operators to improve knowledge retrieval and to create a plan as chain-of-thought steps that guides generation. GenEdit first retrieves relevant examples in an initial retrieval stage where original SQL queries are decomposed into sub-statements, clauses or sub-queries. It then also retrieves instructions and schema elements. Using the retrieved contextual information, GenEdit then generates step-by-step plan in natural language on how to produce the query. Finally, GenEdit uses the plan to generate SQL, minimizing the need for model reasoning, which enhances complex SQL generation. If necessary, GenEdit regenerates the query based on syntactic and semantic errors. The knowledge set edits are recommended through an interactive copilot, allowing users to iterate on their feedback and to regenerate SQL queries as needed. Each generation uses staged edits which update the generation prompt. Once the feedback is submitted, it gets merged after passing regression testing and obtaining an approval, improving future generations.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a novel jailbreaking framework that employs distributed prompt processing combined with iterative refinements to bypass these safety measures, particularly in generating malicious code. Our architecture consists of four key modules: prompt segmentation, parallel processing, response aggregation, and LLM-based jury evaluation. Tested on 500 malicious prompts across 10 cybersecurity categories, the framework achieves a 73.2% Success Rate (SR) in generating malicious code. Notably, our comparative analysis reveals that traditional single-LLM judge evaluation overestimates SRs (93.8%) compared to our LLM jury system (73.2%), with manual verification confirming that single-judge assessments often accept incomplete implementations. Moreover, we demonstrate that our distributed architecture improves SRs by 12% over the non-distributed approach in an ablation study, highlighting both the effectiveness of distributed prompt processing and the importance of robust evaluation methodologies in assessing jailbreak attempts.</p></details> | 22 pages; 26 figures |
| **[Cooking Task Planning using LLM and Verified by Graph Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21564v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cooking tasks remain a challenging problem for robotics due to their complexity. Videos of people cooking are a valuable source of information for such task, but introduces a lot of variability in terms of how to translate this data to a robotic environment. This research aims to streamline this process, focusing on the task plan generation step, by using a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) framework to autonomously generate cooking task plans from videos with subtitles, and execute them. Conventional LLM-based task planning methods are not well-suited for interpreting the cooking video data due to uncertainty in the videos, and the risk of hallucination in its output. To address both of these problems, we explore using LLMs in combination with Functional Object-Oriented Networks (FOON), to validate the plan and provide feedback in case of failure. This combination can generate task sequences with manipulation motions that are logically correct and executable by a robot. We compare the execution of the generated plans for 5 cooking recipes from our approach against the plans generated by a few-shot LLM-only approach for a dual-arm robot setup. It could successfully execute 4 of the plans generated by our approach, whereas only 1 of the plans generated by solely using the LLM could be executed.</p></details> |  |

We posit that LLMs can benefit from the ability to interactively explore a codebase to gather the information relevant to their task. To achieve this, we present a textual environment, namely debug-gym, for developing LLM-based agents in an interactive coding setting. Our environment is lightweight and provides a preset of useful tools, such as a Python debugger (pdb), designed to facilitate an LLM-based agent's interactive debugging. Beyond coding and debugging tasks, this approach can be generalized to other tasks that would benefit from information-seeking behavior by an LLM agent.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces the concept of Speaking with Intent (SWI) in large language models (LLMs), where the explicitly generated intent encapsulates the model's underlying intention and provides high-level planning to guide subsequent analysis and communication. By emulating deliberate and purposeful thoughts in the human mind, SWI is hypothesized to enhance the reasoning capabilities and generation quality of LLMs. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks consistently demonstrate the superiority of Speaking with Intent over Baseline (i.e., generation without explicit intent). Moreover, SWI outperforms answer-trigger prompting methods Chain-of-Thought and Plan-and-Solve and maintains competitive performance with the strong method ARR (Analyzing, Retrieving, and Reasoning). Additionally, the effectiveness and generalizability of SWI are solidified on reasoning-intensive question answering (QA) and text summarization benchmarks, where SWI brings consistent improvement to the Baseline generation. In text summarization, SWI-generated summaries exhibit greater accuracy, conciseness, and factual correctness, with fewer hallucinations. Furthermore, human evaluations verify the coherence, effectiveness, and interpretability of the intent produced by SWI. This proof-of-concept study creates a novel avenue for enhancing LLMs' reasoning abilities with cognitive notions.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages.

| **[Combining Artificial Users and Psychotherapist Assessment to Evaluate Large Language Model-based Mental Health Chatbots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21540v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to overcome limitations of rule-based mental health chatbots through more natural conversations. However, evaluating LLM-based mental health chatbots presents a significant challenge: Their probabilistic nature requires comprehensive testing to ensure therapeutic quality, yet conducting such evaluations with people with depression would impose an additional burden on vulnerable people and risk exposing them to potentially harmful content. Our paper presents an evaluation approach for LLM-based mental health chatbots that combines dialogue generation with artificial users and dialogue evaluation by psychotherapists. We developed artificial users based on patient vignettes, systematically varying characteristics such as depression severity, personality traits, and attitudes toward chatbots, and let them interact with a LLM-based behavioral activation chatbot. Ten psychotherapists evaluated 48 randomly selected dialogues using standardized rating scales to assess the quality of behavioral activation and its therapeutic capabilities. We found that while artificial users showed moderate authenticity, they enabled comprehensive testing across different users. In addition, the chatbot demonstrated promising capabilities in delivering behavioral activation and maintaining safety. Furthermore, we identified deficits, such as ensuring the appropriateness of the activity plan, which reveals necessary improvements for the chatbot. Our framework provides an effective method for evaluating LLM-based mental health chatbots while protecting vulnerable people during the evaluation process. Future research should improve the authenticity of artificial users and develop LLM-augmented evaluation tools to make psychotherapist evaluation more efficient, and thus further advance the evaluation of LLM-based mental health chatbots.</p></details> |  |

However, its substantial GPU memory consumption makes KV cache compression a key technique for enabling efficient LLM inference in industrial scenarios. While recent studies have focused on optimizing the memory occupied by the KV cache, they overlook two critical factors: preserving semantic coherence and considering task-specific characteristic during compression. To address these limitations, we propose a novel task-adaptive KV cache window selection method, WindowKV. WindowKV dynamically selects local semantic windows consisting of consecutive tokens, according to task-specific characteristics, ensuring the retained KV cache captures continuous, essential context. Additionally, we introduce an intra-group layer KV cache indices sharing strategy to reduce computational overhead, achieving a balance between performance and efficiency. We rigorously evaluate WindowKV on the LongBench benchmark, and the results demonstrate that it maintains a performance comparable to full KV cache retention while using only 12% of the original KV cache, significantly reducing memory requirements. Furthermore, our method also achieves state-of-the-art results in the Needle-in-a-Haystack evaluation, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> |  |

While existing methods are primarily text-based, the rise of social media highlights the need for multimodal analysis, incorporating text, images, and audio. However, the lack of multimodal datasets for euphemisms limits further research. To address this, we regard euphemisms and their corresponding target keywords as keywords and first introduce a keyword-oriented multimodal corpus of euphemisms (KOM-Euph), involving three datasets (Drug, Weapon, and Sexuality), including text, images, and speech. We further propose a keyword-oriented multimodal euphemism identification method (KOM-EI), which uses cross-modal feature alignment and dynamic fusion modules to explicitly utilize the visual and audio features of the keywords for efficient euphemism identification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KOM-EI outperforms state-of-the-art models and large language models, and show the importance of our multimodal datasets.</p></details> |  |

OpenHuEval is constructed from a vast collection of Hungarian-specific materials sourced from multiple origins. In the construction, we incorporated the latest design principles for evaluating LLMs, such as using real user queries from the internet, emphasizing the assessment of LLMs' generative capabilities, and employing LLM-as-judge to enhance the multidimensionality and accuracy of evaluations. Ultimately, OpenHuEval encompasses eight Hungarian-specific dimensions, featuring five tasks and 3953 questions. Consequently, OpenHuEval provides the comprehensive, in-depth, and scientifically accurate assessment of LLM performance in the context of the Hungarian language and its specifics. We evaluated current mainstream LLMs, including both traditional LLMs and recently developed Large Reasoning Models. The results demonstrate the significant necessity for evaluation and model optimization tailored to the Hungarian language and specifics. We also established the framework for analyzing the thinking processes of LRMs with OpenHuEval, revealing intrinsic patterns and mechanisms of these models in non-English languages, with Hungarian serving as a representative example. We will release OpenHuEval at https://github.com/opendatalab/OpenHuEval .</p></details> |  |

We present OmniVox, the first systematic evaluation of four omni-LLMs on the zero-shot emotion recognition task. We evaluate on two widely used multimodal emotion benchmarks: IEMOCAP and MELD, and find zero-shot omni-LLMs outperform or are competitive with fine-tuned audio models. Alongside our audio-only evaluation, we also evaluate omni-LLMs on text only and text and audio. We present acoustic prompting, an audio-specific prompting strategy for omni-LLMs which focuses on acoustic feature analysis, conversation context analysis, and step-by-step reasoning. We compare our acoustic prompting to minimal prompting and full chain-of-thought prompting techniques. We perform a context window analysis on IEMOCAP and MELD, and find that using context helps, especially on IEMOCAP. We conclude with an error analysis on the generated acoustic reasoning outputs from the omni-LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to COLM 2025.

By setting thresholds based on the number of thoughts, this metric can discern the difficulty of prompts and support more effective prompt routing. A 2% decrease in latency is achieved when routing prompts from the MathInstruct dataset through quantized, distilled versions of Deepseek with 1.7 billion, 7 billion, and 14 billion parameters. Moreover, this metric can be used to detect adversarial prompts used in prompt injection attacks with high efficacy. The Number of Thoughts can inform a classifier that achieves 95% accuracy in adversarial prompt detection.

However, effectively evaluating these MLLMs on face perception remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce FaceBench, a dataset featuring hierarchical multi-view and multi-level attributes specifically designed to assess the comprehensive face perception abilities of MLLMs. Initially, we construct a hierarchical facial attribute structure, which encompasses five views with up to three levels of attributes, totaling over 210 attributes and 700 attribute values. Based on the structure, the proposed FaceBench consists of 49,919 visual question-answering (VQA) pairs for evaluation and 23,841 pairs for fine-tuning. Moreover, we further develop a robust face perception MLLM baseline, Face-LLaVA, by training with our proposed face VQA data. Extensive experiments on various mainstream MLLMs and Face-LLaVA are conducted to test their face perception ability, with results also compared against human performance. The results reveal that, the existing MLLMs are far from satisfactory in understanding the fine-grained facial attributes, while our Face-LLaVA significantly outperforms existing open-source models with a small amount of training data and is comparable to commercial ones like GPT-4o and Gemini. The dataset will be released at https://github.com/CVI-SZU/FaceBench.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |

Recent advances in deep learning and large language models (LLMs) for quant finance have improved predictive modeling and enabled agent-based automation, suggesting a potential paradigm shift in this field. In this survey, taking alpha strategy as a representative example, we explore how AI contributes to the quantitative investment pipeline. We first examine the early stage of quant research, centered on human-crafted features and traditional statistical models with an established alpha pipeline. We then discuss the rise of deep learning, which enabled scalable modeling across the entire pipeline from data processing to order execution. Building on this, we highlight the emerging role of LLMs in extending AI beyond prediction, empowering autonomous agents to process unstructured data, generate alphas, and support self-iterative workflows.</p></details> |  |

Initially inspired by human neurons and their connections, NNs have become the foundation of AI models for many advanced architectures. However, some of the most integral processes in the human brain, particularly neurogenesis and neuroplasticity in addition to the more spread neuroapoptosis have largely been ignored in DNN architecture design. Instead, contemporary AI development predominantly focuses on constructing advanced frameworks, such as large language models, which retain a static structure of neural connections during training and inference. In this light, we explore how neurogenesis, neuroapoptosis, and neuroplasticity can inspire future AI advances. Specifically, we examine analogous activities in artificial NNs, introducing the concepts of ``dropin'' for neurogenesis and revisiting ``dropout'' and structural pruning for neuroapoptosis. We additionally suggest neuroplasticity combining the two for future large NNs in ``life-long learning'' settings following the biological inspiration. We conclude by advocating for greater research efforts in this interdisciplinary domain and identifying promising directions for future exploration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring the Roles of Large Language Models in Reshaping Transportation Systems: A Survey, Framework, and Roadmap](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21411v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern transportation systems face pressing challenges due to increasing demand, dynamic environments, and heterogeneous information integration. The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers transformative potential to address these challenges. Extensive knowledge and high-level capabilities derived from pretraining evolve the default role of LLMs as text generators to become versatile, knowledge-driven task solvers for intelligent transportation systems. This survey first presents LLM4TR, a novel conceptual framework that systematically categorizes the roles of LLMs in transportation into four synergetic dimensions: information processors, knowledge encoders, component generators, and decision facilitators. Through a unified taxonomy, we systematically elucidate how LLMs bridge fragmented data pipelines, enhance predictive analytics, simulate human-like reasoning, and enable closed-loop interactions across sensing, learning, modeling, and managing tasks in transportation systems. For each role, our review spans diverse applications, from traffic prediction and autonomous driving to safety analytics and urban mobility optimization, highlighting how emergent capabilities of LLMs such as in-context learning and step-by-step reasoning can enhance the operation and management of transportation systems. We further curate practical guidance, including available resources and computational guidelines, to support real-world deployment. By identifying challenges in existing LLM-based solutions, this survey charts a roadmap for advancing LLM-driven transportation research, positioning LLMs as central actors in the next generation of cyber-physical-social mobility ecosystems.

| **[VALLR: Visual ASR Language Model for Lip Reading](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21408v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lip Reading, or Visual Automatic Speech Recognition (V-ASR), is a complex task requiring the interpretation of spoken language exclusively from visual cues, primarily lip movements and facial expressions. This task is especially challenging due to the absence of auditory information and the inherent ambiguity when visually distinguishing phonemes that have overlapping visemes where different phonemes appear identical on the lips. Current methods typically attempt to predict words or characters directly from these visual cues, but this approach frequently encounters high error rates due to coarticulation effects and viseme ambiguity. We propose a novel two-stage, phoneme-centric framework for Visual Automatic Speech Recognition (V-ASR) that addresses these longstanding challenges. First, our model predicts a compact sequence of phonemes from visual inputs using a Video Transformer with a CTC head, thereby reducing the task complexity and achieving robust speaker invariance. This phoneme output then serves as the input to a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM), which reconstructs coherent words and sentences by leveraging broader linguistic context. Unlike existing methods that either predict words directly-often faltering on visually similar phonemes-or rely on large-scale multimodal pre-training, our approach explicitly encodes intermediate linguistic structure while remaining highly data efficient. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on two challenging datasets, LRS2 and LRS3, where our method achieves significant reductions in Word Error Rate (WER) achieving a SOTA WER of 18.7 on LRS3 despite using 99.4% less labelled data than the next best approach.</p></details> |  |

Data-driven predictive methods, especially those utilizing machine learning techniques, have emerged to handle these complexities in urban delivery demand management problems. One particularly pressing issue that has yet to be sufficiently addressed is the joint estimation and prediction of city-wide delivery demand, as well as the generalization of the model to new cities. To this end, we formulate this problem as a transferable graph-based spatiotemporal learning task. First, an individual-collective message-passing neural network model is formalized to capture the interaction between demand patterns of associated regions. Second, by exploiting recent advances in large language models (LLMs), we extract general geospatial knowledge encodings from the unstructured locational data using the embedding generated by LLMs. Last, to encourage the cross-city generalization of the model, we integrate the encoding into the demand predictor in a transferable way. Comprehensive empirical evaluation results on two real-world delivery datasets, including eight cities in China and the US, demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in accuracy, efficiency, and transferability.</p></details> |  |

There has been limited study about the assessment of the quality of translations generated by LLMs, including Gemini, GPT and Google Translate. In this study, we address this limitation by using semantic and sentiment analysis of selected LLMs for Indian languages, including Sanskrit, Telugu and Hindi. We select prominent texts that have been well translated by experts and use LLMs to generate their translations to English, and then we provide a comparison with selected expert (human) translations. Our findings suggest that while LLMs have made significant progress in translation accuracy, challenges remain in preserving sentiment and semantic integrity, especially in figurative and philosophical contexts. The sentiment analysis revealed that GPT-4o and GPT-3.5 are better at preserving the sentiments for the Bhagavad Gita (Sanskrit-English) translations when compared to Google Translate. We observed a similar trend for the case of Tamas (Hindi-English) and Maha P (Telugu-English) translations. GPT-4o performs similarly to GPT-3.5 in the translation in terms of sentiments for the three languages. We found that LLMs are generally better at translation for capturing sentiments when compared to Google Translate.</p></details> |  |

While RAG enhances response relevance by incorporating retrieved domain knowledge in the context, retrieval errors can still lead to hallucinations and incorrect answers. To recover from retriever failures, domain knowledge is injected by fine-tuning the model to generate the correct response, even in the case of retrieval errors. However, we observe that without systematic knowledge augmentation, fine-tuned LLMs may memorize new information but still fail to extract relevant domain knowledge, leading to poor performance. In this work, we present a novel framework that significantly enhances the fine-tuning process by augmenting the training data in two ways -- context augmentation and knowledge paraphrasing. In context augmentation, we create multiple training samples for a given QA pair by varying the relevance of the retrieved information, teaching the model when to ignore and when to rely on retrieved content. In knowledge paraphrasing, we fine-tune with multiple answers to the same question, enabling LLMs to better internalize specialized knowledge. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting due to fine-tuning, we add a domain-specific identifier to a question and also utilize a replay buffer containing general QA pairs. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our method over existing techniques, achieving up to 10\% relative gain in token-level recall while preserving the LLM's generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 14 tables, to be published in NAACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[Ontology Matching with Large Language Models and Prioritized Depth-First Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11441v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ontology matching (OM) plays a key role in enabling data interoperability and knowledge sharing, but it remains challenging due to the need for large training datasets and limited vocabulary processing in machine learning approaches. Recently, methods based on Large Language Model (LLMs) have shown great promise in OM, particularly through the use of a retrieve-then-prompt pipeline. In this approach, relevant target entities are first retrieved and then used to prompt the LLM to predict the final matches. Despite their potential, these systems still present limited performance and high computational overhead. To address these issues, we introduce MILA, a novel approach that embeds a retrieve-identify-prompt pipeline within a prioritized depth-first search (PDFS) strategy. This approach efficiently identifies a large number of semantic correspondences with high accuracy, limiting LLM requests to only the most borderline cases. We evaluated MILA using the biomedical challenge proposed in the 2023 and 2024 editions of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative. Our method achieved the highest F-Measure in four of the five unsupervised tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art OM systems by up to 17%. It also performed better than or comparable to the leading supervised OM systems. MILA further exhibited task-agnostic performance, remaining stable across all tasks and settings, while significantly reducing LLM requests. These findings highlight that high-performance LLM-based OM can be achieved through a combination of programmed (PDFS), learned (embedding vectors), and prompting-based heuristics, without the need of domain-specific heuristics or fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Controlling Large Language Model with Latent Actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21383v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to downstream tasks using Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven to be an effective approach. However, LLMs do not inherently define the structure of an agent for RL training, particularly in terms of defining the action space. This paper studies learning a compact latent action space to enhance the controllability and exploration of RL for LLMs. We propose Controlling Large Language Models with Latent Actions (CoLA), a framework that integrates a latent action space into pre-trained LLMs. We apply CoLA to the Llama-3.1-8B model. Our experiments demonstrate that, compared to RL with token-level actions, CoLA's latent action enables greater semantic diversity in text generation. For enhancing downstream tasks, we show that CoLA with RL achieves a score of 42.4 on the math500 benchmark, surpassing the baseline score of 38.2, and reaches 68.2 when augmented with a Monte Carlo Tree Search variant. Furthermore, CoLA with RL consistently improves performance on agent-based tasks without degrading the pre-trained LLM's capabilities, unlike the baseline. Finally, CoLA reduces computation time by half in tasks involving enhanced thinking prompts for LLMs by RL. These results highlight CoLA's potential to advance RL-based adaptation of LLMs for downstream applications.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we introduce OlymMATH, a novel Olympiad-level mathematical benchmark, designed to rigorously test the complex reasoning capabilities of LLMs. OlymMATH features 200 meticulously curated problems, each manually verified and available in parallel English and Chinese versions. The problems are systematically organized into two distinct difficulty tiers: (1) AIME-level problems (easy) that establish a baseline for mathematical reasoning assessment, and (2) significantly more challenging problems (hard) designed to push the boundaries of current state-of-the-art models. In our benchmark, these problems span four core mathematical fields, each including a verifiable numerical solution to enable objective, rule-based evaluation. Empirical results underscore the significant challenge presented by OlymMATH, with state-of-the-art models including DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI's o3-mini demonstrating notably limited accuracy on the hard subset. Furthermore, the benchmark facilitates comprehensive bilingual assessment of mathematical reasoning abilities-a critical dimension that remains largely unaddressed in mainstream mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

We describe a task where natural language user utterances are converted into formal constraints for smart appliances, within the broader context of a renewable energy community (REC) and in the Italian scenario. We evaluate the effectiveness of various LLMs currently available for Italian in translating these preferences resorting to classical zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot learning settings, using a pilot dataset of Italian user requests paired with corresponding formal constraint representation. Our contributions include establishing a baseline performance for this task, publicly releasing the dataset and code for further research, and providing insights on observed best practices and limitations of LLMs in this particular domain</p></details> |  |
| **[Using large language models to produce literature reviews: Usages and systematic biases of microphysics parametrizations in 2699 publications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21352v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models afford opportunities for using computers for intensive tasks, realizing research opportunities that have not been considered before. One such opportunity could be a systematic interrogation of the scientific literature. Here, we show how a large language model can be used to construct a literature review of 2699 publications associated with microphysics parametrizations in the Weather and Research Forecasting (WRF) model, with the goal of learning how they were used and their systematic biases, when simulating precipitation. The database was constructed of publications identified from Web of Science and Scopus searches. The large language model GPT-4 Turbo was used to extract information about model configurations and performance from the text of 2699 publications. Our results reveal the landscape of how nine of the most popular microphysics parameterizations have been used around the world: Lin, Ferrier, WRF Single-Moment, Goddard Cumulus Ensemble, Morrison, Thompson, and WRF Double-Moment. More studies used one-moment parameterizations before 2020 and two-moment parameterizations after 2020. Seven out of nine parameterizations tended to overestimate precipitation. However, systematic biases of parameterizations differed in various regions. Except simulations using the Lin, Ferrier, and Goddard parameterizations that tended to underestimate precipitation over almost all locations, the remaining six parameterizations tended to overestimate, particularly over China, southeast Asia, western United States, and central Africa. This method could be used by other researchers to help understand how the increasingly massive body of scientific literature can be harnessed through the power of artificial intelligence to solve their research problems.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we investigate the applicability of LLMs to the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP), a classic challenge in combinatorial optimization that requires efficient job allocation to machines to minimize makespan. To this end, we introduce Starjob, the first supervised dataset for JSSP, comprising 130k instances specifically designed for training LLMs. Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune the LLaMA 8B 4-bit quantized model with the LoRA method to develop an end-to-end scheduling approach. Our evaluation on standard benchmarks demonstrates that the proposed LLM-based method not only surpasses traditional Priority Dispatching Rules (PDRs) but also achieves notable improvements over state-of-the-art neural approaches like L2D, with an average improvement of 15.36% on DMU and 7.85% on Taillard benchmarks. These results highlight the untapped potential of LLMs in tackling combinatorial optimization problems, paving the way for future advancements in this area.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2408.06993</p></details> |

Using a German cardiology report dataset and the i2b2 Smoking Challenge dataset, we demonstrate that fine-tuning small LLMs locally on limited training data can improve performance achieving comparable results to larger models. Our experiments show that fine-tuning improves performance on both tasks, with notable gains observed with as few as 200-300 training examples. Overall, the study highlights the potential of task-specific fine-tuning of LLMs for automating clinical workflows and efficiently extracting structured data from unstructured medical text.</p></details> | 4 pages, 2 tables, |

Bug reports typically contain these inputs, which developers extract to facilitate debugging. Since bug reports are written in natural language, prior research has leveraged various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for automated input extraction. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), an important research question arises: how effectively can generative LLMs extract failure-inducing inputs from bug reports? In this paper, we propose LLPut, a technique to empirically evaluate the performance of three open-source generative LLMs -- LLaMA, Qwen, and Qwen-Coder -- in extracting relevant inputs from bug reports. We conduct an experimental evaluation on a dataset of 206 bug reports to assess the accuracy and effectiveness of these models. Our findings provide insights into the capabilities and limitations of generative LLMs in automated bug diagnosis.</p></details> |  |

However, these models face challenges in tasks that require spatial understanding within 3D environments. Efforts to enhance MLLMs, such as incorporating point cloud features, have been made, yet a considerable gap remains between the models' learned representations and the inherent complexity of 3D scenes. This discrepancy largely stems from the training of MLLMs on predominantly 2D data, which restricts their effectiveness in comprehending 3D spaces. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel generalist model, i.e., Video-3D LLM, for 3D scene understanding. By treating 3D scenes as dynamic videos and incorporating 3D position encoding into these representations, our Video-3D LLM aligns video representations with real-world spatial contexts more accurately. In addition, we have implemented a maximum coverage sampling technique to optimize the trade-off between computational cost and performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several 3D scene understanding benchmarks, including ScanRefer, Multi3DRefer, Scan2Cap, ScanQA, and SQA3D.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

However, despite these significant advancements, a systematic review and synthesis of the existing studies remain lacking. To address this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of the methodologies and applications of LLMs in traffic and transportation, highlighting their ability to process unstructured textual data to advance transportation research. We explore key applications, including autonomous driving, travel behavior prediction, and general transportation-related queries, alongside methodologies such as zero- or few-shot learning, prompt engineering, and fine-tuning. Our analysis identifies critical research gaps. From the methodological perspective, many research gaps can be addressed by integrating LLMs with existing tools and refining LLM architectures. From the application perspective, we identify numerous opportunities for LLMs to tackle a variety of traffic and transportation challenges, building upon existing research. By synthesizing these findings, this review not only clarifies the current state of LLM adoption and adaptation in traffic and transportation but also proposes future research directions, paving the way for smarter and more sustainable transportation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tricking Retrievers with Influential Tokens: An Efficient Black-Box Corpus Poisoning Attack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21315v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems enhance large language models by incorporating external knowledge, addressing issues like outdated internal knowledge and hallucination. However, their reliance on external knowledge bases makes them vulnerable to corpus poisoning attacks, where adversarial passages can be injected to manipulate retrieval results. Existing methods for crafting such passages, such as random token replacement or training inversion models, are often slow and computationally expensive, requiring either access to retriever's gradients or large computational resources. To address these limitations, we propose Dynamic Importance-Guided Genetic Algorithm (DIGA), an efficient black-box method that leverages two key properties of retrievers: insensitivity to token order and bias towards influential tokens. By focusing on these characteristics, DIGA dynamically adjusts its genetic operations to generate effective adversarial passages with significantly reduced time and memory usage. Our experimental evaluation shows that DIGA achieves superior efficiency and scalability compared to existing methods, while maintaining comparable or better attack success rates across multiple datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025 Main Track</p></details> |
| **[What Do You See? Enhancing Zero-Shot Image Classification with Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15668v4)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been effectively used for many computer vision tasks, including image classification. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective approach for zero-shot image classification using multimodal LLMs. Using multimodal LLMs, we generate comprehensive textual representations from input images. These textual representations are then utilized to generate fixed-dimensional features in a cross-modal embedding space. Subsequently, these features are fused together to perform zero-shot classification using a linear classifier. Our method does not require prompt engineering for each dataset; instead, we use a single, straightforward set of prompts across all datasets. We evaluated our method on several datasets and our results demonstrate its remarkable effectiveness, surpassing benchmark accuracy on multiple datasets. On average, for ten benchmarks, our method achieved an accuracy gain of 6.2 percentage points, with an increase of 6.8 percentage points on the ImageNet dataset, compared to prior methods re-evaluated with the same setup. Our findings highlight the potential of multimodal LLMs to enhance computer vision tasks such as zero-shot image classification, offering a significant improvement over traditional methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[InternVL-X: Advancing and Accelerating InternVL Series with Efficient Visual Token Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21307v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most multimodal large language models (MLLMs) treat visual tokens as "a sequence of text", integrating them with text tokens into a large language model (LLM). However, a great quantity of visual tokens significantly increases the demand for computational resources and time. In this paper, we propose InternVL-X, which outperforms the InternVL model in both performance and efficiency by incorporating three visual token compression methods. First, we propose a novel vision-language projector, PVTC. This component integrates adjacent visual embeddings to form a local query and utilizes the transformed CLS token as a global query, then performs point-to-region cross-attention through these local and global queries to more effectively convert visual features. Second, we present a layer-wise visual token compression module, LVTC, which compresses tokens in the LLM shallow layers and then expands them through upsampling and residual connections in the deeper layers. This significantly enhances the model computational efficiency. Futhermore, we propose an efficient high resolution slicing method, RVTC, which dynamically adjusts the number of visual tokens based on image area or length filtering. RVTC greatly enhances training efficiency with only a slight reduction in performance. By utilizing 20% or fewer visual tokens, InternVL-X achieves state-of-the-art performance on 7 public MLLM benchmarks, and improves the average metric by 2.34% across 12 tasks.</p></details> |  |

Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising solution by evaluating each reasoning step. However, existing PRMs typically output evaluation scores directly, limiting both learning efficiency and evaluation accuracy, which is further exacerbated by the scarcity of annotated data. To address these issues, we propose Reasoning-Driven Process Reward Modeling (R-PRM). First, we leverage stronger LLMs to generate seed data from limited annotations, effectively bootstrapping our model's reasoning capabilities and enabling comprehensive step-by-step evaluation. Second, we further enhance performance through preference optimization, without requiring additional annotated data. Third, we introduce inference-time scaling to fully harness the model's reasoning potential. Extensive experiments demonstrate R-PRM's effectiveness: on ProcessBench and PRMBench, it surpasses strong baselines by 11.9 and 8.5 points in F1 scores, respectively. When applied to guide mathematical reasoning, R-PRM achieves consistent accuracy improvements of over 8.5 points across six challenging datasets. Further analysis reveals that R-PRM exhibits more comprehensive evaluation and stronger generalization capabilities, thereby highlighting its significant potential.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The project is available at https://github.com/NJUNLP/R-PRM</p></details> |
| **[Cross-Tokenizer Distillation via Approximate Likelihood Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20083v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distillation has shown remarkable success in transferring knowledge from a Large Language Model (LLM) teacher to a student LLM. However, current distillation methods predominantly require the same tokenizer between the teacher and the student, restricting their applicability to only a small subset of teacher-student pairs. In this work, we develop a cross-tokenizer distillation method to solve this crucial deficiency. Our method is the first to enable cross-tokenizer distillation without a next-token prediction loss as the main objective, instead purely maximizing the student predictions' similarity to the teacher's predictions (known as pure distillation), while also being robust to large mismatches between the teacher and the student tokenizer function and vocabulary. Empirically, our method enables substantially improved performance as tested on two use cases. First, we show that viewing tokenizer transfer as self-distillation enables unprecedently effective transfer across tokenizers. We transfer (subword-level) Llama and Gemma models to byte-level tokenization more effectively than prior methods transfer to a similar subword tokenizer under a comparable training budget. Transferring different base models to the same tokenizer also enables ensembling them (e.g., via averaging their predicted probabilities) which boosts performance. Second, we use our cross-tokenizer distillation method to distil a large maths-specialized LLM into a smaller model, achieving competitive maths problem-solving performance. Overall, our results make substantial strides toward better adaptability and enhanced interaction between different LLMs.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Reinforced Model Merging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21272v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of large language models has garnered widespread attention for model merging techniques, especially training-free methods which combine model capabilities within the parameter space. However, two challenges remain: (1) uniform treatment of all parameters leads to performance degradation; (2) search-based algorithms are often inefficient. In this paper, we present an innovative framework termed Reinforced Model Merging (RMM), which encompasses an environment and agent tailored for merging tasks. These components interact to execute layer-wise merging actions, aiming to search the optimal merging architecture. Notably, RMM operates without any gradient computations on the original models, rendering it feasible for edge devices. Furthermore, by utilizing data subsets during the evaluation process, we addressed the bottleneck in the reward feedback phase, thereby accelerating RMM by up to 100 times. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RMM achieves state-of-the-art performance across various vision and NLP datasets and effectively overcomes the limitations of the existing baseline methods.

To address this gap, we introduce the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating LLMs with a near-sufficient set of sub-tasks of scientific discovery: inspiration retrieval, hypothesis composition, and hypothesis ranking. We develop an automated framework that extracts critical components - research questions, background surveys, inspirations, and hypotheses - from scientific papers across 12 disciplines, with expert validation confirming its accuracy. To prevent data contamination, we focus exclusively on papers published in 2024, ensuring minimal overlap with LLM pretraining data. Our evaluation reveals that LLMs perform well in retrieving inspirations, an out-of-distribution task, suggesting their ability to surface novel knowledge associations. This positions LLMs as "research hypothesis mines", capable of facilitating automated scientific discovery by generating innovative hypotheses at scale with minimal human intervention.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProReason: Multi-Modal Proactive Reasoning with Decoupled Eyesight and Wisdom](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14138v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have witnessed significant progress on visual understanding tasks. However, they often prioritize language knowledge over image information on visual reasoning tasks, incurring performance degradation. To tackle this issue, we first identify the drawbacks of existing solutions (i.e., insufficient and irrelevant visual descriptions, and limited multi-modal capacities). We then decompose visual reasoning process into two stages: visual perception (i.e., eyesight) and textual reasoning (i.e., wisdom), and introduce a novel visual reasoning framework named ProReason. This framework features multi-run proactive perception and decoupled vision-reasoning capabilities. Briefly, given a multi-modal question, ProReason iterates proactive information collection and reasoning until the answer can be concluded with necessary and sufficient visual descriptions. Notably, the disassociation of capabilities allows seamless integration of existing large language models (LLMs) to compensate for the reasoning deficits of LVLMs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that ProReason outperforms both existing multi-step reasoning frameworks and passive peer methods on a wide range of benchmarks for both open-source and closed-source models. In addition, with the assistance of LLMs, ProReason achieves a performance improvement of up to 15% on MMMU benchmark. Our insights into existing solutions and the decoupled perspective for feasible integration of LLMs illuminate future research on visual reasoning techniques, especially LLM-assisted ones.</p></details> |  |

Search engines, like Google, have been the number one way to find relevant data. They have always relied on the user's abilities to find the best information in its billions of links and sources at everybody's fingertips. The advent of large language models (LLMs) has completely transformed the field of information retrieval. The LLMs excel not only at retrieving relevant knowledge but also at summarizing it effectively, making information more accessible and consumable for users. On top of it, the rise of AI Agents has introduced another aspect to information retrieval i.e. dynamic information retrieval which enables the integration of real-time data such as weather forecasts, and financial data with the knowledge base to curate context-aware knowledge. However, despite these advancements the agents remain susceptible to issues of bias and fairness, challenges deeply rooted within the knowledge base and training of LLMs. This study introduces a novel approach to bias-aware knowledge retrieval by leveraging agentic framework and the innovative use of bias detectors as tools to identify and highlight inherent biases in the retrieved content. By empowering users with transparency and awareness, this approach aims to foster more equitable information systems and promote the development of responsible AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[R2-KG: General-Purpose Dual-Agent Framework for Reliable Reasoning on Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12767v4)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have combined Large Language Models (LLMs) with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to enhance reasoning, improving inference accuracy without additional training while mitigating hallucination. However, existing frameworks are often rigid, struggling to adapt to KG or task changes. They also rely heavily on powerful LLMs for reliable (i.e., trustworthy) reasoning. To address this, We introduce R2-KG, a plug-and-play, dual-agent framework that separates reasoning into two roles: an Operator (a low-capacity LLM) that gathers evidence and a Supervisor (a high-capacity LLM) that makes final judgments. This design is cost-efficient for LLM inference while still maintaining strong reasoning accuracy. Additionally, R2-KG employs an Abstention mechanism, generating answers only when sufficient evidence is collected from KG, which significantly enhances reliability. Experiments across multiple KG-based reasoning tasks show that R2-KG consistently outperforms baselines in both accuracy and reliability, regardless of the inherent capability of LLMs used as the Operator. Further experiments reveal that the single-agent version of R2-KG, equipped with a strict self-consistency strategy, achieves significantly higher-than-baseline reliability while reducing inference cost. However, it also leads to a higher abstention rate in complex KGs. Our findings establish R2-KG as a flexible and cost-effective solution for KG-based reasoning. It reduces reliance on high-capacity LLMs while ensuring trustworthy inference. The code is available at https://github.com/ekrxjwh2009/R2-KG/.</p></details> |  |

(2) Modifying the parameters of the existing router results in the erosion of previously acquired knowledge. In this paper, we present an innovative framework named LLaVA-CMoE, which is a continuous Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture without any replay data. Specifically, we have developed a method called Probe-Guided Knowledge Extension (PGKE), which employs probe experts to assess whether additional knowledge is required for a specific layer. This approach enables the model to adaptively expand its network parameters based on task distribution, thereby significantly improving the efficiency of parameter expansion. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical routing algorithm called Probabilistic Task Locator (PTL), where high-level routing captures inter-task information and low-level routing focuses on intra-task details, ensuring that new task experts do not interfere with existing ones. Our experiments shows that our efficient architecture has substantially improved model performance on the Coin benchmark while maintaining a reasonable parameter count.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Rethinking Graph Structure Learning in the Era of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21223v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has prompted researchers to explore the integration of language descriptions into graphs, aiming to enhance model encoding capabilities from a data-centric perspective. This graph representation is called text-attributed graphs (TAGs). A review of prior advancements highlights that graph structure learning (GSL) is a pivotal technique for improving data utility, making it highly relevant to efficient TAG learning. However, most GSL methods are tailored for traditional graphs without textual information, underscoring the necessity of developing a new GSL paradigm. Despite clear motivations, it remains challenging: (1) How can we define a reasonable optimization objective for GSL in the era of LLMs, considering the massive parameters in LLM? (2) How can we design an efficient model architecture that enables seamless integration of LLM for this optimization objective? For Question 1, we reformulate existing GSL optimization objectives as a tree optimization framework, shifting the focus from obtaining a well-trained edge predictor to a language-aware tree sampler. For Question 2, we propose decoupled and training-free model design principles for LLM integration, shifting the focus from computation-intensive fine-tuning to more efficient inference. Based on this, we propose Large Language and Tree Assistant (LLaTA), which leverages tree-based LLM in-context learning to enhance the understanding of topology and text, enabling reliable inference and generating improved graph structure. Extensive experiments on 10 TAG datasets demonstrate that LLaTA enjoys flexibility - incorporated with any backbone; scalability - outperforms other LLM-based GSL methods in terms of running efficiency; effectiveness - achieves SOTA performance.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures |

However, the performance of LLMs in repository-level context code translation remains suboptimal due to complex dependencies and context, hindering their adoption in industrial settings. In this work, we propose a novel LLM-based code translation technique K-Trans, which leverages triple knowledge augmentation to enhance LLM's translation quality under repository context in real-world software development. First, K-Trans constructs a translation knowledge base by extracting relevant information from target-language codebases, the repository being translated, and prior translation results. Second, for each function to be translated, K-Trans retrieves relevant triple knowledge, including target-language code samples, dependency usage examples, and successful translation function pairs, serving as references to enhance LLM for translation. Third, K-Trans constructs a knowledge-augmented translation prompt using the retrieved triple knowledge and employs LLMs to generate the translated code while preserving repository context. It further leverages LLMs for self-debugging, enhancing translation correctness. The experiments show that K-Trans substantially outperforms the baseline adapted from previous work by 19.4%/40.2% relative improvement in pass@1 and 0.138 in CodeBLEU. It is important to note that the results also demonstrate that each knowledge significantly contributes to K-Trans's effectiveness in handling repository-level context code translation, with dependency usage examples making the most notable contribution. Moreover, as the self-evolution process progresses, the knowledge base continuously enhances the LLM's performance across various aspects of the repository-level code translation.</p></details> |  |

This study evaluates structured reasoning techniques-Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Self-Consistency (SC-CoT), and Tree-of-Thought (ToT)-to improve classification accuracy across multiple mental health datasets sourced from Reddit. We analyze reasoning-driven prompting strategies, including Zero-shot CoT and Few-shot CoT, using key performance metrics such as Balanced Accuracy, F1 score, and Sensitivity/Specificity. Our findings indicate that reasoning-enhanced techniques improve classification performance over direct prediction, particularly in complex cases. Compared to baselines such as Zero Shot non-CoT Prompting, and fine-tuned pre-trained transformers such as BERT and Mental-RoBerta, and fine-tuned Open Source LLMs such as Mental Alpaca and Mental-Flan-T5, reasoning-driven LLMs yield notable gains on datasets like Dreaddit (+0.52\% over M-LLM, +0.82\% over BERT) and SDCNL (+4.67\% over M-LLM, +2.17\% over BERT). However, performance declines in Depression Severity, and CSSRS predictions suggest dataset-specific limitations, likely due to our using a more extensive test set. Among prompting strategies, Few-shot CoT consistently outperforms others, reinforcing the effectiveness of reasoning-driven LLMs. Nonetheless, dataset variability highlights challenges in model reliability and interpretability. This study provides a comprehensive benchmark of reasoning-based LLM techniques for mental health text classification. It offers insights into their potential for scalable clinical applications while identifying key challenges for future improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 Figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, these benchmarks fail to capture real-world complexities by focusing primarily on simple function-level translations and overlooking repository-level context (e.g., dependencies). Moreover, LLMs' effectiveness in translating to newer, low-resource languages like Rust remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce RustRepoTrans, the first repository-level code translation benchmark, comprising 375 tasks translating into Rust from C++, Java, and Python. Using this benchmark, we evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs, analyzing their errors to assess limitations in complex translation scenarios. Among them, Claude-3.5 performs best with 43.5% Pass@1, excelling in both basic functionality and additional translation abilities, such as noise robustness and syntactical difference identification. However, even Claude-3.5 experiences a 30.8% performance drop (Pass@1 from 74.3% to 43.5%) when handling repository-level context compared to previous benchmarks without such context. We also find that LLMs struggle with language differences in complex tasks, and dependencies further increase translation difficulty.</p></details> |  |

However, CoT still falls short in dealing with complex math word problems, as it usually suffers from three pitfalls: semantic misunderstanding errors, calculation errors, and step-missing errors. Prior studies involve addressing the calculation errors and step-missing errors, but neglect the semantic misunderstanding errors, which is the major factor limiting the reasoning performance of LLMs. To this end, we propose a simple-yet-effective method, namely Deeply Understanding the Problems (DUP), to improve the LLMs' math problem-solving ability by addressing semantic misunderstanding errors. The core of our method is to encourage the LLMs to deeply understand the problems and extract the key problem-solving information used for better reasoning.

| **[Resource-Efficient Federated Fine-Tuning Large Language Models for Heterogeneous Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21213v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) via federated learning, i.e., FedLLM, has been proposed to adapt LLMs for various downstream applications in a privacy-preserving way. To reduce the fine-tuning costs on resource-constrained devices, FedLoRA is proposed to fine-tune only a small subset of model parameters by integrating low-rank adaptation (LoRA) into FedLLM. However, apart from resource constraints, there is still another critical challenge, i.e., data heterogeneity, severely hindering the implementation of FedLoRA in practical applications. Herein, inspired by the previous group-based federated learning paradigm, we propose a hierarchical FedLoRA framework, termed HierFedLoRA, to address these challenges. Specifically, HierFedLoRA partitions all devices into multiple near-IID groups and adjusts the intra-group aggregation frequency for each group to eliminate the negative effects of non-IID data. Meanwhile, to reduce the computation and communication cost, HierFedLoRA dynamically assigns diverse and suitable fine-tuning depth (i.e., the number of continuous fine-tuning layers from the output) for each group. HierFedLoRA explores jointly optimizing aggregation frequency and depth upon their coupled relationship to better enhance the performance of FedLoRA. Extensive experiments are conducted on a physical platform with 80 commercial devices. The results show that HierFedLoRA improves the final model accuracy by 1.6% to 4.2%, speeding up the fine-tuning process by at least 2.1$\times$, compared to the strong baselines.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, the inherent repetition and similarity in medical data make it difficult for models to extract meaningful features, resulting in a tendency to overfit. So in this paper, we propose a multimodal model, Co-Attention Triple-LSTM Network (CA-TriNet), a deep learning model that combines transformer architectures with a Multi-LSTM network. Its Co-Attention module synergistically links a vision transformer with a text transformer to better differentiate medical images with similarities, augmented by an adaptive weight operator to catch and amplify image labels with minor similarities. Furthermore, its Triple-LSTM module refines generated sentences using targeted image objects. Extensive evaluations over three public datasets have demonstrated that CA-TriNet outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of comprehensive ability, even pre-trained large language models on some metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adapting Language-Specific LLMs to a Reasoning Model in One Day via Model Merging -- An Open Recipe](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09056v3)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates data selection and model merging methodologies aimed at incorporating advanced reasoning capabilities such as those of DeepSeek R1 into language-specific large language models (LLMs), with a particular focus on the Thai LLM. Our goal is to enhance the reasoning capabilities of language-specific LLMs while maintaining their target language abilities. DeepSeek R1 excels in reasoning but primarily benefits high-resource languages such as English and Chinese. However, low-resource languages remain underserved due to the dominance of English-centric training data and model optimizations, which limit performance in these languages. This limitation results in unreliable code-switching and diminished effectiveness on tasks in low-resource languages. Meanwhile, local and regional LLM initiatives have attempted to bridge this gap by developing language-specific LLMs that focus on improving local linguistic fidelity. We demonstrate that, with only publicly available datasets and a computational budget of $120, it is possible to enhance the reasoning capabilities of language-specific LLMs to match the level of DeepSeek R1, without compromising their performance on target language tasks.</p></details> | 9 pages |

A reasoning model is a relatively new type of generative model built on top of large language models (LLMs). A reasoning model generates a long chain of thought before arriving at a final answer, an approach found to improve performance on complex tasks. However, details on developing such a model are limited, especially for reasoning models that can generate traces in a low-resource language. Typhoon T1 presents an open effort that dives into the details of developing a reasoning model in a more cost-effective way by leveraging supervised fine-tuning using open datasets, instead of reinforcement learning. This paper shares the details about synthetic data generation and training, as well as our dataset and model weights. Additionally, we provide insights gained from developing a reasoning model that generalizes across domains and is capable of generating reasoning traces in a low-resource language, using Thai as an example. We hope this open effort provides a foundation for further research in this field.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6 figures |

Their limitations are pronounced in fields like Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), where cultural and clinical subtleties are vital, further hindered by a lack of domain-specific data, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). To address these issues, this paper introduces Hengqin-RA-v1, the first large language model specifically tailored for TCM with a focus on diagnosing and treating RA. We also present HQ-GCM-RA-C1, a comprehensive RA-specific dataset curated from ancient Chinese medical literature, classical texts, and modern clinical studies. This dataset empowers Hengqin-RA-v1 to deliver accurate and culturally informed responses, effectively bridging the gaps left by general-purpose models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Hengqin-RA-v1 outperforms state-of-the-art models, even surpassing the diagnostic accuracy of TCM practitioners in certain cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, AAAI-2025 Workshop</p></details> |

However, adoption remains limited particularly among small and medium enterprises due to high implementation costs, fragmented emission factor databases, and a lack of robust sector classification methods. To address these challenges, we introduce Group Reasoning Emission Estimation Networks (GREEN), an AI-driven carbon accounting framework that standardizes enterprise-level emission estimation, constructs a large-scale benchmark dataset, and leverages a novel reasoning approach with large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we compile textual descriptions for 20,850 companies with validated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) labels and align these with an economic model of carbon intensity factors. By reframing sector classification as an information retrieval task, we fine-tune Sentence-BERT models using a contrastive learning loss. To overcome the limitations of single-stage models in handling thousands of hierarchical categories, we propose a Group Reasoning method that ensembles LLM classifiers based on the natural NAICS ontology, decomposing the task into multiple sub-classification steps. We theoretically prove that this approach reduces classification uncertainty and computational complexity. Experiments on 1,114 NAICS categories yield state-of-the-art performance (83.68% Top-1, 91.47% Top-10 accuracy), and case studies on 20 companies report a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 45.88%.

As robots and AI systems become more prevalent in caregiving, healthcare, and education, the demand for AI that can interact naturally with humans grows. However, creating AI that seamlessly integrates multiple modalities, such as vision and speech, remains a challenge. Current video-based methods for social intelligence rely on general video recognition or emotion recognition techniques, often overlook the unique elements inherent in human interactions. To address this, we propose the Looped Video Debating (LVD) framework, which integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with visual information, such as facial expressions and body movements, to enhance the transparency and reliability of question-answering tasks involving human interaction videos. Our results on the Social-IQ 2.0 benchmark show that LVD achieves state-of-the-art performance without fine-tuning. Furthermore, supplementary human annotations on existing datasets provide insights into the model's accuracy, guiding future improvements in AI-driven social intelligence.</p></details> |  |

However, integrating reasoning with external search processes remains challenging, especially for complex multi-hop questions requiring multiple retrieval steps. We propose ReSearch, a novel framework that trains LLMs to Reason with Search via reinforcement learning without using any supervised data on reasoning steps. Our approach treats search operations as integral components of the reasoning chain, where when and how to perform searches is guided by text-based thinking, and search results subsequently influence further reasoning. We train ReSearch on Qwen2.5-7B(-Instruct) and Qwen2.5-32B(-Instruct) models and conduct extensive experiments. Despite being trained on only one dataset, our models demonstrate strong generalizability across various benchmarks. Analysis reveals that ReSearch naturally elicits advanced reasoning capabilities such as reflection and self-correction during the reinforcement learning process.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[Reinforced Lifelong Editing for Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05759v3)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) acquire information from pre-training corpora, but their stored knowledge can become inaccurate or outdated over time. Model editing addresses this challenge by modifying model parameters without retraining, and prevalent approaches leverage hypernetworks to generate these parameter updates. However, they face significant challenges in lifelong editing due to their incompatibility with LLM parameters that dynamically change during the editing process. To address this, we observed that hypernetwork-based lifelong editing aligns with reinforcement learning modeling and proposed RLEdit, an RL-based editing method. By treating editing losses as rewards and optimizing hypernetwork parameters at the full knowledge sequence level, we enable it to precisely capture LLM changes and generate appropriate parameter updates. Our extensive empirical evaluation across several LLMs demonstrates that RLEdit outperforms existing methods in lifelong editing with superior effectiveness and efficiency, achieving a 59.24% improvement while requiring only 2.11% of the time compared to most approaches. Our code is available at: https://github.com/zhrli324/RLEdit.</p></details> |  |

Despite Tibetan being spoken by over seven million people, it has largely been neglected in the development and assessment of LLMs. To address this gap, we present TLUE (A Tibetan Language Understanding Evaluation Benchmark), the first large-scale benchmark for assessing LLMs' capabilities in Tibetan. TLUE comprises two major components: (1) a comprehensive multi-task understanding benchmark spanning 5 domains and 67 subdomains, and (2) a safety benchmark covering 7 subdomains. We evaluate a diverse set of state-of-the-art LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that most LLMs perform below the random baseline, highlighting the considerable challenges LLMs face in processing Tibetan, a low-resource language. TLUE provides an essential foundation for driving future research and progress in Tibetan language understanding and underscores the need for greater inclusivity in LLM development.</p></details> | 6 figures, 21 pages |

Synthesizing tool-use data through real-world simulations is an effective way to achieve it. Nevertheless, our investigation reveals that (1) training gains significantly decay as synthetic data increases. The model struggles to benefit from more synthetic data due to potential data diversity issues, resulting in poor performance in complex scenarios. Moreover, we find that (2) this challenge primarily manifests as minor discrepancies between the model's output and the ground truth response (termed as deficiency), such as errors in parameter values that require complex reasoning from the context to resolve. To this end, we propose an iterative reinforced fine-tuning strategy designed to alleviate these challenges. This strategy involves: (1) enhancing the diversity of synthetic data through path exploration of Monte Carlo Tree Search. (2) iteratively identifying deficiency-related data, constructing fine-grained preference pairs to pinpoint deficiencies, and then applying preference optimization to optimize these deficiencies. Our experiments show that models trained using our method achieve about 12\% better performance than baseline models, outperforming larger open-source and closed-source models.</p></details> | under review ACL |

While evolutionary computation is well-known for its great results both in feature selection and feature construction, its methods are computationally expensive due to the large number of evaluations required to induce the final model. Part of the reason why these algorithms require a large number of evaluations is their lack of domain-specific knowledge, resulting in a lot of random guessing during evolution. In this work, we propose using Large Language Models (LLMs) as an initial feature construction step to add knowledge to the dataset. By doing so, our results show that the evolution can converge faster, saving us computational resources. The proposed approach only provides the names of the features in the dataset and the target objective to the LLM, making it usable even when working with datasets containing private data. While consistent improvements to test performance were only observed for one-third of the datasets (CSS, PM, and IM10), possibly due to problems being easily explored by LLMs, this approach only decreased the model performance in 1/77 test cases. Additionally, this work introduces the M6GP feature engineering algorithm to symbolic regression, showing it can improve the results of the random forest regressor and produce competitive results with its predecessor, M3GP.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

While AI-empowered story-reading tools have been increasingly used, their abilities to support personalized interaction with children are still limited. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) show promise in facilitating personalized interactions, but little is known about how to effectively and appropriately use LLMs to enhance children's personalized story-reading experiences. This work explores this question through a design-based study. Drawing on a formative study, we designed and developed StoryMate, an LLM-empowered personalized interactive story-reading tool for children, following an empirical study with children, parents, and education experts. Our participants valued the personalized features in StoryMate, and also highlighted the need to support personalized content, guiding mechanisms, reading context variations, and interactive interfaces. Based on these findings, we propose a series of design recommendations for better using LLMs to empower children's personalized story reading and interaction.</p></details> | Accepted at CHI 2025 |

Quantization is an effective method that not only compresses the models but also significantly accelerates their performance. Existing quantization methods have gradually shifted the focus from parameter scaling to the analysis of data distributions. However, their analysis is designed for dense LLMs and relies on the simple one-model-all-data mapping, which is unsuitable for MoEs. This paper proposes a new quantization framework called MoQa. MoQa decouples the data-model distribution complexity of MoEs in multiple analysis stages, quantitively revealing the dynamics during sparse data activation, data-parameter mapping, and inter-expert correlations. Based on these, MoQa identifies particular experts' and parameters' significance with optimal data-model distribution awareness and proposes a series of fine-grained mix-quantization strategies adaptive to various data activation and expert combination scenarios. Moreover, MoQa discusses the limitations of existing quantization and analyzes the impact of each stage analysis, showing novel insights for MoE quantization. Experiments show that MoQa achieves a 1.69~2.18 perplexity decrease in language modeling tasks and a 1.58%~8.91% accuracy improvement in zero-shot inference tasks. We believe MoQa will play a role in future MoE construction, optimization, and compression.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures and 3 tables</p></details> |

Conventional deep learning methodologies employing small language models (SLMs) suffer from the necessity for extensive supervised training and the challenge of adapting to rapidly evolving circumstances. Large language models (LLMs), despite their robust zero-shot capabilities, have fallen short in effectively identifying fake news due to a lack of pertinent demonstrations and the dynamic nature of knowledge. In this paper, a novel framework Multi-Round Collaboration Detection (MRCD) is proposed to address these aforementioned limitations. The MRCD framework is capable of enjoying the merits from both LLMs and SLMs by integrating their generalization abilities and specialized functionalities, respectively. Our approach features a two-stage retrieval module that selects relevant and up-to-date demonstrations and knowledge, enhancing in-context learning for better detection of emerging news events. We further design a multi-round learning framework to ensure more reliable detection results. Our framework MRCD achieves SOTA results on two real-world datasets Pheme and Twitter16, with accuracy improvements of 7.4\% and 12.8\% compared to using only SLMs, which effectively addresses the limitations of current models and improves the detection of emergent fake news.</p></details> |  |

Current model editing methods, however, struggle with long-form knowledge in diverse formats, such as poetry, code snippets, and mathematical derivations. These limitations arise from their reliance on editing a single token's hidden state, a limitation we term "efficacy barrier". To solve this, we propose AnyEdit, a new autoregressive editing paradigm. It decomposes long-form knowledge into sequential chunks and iteratively edits the key token in each chunk, ensuring consistent and accurate outputs. Theoretically, we ground AnyEdit in the Chain Rule of Mutual Information, showing its ability to update any knowledge within LLMs. Empirically, it outperforms strong baselines by 21.5% on benchmarks including UnKEBench, AKEW, and our new EditEverything dataset for long-form diverse-formatted knowledge. Additionally, AnyEdit serves as a plug-and-play framework, enabling current editing methods to update knowledge with arbitrary length and format, significantly advancing the scope and practicality of LLM knowledge editing.</p></details> |  |

In current volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) environments, dynamic risk assessment becomes essential to ensure successful hub deployment. However, traditional methods often struggle to effectively capture and analyze unstructured information. In this paper, we design an Large Language Model (LLM)-driven risk assessment pipeline integrated with multiple analytical tools to evaluate logistic hub deployment. This framework enables LLMs to systematically identify potential risks by analyzing unstructured data, such as geopolitical instability, financial trends, historical storm events, traffic conditions, and emerging risks from news sources. These data are processed through a suite of analytical tools, which are automatically called by LLMs to support a structured and data-driven decision-making process for logistic hub selection. In addition, we design prompts that instruct LLMs to leverage these tools for assessing the feasibility of hub selection by evaluating various risk types and levels. Through risk-based similarity analysis, LLMs cluster logistic hubs with comparable risk profiles, enabling a structured approach to risk assessment. In conclusion, the framework incorporates scalability with long-term memory and enhances decision-making through explanation and interpretation, enabling comprehensive risk assessments for logistic hub deployment in hyperconnected supply chain networks.</p></details> |  |

However, inferring state machines from network protocol implementations is challenging due to complex code syntax and semantics. Traditional dynamic analysis methods often miss critical state transitions due to limited coverage, while static analysis faces path explosion issues. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel state machine inference approach utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs), named ProtocolGPT. This method employs retrieval augmented generation technology to enhance a pre-trained model with specific knowledge from protocol implementations. Through effective prompt engineering, we accurately identify and infer state machines. To the best of our knowledge, our approach represents the first state machine inference that leverages the source code of protocol implementations. Our evaluation of six protocol implementations shows that our method achieves a precision of over 90%, outperforming the baselines by more than 30%. Furthermore, integrating our approach with protocol fuzzing improves coverage by more than 20% and uncovers two 0-day vulnerabilities compared to baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

Despite its remarkable advantages and potential, LLM-based GR suffers from hallucination and generates documents that are irrelevant to the query in some instances, severely challenging its credibility in practical applications. We thereby propose an optimized GR framework designed to alleviate retrieval hallucination, which integrates knowledge distillation reasoning in model training and incorporate decision agent to further improve retrieval precision. Specifically, we employ LLMs to assess and reason GR retrieved query-document (q-d) pairs, and then distill the reasoning data as transferred knowledge to the GR model. Moreover, we utilize a decision agent as post-processing to extend the GR retrieved documents through retrieval model and select the most relevant ones from multi perspectives as the final generative retrieval result. Extensive offline experiments on real-world datasets and online A/B tests on Fund Search and Insurance Search in Alipay demonstrate our framework's superiority and effectiveness in improving search quality and conversion gains.</p></details> | 4 pages |

However, these models are prone to hallucinations, which limit their reliability as artificial intelligence systems. While this issue is extensively researched in natural language processing and image captioning, there remains a lack of investigation of hallucinations in Low-level Visual Perception and Understanding (HLPU), especially in the context of image quality assessment tasks. We consider that these hallucinations arise from an absence of clear self-awareness within the models. To address this issue, we first introduce the HLPU instruction database, the first instruction database specifically focused on hallucinations in low-level vision tasks. This database contains approximately 200K question-answer pairs and comprises four subsets, each covering different types of instructions. Subsequently, we propose the Self-Awareness Failure Elimination (SAFEQA) model, which utilizes image features, salient region features and quality features to improve the perception and comprehension abilities of the model in low-level vision tasks. Furthermore, we propose the Enhancing Self-Awareness Preference Optimization (ESA-PO) framework to increase the model's awareness of knowledge boundaries, thereby mitigating the incidence of hallucination. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on low-level vision tasks, with the results demonstrating that our proposed method significantly enhances self-awareness of the model in these tasks and reduces hallucinations. Notably, our proposed method improves both accuracy and self-awareness of the proposed model and outperforms close-source models in terms of various evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |

This task aims to selectively erase sensitive knowledge from large language models, avoiding both over-forgetting and under-forgetting issues. We propose an unlearning system that leverages Model Merging (specifically TIES-Merging), combining two specialized models into a more balanced unlearned model. Our system achieves competitive results, ranking second among 26 teams, with an online score of 0.944 for Task Aggregate and 0.487 for overall Aggregate. In this paper, we also conduct local experiments and perform a comprehensive analysis of the unlearning process, examining performance trajectories, loss dynamics, and weight perspectives, along with several supplementary experiments, to understand the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, we analyze the shortcomings of our method and evaluation metrics, emphasizing that MIA scores and ROUGE-based metrics alone are insufficient to fully evaluate successful unlearning. Finally, we emphasize the need for more comprehensive evaluation methodologies and rethinking of unlearning objectives in future research.

Evaluating these agents is critical to ensuring their performance and safety, especially given their dynamic, probabilistic, and evolving nature. However, traditional approaches such as predefined test cases and standard redevelopment pipelines struggle to address the unique challenges of LLM agent evaluation. These challenges include capturing open-ended behaviors, handling emergent outcomes, and enabling continuous adaptation over the agent's lifecycle. To address these issues, we propose an evaluation-driven development approach, inspired by test-driven and behavior-driven development but reimagined for the unique characteristics of LLM agents. Through a multivocal literature review (MLR), we synthesize the limitations of existing LLM evaluation methods and introduce a novel process model and reference architecture tailored for evaluation-driven development of LLM agents. Our approach integrates online (runtime) and offline (redevelopment) evaluations, enabling adaptive runtime adjustments and systematic iterative refinement of pipelines, artifacts, system architecture, and LLMs themselves. By continuously incorporating evaluation results, including fine-grained feedback from human and AI evaluators, into each stage of development and operation, this framework ensures that LLM agents remain aligned with evolving goals, user needs, and governance standards.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bias Evaluation and Mitigation in Retrieval-Augmented Medical Question-Answering Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15454v3)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical Question Answering systems based on Retrieval Augmented Generation is promising for clinical decision support because they can integrate external knowledge, thus reducing inaccuracies inherent in standalone large language models (LLMs). However, these systems may unintentionally propagate or amplify biases associated with sensitive demographic attributes like race, gender, and socioeconomic factors. This study systematically evaluates demographic biases within medical RAG pipelines across multiple QA benchmarks, including MedQA, MedMCQA, MMLU, and EquityMedQA. We quantify disparities in retrieval consistency and answer correctness by generating and analyzing queries sensitive to demographic variations. We further implement and compare several bias mitigation strategies to address identified biases, including Chain of Thought reasoning, Counterfactual filtering, Adversarial prompt refinement, and Majority Vote aggregation. Experimental results reveal significant demographic disparities, highlighting that Majority Vote aggregation notably improves accuracy and fairness metrics. Our findings underscore the critical need for explicitly fairness-aware retrieval methods and prompt engineering strategies to develop truly equitable medical QA systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[MANTRA: Enhancing Automated Method-Level Refactoring with Contextual RAG and Multi-Agent LLM Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14340v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maintaining and scaling software systems relies heavily on effective code refactoring, yet this process remains labor-intensive, requiring developers to carefully analyze existing codebases and prevent the introduction of new defects. Although recent advancements have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate refactoring tasks, current solutions are constrained in scope and lack mechanisms to guarantee code compilability and successful test execution. In this work, we introduce MANTRA, a comprehensive LLM agent-based framework that automates method-level refactoring. MANTRA integrates Context-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation, coordinated Multi-Agent Collaboration, and Verbal Reinforcement Learning to emulate human decision-making during refactoring while preserving code correctness and readability. Our empirical study, conducted on 703 instances of "pure refactorings" (i.e., code changes exclusively involving structural improvements), drawn from 10 representative Java projects, covers the six most prevalent refactoring operations. Experimental results demonstrate that MANTRA substantially surpasses a baseline LLM model (RawGPT ), achieving an 82.8% success rate (582/703) in producing code that compiles and passes all tests, compared to just 8.7% (61/703) with RawGPT. Moreover, in comparison to IntelliJ's LLM-powered refactoring tool (EM-Assist), MANTRA exhibits a 50% improvement in generating Extract Method transformations. A usability study involving 37 professional developers further shows that refactorings performed by MANTRA are perceived to be as readable and reusable as human-written code, and in certain cases, even more favorable. These results highlight the practical advantages of MANTRA and emphasize the growing potential of LLM-based systems in advancing the automation of software refactoring tasks.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[EQ-Negotiator: An Emotion-Reasoning LLM Agent in Credit Dialogues](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21080v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language model (LLM)-based chatbots have been applied for effective engagement in credit dialogues, their capacity for dynamic emotional expression remains limited. Current agents primarily rely on passive empathy rather than affective reasoning. For instance, when faced with persistent client negativity, the agent should employ strategic emotional adaptation by expressing measured anger to discourage counterproductive behavior and guide the conversation toward resolution. This context-aware emotional modulation is essential for imitating the nuanced decision-making of human negotiators. This paper introduces an EQ-negotiator that combines emotion sensing from pre-trained language models (PLMs) with emotional reasoning based on Game Theory and Hidden Markov Models. It takes into account both the current and historical emotions of the client to better manage and address negative emotions during interactions. By fine-tuning pre-trained language models (PLMs) on public emotion datasets and validating them on the credit dialogue datasets, our approach enables LLM-based agents to effectively capture shifts in client emotions and dynamically adjust their response tone based on our emotion decision policies in real-world financial negotiations. This EQ-negotiator can also help credit agencies foster positive client relationships, enhancing satisfaction in credit services.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Reasoning Video Segmentation with Just-in-Time Digital Twins](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21056v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning segmentation (RS) aims to identify and segment objects of interest based on implicit text queries. As such, RS is a catalyst for embodied AI agents, enabling them to interpret high-level commands without requiring explicit step-by-step guidance. However, current RS approaches rely heavily on the visual perception capabilities of multimodal large language models (LLMs), leading to several major limitations. First, they struggle with queries that require multiple steps of reasoning or those that involve complex spatial/temporal relationships. Second, they necessitate LLM fine-tuning, which may require frequent updates to maintain compatibility with contemporary LLMs and may increase risks of catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. Finally, being primarily designed for static images or offline video processing, they scale poorly to online video data. To address these limitations, we propose an agent framework that disentangles perception and reasoning for online video RS without LLM fine-tuning. Our innovation is the introduction of a just-in-time digital twin concept, where -- given an implicit query -- a LLM plans the construction of a low-level scene representation from high-level video using specialist vision models. We refer to this approach to creating a digital twin as "just-in-time" because the LLM planner will anticipate the need for specific information and only request this limited subset instead of always evaluating every specialist model. The LLM then performs reasoning on this digital twin representation to identify target objects. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new comprehensive video reasoning segmentation benchmark comprising 200 videos with 895 implicit text queries. The benchmark spans three reasoning categories (semantic, spatial, and temporal) with three different reasoning chain complexity.</p></details> |  |

State-Change Counterfactuals for Procedure-Aware Video Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21055v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding a procedural activity requires modeling both how action steps transform the scene, and how evolving scene transformations can influence the sequence of action steps, even those that are accidental or erroneous. Existing work has studied procedure-aware video representations by proposing novel approaches such as modeling the temporal order of actions and has not explicitly learned the state changes (scene transformations). In this work, we study procedure-aware video representation learning by incorporating state-change descriptions generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) as supervision signals for video encoders. Moreover, we generate state-change counterfactuals that simulate hypothesized failure outcomes, allowing models to learn by imagining the unseen ``What if'' scenarios. This counterfactual reasoning facilitates the model's ability to understand the cause and effect of each step in an activity. To verify the procedure awareness of our model, we conduct extensive experiments on procedure-aware tasks, including temporal action segmentation and error detection. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed state-change descriptions and their counterfactuals and achieve significant improvements on multiple tasks. We will make our source code and data publicly available soon.</p></details> | 16 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Operating Room Workflow Analysis via Reasoning Segmentation over Digital Twins](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21054v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing operating room (OR) workflows to derive quantitative insights into OR efficiency is important for hospitals to maximize patient care and financial sustainability. Prior work on OR-level workflow analysis has relied on end-to-end deep neural networks. While these approaches work well in constrained settings, they are limited to the conditions specified at development time and do not offer the flexibility necessary to accommodate the OR workflow analysis needs of various OR scenarios (e.g., large academic center vs. rural provider) without data collection, annotation, and retraining. Reasoning segmentation (RS) based on foundation models offers this flexibility by enabling automated analysis of OR workflows from OR video feeds given only an implicit text query related to the objects of interest. Due to the reliance on large language model (LLM) fine-tuning, current RS approaches struggle with reasoning about semantic/spatial relationships and show limited generalization to OR video due to variations in visual characteristics and domain-specific terminology. To address these limitations, we first propose a novel digital twin (DT) representation that preserves both semantic and spatial relationships between the various OR components. Then, building on this foundation, we propose ORDiRS (Operating Room Digital twin representation for Reasoning Segmentation), an LLM-tuning-free RS framework that reformulates RS into a "reason-retrieval-synthesize" paradigm. Finally, we present ORDiRS-Agent, an LLM-based agent that decomposes OR workflow analysis queries into manageable RS sub-queries and generates responses by combining detailed textual explanations with supporting visual evidence from RS. Experimental results on both an in-house and a public OR dataset demonstrate that our ORDiRS achieves a cIoU improvement of 6.12%-9.74% compared to the existing state-of-the-arts.</p></details> |  |

While RAG enhances response relevance by incorporating retrieved domain knowledge in the context, retrieval errors can still lead to hallucinations and incorrect answers. To recover from retriever failures, domain knowledge is injected by fine-tuning the model to generate the correct response, even in the case of retrieval errors. However, we observe that without systematic knowledge augmentation, fine-tuned LLMs may memorize new information but still fail to extract relevant domain knowledge, leading to poor performance. In this work, we present a novel framework that significantly enhances the fine-tuning process by augmenting the training data in two ways -- context augmentation and knowledge paraphrasing. In context augmentation, we create multiple training samples for a given QA pair by varying the relevance of the retrieved information, teaching the model when to ignore and when to rely on retrieved content. In knowledge paraphrasing, we fine-tune with multiple answers to the same question, enabling LLMs to better internalize specialized knowledge. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting due to fine-tuning, we add a domain-specific identifier to a question and also utilize a replay buffer containing general QA pairs. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our method over existing techniques, achieving up to 10\% relative gain in token-level recall while preserving the LLM's generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 14 tables, to be published in NAACL 2025</p></details> |

Our study reveals that, across diverse RAG applications, some of these approaches consistently detect incorrect RAG responses with high precision/recall.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Does RAG Introduce Unfairness in LLMs? Evaluating Fairness in Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19804v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has recently gained significant attention for its enhanced ability to integrate external knowledge sources into open-domain question answering (QA) tasks. However, it remains unclear how these models address fairness concerns, particularly with respect to sensitive attributes such as gender, geographic location, and other demographic factors. First, as language models evolve to prioritize utility, like improving exact match accuracy, fairness considerations may have been largely overlooked. Second, the complex, multi-component architecture of RAG methods poses challenges in identifying and mitigating biases, as each component is optimized for distinct objectives. In this paper, we aim to empirically evaluate fairness in several RAG methods. We propose a fairness evaluation framework tailored to RAG, using scenario-based questions and analyzing disparities across demographic attributes. Our experimental results indicate that, despite recent advances in utility-driven optimization, fairness issues persist in both the retrieval and generation stages. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions to address fairness concerns throughout the RAG pipeline. The dataset and code used in this study are publicly available at this GitHub Repository https://github.com/elviswxy/RAG_fairness .</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at COLING 2025</p></details> |
| **[Balancing Content Size in RAG-Text2SQL System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15723v3)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising solution for converting natural language queries into SQL commands, enabling seamless database interaction. However, these Text-to-SQL (Text2SQL) systems face inherent limitations, hallucinations, outdated knowledge, and untraceable reasoning. To address these challenges, the integration of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with Text2SQL models has gained traction. RAG serves as a retrieval mechanism, providing essential contextual information, such as table schemas and metadata, to enhance the query generation process. Despite their potential, RAG + Text2SQL systems are susceptible to the quality and size of retrieved documents. While richer document content can improve schema relevance and retrieval accuracy, it also introduces noise, increasing the risk of hallucinations and reducing query fidelity as the prompt size of the Text2SQL model increases. This research investigates the nuanced trade-off between document size and quality, aiming to strike a balance that optimizes system performance. Key thresholds are identified where performance degradation occurs, along with actionable strategies to mitigate these challenges. Additionally, we explore the phenomenon of hallucinations in Text2SQL models, emphasizing the critical role of curated document presentation in minimizing errors. Our findings provide a roadmap for enhancing the robustness of RAG + Text2SQL systems, offering practical insights for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tuning LLMs by RAG Principles: Towards LLM-native Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16071v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Memory, additional information beyond the training of large language models (LLMs), is crucial to various real-world applications, such as personal assistant. The two mainstream solutions to incorporate memory into the generation process are long-context LLMs and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). In this paper, we first systematically compare these two types of solutions on three renovated/new datasets and show that (1) long-context solutions, although more expensive, shall be easier to capture the big picture and better answer queries which require considering the memory as a whole; and (2) when the queries concern specific information, RAG solutions shall be more competitive especially when the keywords can be explicitly matched. Therefore, we propose a novel method RAG-Tuned-LLM which fine-tunes a relative small (e.g., 7B) LLM using the data generated following the RAG principles, so it can combine the advantages of both solutions. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that RAG-Tuned-LLM can beat long-context LLMs and RAG methods across a wide range of query types.</p></details> |  |

This section serves as a valuable resource for early-career researchers seeking unexplored areas and experienced researchers looking for new projects or collaborations. In this study, we generate future work suggestions from key sections of a scientific article alongside related papers and analyze how the trends have evolved. We experimented with various Large Language Models (LLMs) and integrated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance the generation process. We incorporate a LLM feedback mechanism to improve the quality of the generated content and propose an LLM-as-a-judge approach for evaluation. Our results demonstrated that the RAG-based approach with LLM feedback outperforms other methods evaluated through qualitative and quantitative metrics. Moreover, we conduct a human evaluation to assess the LLM as an extractor and judge. The code and dataset for this project are here, code: HuggingFace</p></details> | 19 pages, 5 figures |

The recent purposed Mixed-Precision Over-the-Air Federated Learning (MP-OTA-FL) enables clients to operate at appropriate precision levels based on their heterogeneous hardware, taking advantages of the larger trade-off space while covering the quantization overheads in the mixed-precision modulation scheme for the OTA aggregation process. A key to further exploring the potential of the MP-OTA-FL framework is the optimization of client precision levels. The choice of precision level hinges on multifaceted factors including hardware capability, potential client contribution, and user satisfaction, among which factors can be difficult to define or quantify. In this paper, we propose a RAG-based User Profiling for precision planning framework that integrates retrieval-augmented LLMs and dynamic client profiling to optimize satisfaction and contributions. This includes a hybrid interface for gathering device/user insights and an RAG database storing historical quantization decisions with feedback. Experiments show that our method boosts satisfaction, energy savings, and global model accuracy in MP-OTA-FL systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, submitted to IEEE VTC 2025 fall for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[A RAG-based Question Answering System Proposal for Understanding Islam: MufassirQAS LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15378v5)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Challenges exist in learning and understanding religions, such as the complexity and depth of religious doctrines and teachings. Chatbots as question-answering systems can help in solving these challenges. LLM chatbots use NLP techniques to establish connections between topics and accurately respond to complex questions. These capabilities make it perfect for enlightenment on religion as a question-answering chatbot. However, LLMs also tend to generate false information, known as hallucination. Also, the chatbots' responses can include content that insults personal religious beliefs, interfaith conflicts, and controversial or sensitive topics. It must avoid such cases without promoting hate speech or offending certain groups of people or their beliefs. This study uses a vector database-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to enhance the accuracy and transparency of LLMs. Our question-answering system is called "MufassirQAS". We created a database consisting of several open-access books that include Turkish context. These books contain Turkish translations and interpretations of Islam. This database is utilized to answer religion-related questions and ensure our answers are trustworthy. The relevant part of the dataset, which LLM also uses, is presented along with the answer. We have put careful effort into creating system prompts that give instructions to prevent harmful, offensive, or disrespectful responses to respect people's values and provide reliable results. The system answers and shares additional information, such as the page number from the respective book and the articles referenced for obtaining the information. MufassirQAS and ChatGPT are also tested with sensitive questions. We got better performance with our system. Study and enhancements are still in progress. Results and future works are given.</p></details> |  |
| **[SOSecure: Safer Code Generation with RAG and StackOverflow Discussions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13654v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for automated code generation. Their reliance on infrequently updated pretraining data leaves them unaware of newly discovered vulnerabilities and evolving security standards, making them prone to producing insecure code. In contrast, developer communities on Stack Overflow (SO) provide an ever-evolving repository of knowledge, where security vulnerabilities are actively discussed and addressed through collective expertise. These community-driven insights remain largely untapped by LLMs. This paper introduces SOSecure, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that leverages the collective security expertise found in SO discussions to improve the security of LLM-generated code. We build a security-focused knowledge base by extracting SO answers and comments that explicitly identify vulnerabilities. Unlike common uses of RAG, SOSecure triggers after code has been generated to find discussions that identify flaws in similar code. These are used in a prompt to an LLM to consider revising the code. Evaluation across three datasets (SALLM, LLMSecEval, and LMSys) show that SOSecure achieves strong fix rates of 71.7%, 91.3%, and 96.7% respectively, compared to prompting GPT-4 without relevant discussions (49.1%, 56.5%, and 37.5%), and outperforms multiple other baselines. SOSecure operates as a language-agnostic complement to existing LLMs, without requiring retraining or fine-tuning, making it easy to deploy. Our results underscore the importance of maintaining active developer forums, which have dropped substantially in usage with LLM adoptions.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we proposed MES-RAG framework, which enhances entity-specific query handling and provides accurate, secure, and consistent responses. MES-RAG introduces proactive security measures that ensure system integrity by applying protections prior to data access. Additionally, the system supports real-time multi-modal outputs, including text, images, audio, and video, seamlessly integrating into existing RAG architectures. Experimental results demonstrate that MES-RAG significantly improves both accuracy and recall, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing the security and utility of question-answering, increasing accuracy to 0.83 (+0.25) on targeted task.

| **[Privacy-Aware RAG: Secure and Isolated Knowledge Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15548v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in real-world applications has heightened concerns about the confidentiality and integrity of their proprietary knowledge bases. These knowledge bases, which play a critical role in enhancing the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly vulnerable to breaches that could compromise sensitive information. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an advanced encryption methodology designed to protect RAG systems from unauthorized access and data leakage. Our approach encrypts both textual content and its corresponding embeddings prior to storage, ensuring that all data remains securely encrypted. This mechanism restricts access to authorized entities with the appropriate decryption keys, thereby significantly reducing the risk of unintended data exposure. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our encryption strategy preserves the performance and functionality of RAG pipelines, ensuring compatibility across diverse domains and applications. To validate the robustness of our method, we provide comprehensive security proofs that highlight its resilience against potential threats and vulnerabilities. These proofs also reveal limitations in existing approaches, which often lack robustness, adaptability, or reliance on open-source models. Our findings suggest that integrating advanced encryption techniques into the design and deployment of RAG systems can effectively enhance privacy safeguards. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on improving security measures for AI-driven services and advocates for stricter data protection standards within RAG architectures.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advancements, LLMs still face significant challenges in reasoning with structured data, handling dynamic knowledge evolution, and mitigating hallucinations, particularly in mission-critical domains. Our proposed RAG-KG-IL framework addresses these limitations by employing a multi-agent architecture that enables continuous knowledge updates, integrates structured knowledge, and incorporates autonomous agents for enhanced explainability and reasoning. The framework utilizes RAG to ensure the generated responses are grounded in verifiable information, while KGs provide structured domain knowledge for improved consistency and depth of understanding. The Incremental Learning approach allows for dynamic updates to the knowledge base without full retraining, significantly reducing computational overhead and improving the model's adaptability. We evaluate the framework using real-world case studies involving health-related queries, comparing it to state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o and a RAG-only baseline. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces hallucination rates and improves answer completeness and reasoning accuracy. The results underscore the potential of combining RAG, KGs, and multi-agent systems to create intelligent, adaptable systems capable of real-time knowledge integration and reasoning in complex domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taxonomic Reasoning for Rare Arthropods: Combining Dense Image Captioning and RAG for Interpretable Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10886v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of pressing climate change challenges and the significant biodiversity loss among arthropods, automated taxonomic classification from organismal images is a subject of intense research. However, traditional AI pipelines based on deep neural visual architectures such as CNNs or ViTs face limitations such as degraded performance on the long-tail of classes and the inability to reason about their predictions. We integrate image captioning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) to enhance biodiversity monitoring, showing particular promise for characterizing rare and unknown arthropod species. While a naive Vision-Language Model (VLM) excels in classifying images of common species, the RAG model enables classification of rarer taxa by matching explicit textual descriptions of taxonomic features to contextual biodiversity text data from external sources. The RAG model shows promise in reducing overconfidence and enhancing accuracy relative to naive LLMs, suggesting its viability in capturing the nuances of taxonomic hierarchy, particularly at the challenging family and genus levels. Our findings highlight the potential for modern vision-language AI pipelines to support biodiversity conservation initiatives, emphasizing the role of comprehensive data curation and collaboration with citizen science platforms to improve species identification, unknown species characterization and ultimately inform conservation strategies.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |

This paper introduces ClaimTrust, a propagation-based trust scoring framework that dynamically evaluates the reliability of documents in a RAG system. Using a modified PageRank-inspired algorithm, ClaimTrust propagates trust scores across documents based on relationships derived from extracted factual claims. We preprocess and analyze 814 political news articles from Kaggle's Fake News Detection Dataset to extract 2,173 unique claims and classify 965 meaningful relationships (supporting or contradicting). By representing the dataset as a document graph, ClaimTrust iteratively updates trust scores until convergence, effectively differentiating trustworthy articles from unreliable ones. Our methodology, which leverages embedding-based filtering for efficient claim comparison and relationship classification, achieves a 11.2% of significant connections while maintaining computational scalability. Experimental results demonstrate that ClaimTrust successfully assigns higher trust scores to verified documents while penalizing those containing false information. Future directions include fine-tuned claim extract and compare (Li et al., 2022), parameter optimization, enhanced language model utilization, and robust evaluation metrics to generalize the framework across diverse datasets and domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

To effectively assess their video comprehension capabilities, long video understanding benchmarks, such as Video-MME and MLVU, are proposed. However, these benchmarks directly use uniform frame sampling for testing, which results in significant information loss and affects the accuracy of the evaluations in reflecting the true abilities of MLLMs. To address this, we propose RAG-Adapter, a plug-and-play framework that reduces information loss during testing by sampling frames most relevant to the given question. Additionally, we introduce a Grouped-supervised Contrastive Learning (GCL) method to further enhance sampling effectiveness of RAG-Adapter through fine-tuning on our constructed MMAT dataset. Finally, we test numerous baseline MLLMs on various video understanding benchmarks, finding that RAG-Adapter sampling consistently outperforms uniform sampling (e.g., Accuracy of GPT-4o increases by 9.3 percent on Video-MME), providing a more accurate testing method for long video benchmarks.</p></details> | 37 pages, 36 figures |

Predictive maintenance (PdM) in such settings demands methodologies that are adaptive, transferable, and capable of integrating domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we present RAAD-LLM, a novel framework for adaptive anomaly detection, leveraging large language models (LLMs) integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This approach addresses the aforementioned PdM challenges. By effectively utilizing domain-specific knowledge, RAAD-LLM enhances the detection of anomalies in time series data without requiring fine-tuning on specific datasets. The framework's adaptability mechanism enables it to adjust its understanding of normal operating conditions dynamically, thus increasing detection accuracy. We validate this methodology through a real-world application for a plastics manufacturing plant and the Skoltech Anomaly Benchmark (SKAB). Results show significant improvements over our previous model with an accuracy increase from 70.7% to 88.6% on the real-world dataset. By allowing for the enriching of input series data with semantics, RAAD-LLM incorporates multimodal capabilities that facilitate more collaborative decision-making between the model and plant operators. Overall, our findings support RAAD-LLM's ability to revolutionize anomaly detection methodologies in PdM, potentially leading to a paradigm shift in how anomaly detection is implemented across various industries.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2411.00914</p></details> |

To bridge this gap, we introduce OpenRAG, a RAG framework that is optimized end-to-end by tuning the retriever to capture in-context relevance, enabling adaptation to the diverse and evolving needs. Extensive experiments across a wide range of tasks demonstrate that OpenRAG, by tuning a retriever end-to-end, leads to a consistent improvement of 4.0% over the original retriever, consistently outperforming existing state-of-the-art retrievers by 2.1%. Additionally, our results indicate that for some tasks, an end-to-end tuned 0.2B retriever can achieve improvements that surpass those of RAG-oriented or instruction-tuned 8B large language models (LLMs), highlighting the cost-effectiveness of our approach in enhancing RAG systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[OCR Hinders RAG: Evaluating the Cascading Impact of OCR on Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02592v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge to reduce hallucinations and incorporate up-to-date information without retraining. As an essential part of RAG, external knowledge bases are commonly built by extracting structured data from unstructured PDF documents using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However, given the imperfect prediction of OCR and the inherent non-uniform representation of structured data, knowledge bases inevitably contain various OCR noises. In this paper, we introduce OHRBench, the first benchmark for understanding the cascading impact of OCR on RAG systems. OHRBench includes 8,561 carefully selected unstructured document images from seven real-world RAG application domains, along with 8,498 Q&A pairs derived from multimodal elements in documents, challenging existing OCR solutions used for RAG. To better understand OCR's impact on RAG systems, we identify two primary types of OCR noise: Semantic Noise and Formatting Noise and apply perturbation to generate a set of structured data with varying degrees of each OCR noise. Using OHRBench, we first conduct a comprehensive evaluation of current OCR solutions and reveal that none is competent for constructing high-quality knowledge bases for RAG systems. We then systematically evaluate the impact of these two noise types and demonstrate the trend relationship between the degree of OCR noise and RAG performance. Our OHRBench, including PDF documents, Q&As, and the ground truth structured data are released at: https://github.com/opendatalab/OHR-Bench</p></details> | Work in progress |

We demonstrate that RAG systems that operate on databases with untrusted content are vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks we call jamming. An adversary can add a single ``blocker'' document to the database that will be retrieved in response to a specific query and result in the RAG system not answering this query, ostensibly because it lacks relevant information or because the answer is unsafe. We describe and measure the efficacy of several methods for generating blocker documents, including a new method based on black-box optimization. Our method (1) does not rely on instruction injection, (2) does not require the adversary to know the embedding or LLM used by the target RAG system, and (3) does not employ an auxiliary LLM. We evaluate jamming attacks on several embeddings and LLMs and demonstrate that the existing safety metrics for LLMs do not capture their vulnerability to jamming. We then discuss defenses against blocker documents.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in USENIX Security Symposium 2025</p></details> |

However, the specialized nature of biochemical data often necessitates costly domain-specific fine-tuning, posing critical challenges. First, it hinders the application of more flexible general-purpose LLMs in cutting-edge drug discovery tasks. More importantly, it impedes the rapid integration of the vast amounts of scientific data continuously generated through experiments and research. To investigate these challenges, we propose CLADD, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-empowered agentic system tailored to drug discovery tasks. Through the collaboration of multiple LLM agents, CLADD dynamically retrieves information from biomedical knowledge bases, contextualizes query molecules, and integrates relevant evidence to generate responses -- all without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. Crucially, we tackle key obstacles in applying RAG workflows to biochemical data, including data heterogeneity, ambiguity, and multi-source integration. We demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of this framework across a variety of drug discovery tasks, showing that it outperforms general-purpose and domain-specific LLMs as well as traditional deep learning approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Machi...</summary><p>Machine Learning, Drug Discovery</p></details> |

However, these modules are usually separately trained. We argue that a system like RAG that incorporates multiple modules should be jointly optimized to achieve optimal performance. To demonstrate this, we design a specific pipeline called \textbf{SmartRAG} that includes a policy network and a retriever. The policy network can serve as 1) a decision maker that decides when to retrieve, 2) a query rewriter to generate a query most suited to the retriever, and 3) an answer generator that produces the final response with/without the observations. We then propose to jointly optimize the whole system using a reinforcement learning algorithm, with the reward designed to encourage the system to achieve the best performance with minimal retrieval cost. When jointly optimized, all the modules can be aware of how other modules are working and thus find the best way to work together as a complete system. Empirical results demonstrate that the jointly optimized SmartRAG can achieve better performance than separately optimized counterparts.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution to enhance LLMs accuracy by incorporating external knowledge. However, traditional RAG systems struggle with processing complex relational information and multi-step reasoning, limiting their effectiveness in advanced problem-solving tasks. To address these limitations, we propose CogGRAG, a cognition inspired graph-based RAG framework, designed to improve LLMs performance in Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA). Inspired by the human cognitive process of decomposing complex problems and performing self-verification, our framework introduces a three-stage methodology: decomposition, retrieval, and reasoning with self-verification. By integrating these components, CogGRAG enhances the accuracy of LLMs in complex problem solving. We conduct systematic experiments with three LLM backbones on four benchmark datasets, where CogGRAG outperforms the baselines.</p></details> |  |

While RAG enhances MLLMs by grounding responses in query-relevant external knowledge, this reliance poses a critical yet underexplored safety risk: knowledge poisoning attacks, where misinformation or irrelevant knowledge is intentionally injected into external knowledge bases to manipulate model outputs to be incorrect and even harmful. To expose such vulnerabilities in multimodal RAG, we propose MM-PoisonRAG, a novel knowledge poisoning attack framework with two attack strategies: Localized Poisoning Attack (LPA), which injects query-specific misinformation in both text and images for targeted manipulation, and Globalized Poisoning Attack (GPA) to provide false guidance during MLLM generation to elicit nonsensical responses across all queries. We evaluate our attacks across multiple tasks, models, and access settings, demonstrating that LPA successfully manipulates the MLLM to generate attacker-controlled answers, with a success rate of up to 56% on MultiModalQA. Moreover, GPA completely disrupts model generation to 0% accuracy with just a single irrelevant knowledge injection. Our results highlight the urgent need for robust defenses against knowledge poisoning to safeguard multimodal RAG frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/HyeonjeongHa/MM-PoisonRAG</p></details> |

Although these speech act indicators communicate the user\textquotesingle s intent -- whether it is asking a question, making a request, or stating a fact -- they do not necessarily add to the core informational content of the query itself. This paper investigates whether extracting the underlying propositional content from user utterances -- essentially stripping away the linguistic markers of intent -- can improve retrieval quality in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Drawing upon foundational insights from speech act theory, we propose a practical method for automatically transforming queries into their propositional equivalents before embedding. To assess the efficacy of this approach, we conducted an experimental study involving 63 user queries related to a Brazilian telecommunications news corpus with precomputed semantic embeddings. Results demonstrate clear improvements in semantic similarity between query embeddings and document embeddings at top ranks, confirming that queries stripped of speech act indicators more effectively retrieve relevant content.</p></details> | 19 pages, 4 figures |

Built from heterologous data of NASDAQ 100 companies, FinTMMBench offers three significant advantages. 1) Multi-modal Corpus: It encompasses a hybrid of financial tables, news articles, daily stock prices, and visual technical charts as the corpus. 2) Temporal-aware Questions: Each question requires the retrieval and interpretation of its relevant data over a specific time period, including daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual periods. 3) Diverse Financial Analysis Tasks: The questions involve 10 different tasks, including information extraction, trend analysis, sentiment analysis and event detection, etc. We further propose a novel TMMHybridRAG method, which first leverages LLMs to convert data from other modalities (e.g., tabular, visual and time-series data) into textual format and then incorporates temporal information in each node when constructing graphs and dense indexes. Its effectiveness has been validated in extensive experiments, but notable gaps remain, highlighting the challenges presented by our FinTMMBench.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Beyond RAG: Task-Aware KV Cache Compression for Comprehensive Knowledge Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04973v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incorporating external knowledge in large language models (LLMs) enhances their utility across diverse applications, but existing methods have trade-offs. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) fetches evidence via similarity search, but key information may fall outside top ranked results. Long-context models can process multiple documents but are computationally expensive and limited by context window size. Inspired by students condensing study material for open-book exams, we propose task-aware key-value (KV) cache compression, which compresses external knowledge in a zero- or few-shot setup. This enables LLMs to reason efficiently over a compacted representation of all relevant information. Experiments show our approach outperforms both RAG and task-agnostic compression methods. On LongBench v2, it improves accuracy by up to 7 absolute points over RAG with a 30x compression rate, while reducing inference latency from 0.43s to 0.16s. A synthetic dataset highlights that RAG performs well when sparse evidence suffices, whereas task-aware compression is superior for broad knowledge tasks.</p></details> |  |

Although previous studies noted that retrieving many documents can degrade performance, they did not isolate how the quantity of documents affects performance while controlling for context length. We evaluate various language models on custom datasets derived from a multi-hop QA task. We keep the context length and position of relevant information constant while varying the number of documents, and find that increasing the document count in RAG settings poses significant challenges for LLMs. Additionally, our results indicate that processing multiple documents is a separate challenge from handling long contexts. We also make the datasets and code available: https://github.com/shaharl6000/MoreDocsSameLen .</p></details> | Preprint |

A number of graph-based RAG methods have been proposed in the literature. However, these methods have not been systematically and comprehensively compared under the same experimental settings. In this paper, we first summarize a unified framework to incorporate all graph-based RAG methods from a high-level perspective. We then extensively compare representative graph-based RAG methods over a range of questing-answering (QA) datasets -- from specific questions to abstract questions -- and examine the effectiveness of all methods, providing a thorough analysis of graph-based RAG approaches. As a byproduct of our experimental analysis, we are also able to identify new variants of the graph-based RAG methods over specific QA and abstract QA tasks respectively, by combining existing techniques, which outperform the state-of-the-art methods. Finally, based on these findings, we offer promising research opportunities. We believe that a deeper understanding of the behavior of existing methods can provide new valuable insights for future research.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers an effective method for achieving this by retrieving the most relevant fragments into LLMs. However, the advancements in context window size for LLMs offer an alternative approach, raising the question of whether RAG remains necessary for effectively handling external knowledge. Several existing studies provide inconclusive comparisons between RAG and long-context (LC) LLMs, largely due to limitations in the benchmark designs. In this paper, we present LaRA, a novel benchmark specifically designed to rigorously compare RAG and LC LLMs. LaRA encompasses 2326 test cases across four practical QA task categories and three types of naturally occurring long texts. Through systematic evaluation of seven open-source and four proprietary LLMs, we find that the optimal choice between RAG and LC depends on a complex interplay of factors, including the model's parameter size, long-text capabilities, context length, task type, and the characteristics of the retrieved chunks. Our findings provide actionable guidelines for practitioners to effectively leverage both RAG and LC approaches in developing and deploying LLM applications.

While many studies focus on evaluating the overall quality of end-to-end RAG systems, there is a gap in understanding the appropriateness of LLMs for the RAG task. To address this, we introduce Trust-Score, a holistic metric that evaluates the trustworthiness of LLMs within the RAG framework. Our results show that various prompting methods, such as in-context learning, fail to effectively adapt LLMs to the RAG task as measured by Trust-Score. Consequently, we propose Trust-Align, a method to align LLMs for improved Trust-Score performance. 26 out of 27 models aligned using Trust-Align substantially outperform competitive baselines on ASQA, QAMPARI, and ELI5. Specifically, in LLaMA-3-8b, Trust-Align outperforms FRONT on ASQA (up 12.56), QAMPARI (up 36.04), and ELI5 (up 17.69). Trust-Align also significantly enhances models' ability to correctly refuse and provide quality citations. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of Trust-Align across different open-weight models, including the LLaMA series (1b to 8b), Qwen-2.5 series (0.5b to 7b), and Phi3.5 (3.8b).

However, evaluating the effectiveness of RAG systems in specialized scenarios remains challenging due to the high costs of data construction and the lack of suitable evaluation metrics. This paper introduces RAGEval, a framework designed to assess RAG systems across diverse scenarios by generating high-quality documents, questions, answers, and references through a schema-based pipeline. With a focus on factual accuracy, we propose three novel metrics: Completeness, Hallucination, and Irrelevance to evaluate LLM generated responses rigorously. Experimental results show that RAGEval outperforms zero-shot and one-shot methods in terms of clarity, safety, conformity, and richness of generated samples. Furthermore, the use of LLMs for scoring the proposed metrics demonstrates a high level of consistency with human evaluations. RAGEval establishes a new paradigm for evaluating RAG systems in real-world applications.

| **[SAGE: A Framework of Precise Retrieval for RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01713v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated significant proficiency in conducting question-answering (QA) tasks within a specified corpus. Nonetheless, numerous failure instances of RAG in QA still exist. These failures are not solely attributable to the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs); instead, they predominantly arise from the retrieval of inaccurate information for LLMs due to two limitations: (1) Current RAG methods segment the corpus without considering semantics, making it difficult to find relevant context due to impaired correlation between questions and the segments. (2) There is a trade-off between missing essential context with fewer context retrieved and getting irrelevant context with more context retrieved. In this paper, we introduce a RAG framework (SAGE), to overcome these limitations. First, to address the segmentation issue without considering semantics, we propose to train a semantic segmentation model. This model is trained to segment the corpus into semantically complete chunks. Second, to ensure that only the most relevant chunks are retrieved while the irrelevant ones are ignored, we design a chunk selection algorithm to dynamically select chunks based on the decreasing speed of the relevance score, leading to a more relevant selection. Third, to further ensure the precision of the retrieved chunks, we propose letting LLMs assess whether retrieved chunks are excessive or lacking and then adjust the amount of context accordingly. Experiments show that SAGE outperforms baselines by 61.25% in the quality of QA on average. Moreover, by avoiding retrieving noisy context, SAGE lowers the cost of the tokens consumed in LLM inference and achieves a 49.41% enhancement in cost efficiency on average. Additionally, our work offers valuable insights for boosting RAG.</p></details> |  |

To overcome the limitations of existing methods, this paper shifts away from prior dedicated heuristic approaches and revisits the most fundamental idea to HR perception by enhancing the long-context capability of MLLMs, driven by recent advances in long-context techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for general LLMs. Towards this end, this paper presents the first study exploring the use of RAG to address HR perception challenges. Specifically, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Perception (RAP), a training-free framework that retrieves and fuses relevant image crops while preserving spatial context using the proposed Spatial-Awareness Layout. To accommodate different tasks, the proposed Retrieved-Exploration Search (RE-Search) dynamically selects the optimal number of crops based on model confidence and retrieval scores. Experimental results on HR benchmarks demonstrate the significant effectiveness of RAP, with LLaVA-v1.5-13B achieving a 43% improvement on $V^*$ Bench and 19% on HR-Bench.</p></details> |  |

Recent progress in Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) has opened up new possibilities for interactive diagnostic tools. However, these models often suffer from factual hallucination, which can lead to incorrect diagnoses. Fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have emerged as methods to address these issues. However, the amount of high-quality data and distribution shifts between training data and deployment data limit the application of fine-tuning methods. Although RAG is lightweight and effective, existing RAG-based approaches are not sufficiently general to different medical domains and can potentially cause misalignment issues, both between modalities and between the model and the ground truth. In this paper, we propose a versatile multimodal RAG system, MMed-RAG, designed to enhance the factuality of Med-LVLMs. Our approach introduces a domain-aware retrieval mechanism, an adaptive retrieved contexts selection method, and a provable RAG-based preference fine-tuning strategy. These innovations make the RAG process sufficiently general and reliable, significantly improving alignment when introducing retrieved contexts. Experimental results across five medical datasets (involving radiology, ophthalmology, pathology) on medical VQA and report generation demonstrate that MMed-RAG can achieve an average improvement of 43.8% in the factual accuracy of Med-LVLMs. Our data and code are available in https://github.com/richard-peng-xia/MMed-RAG.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

In this paper, we propose a generative AI-powered GATE question-answering framework (GATE stands for Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering) that leverages LLMs to explain GATE solutions and support students in their exam preparation. We conducted extensive benchmarking to select the optimal embedding model and LLM, evaluating our framework based on criteria such as latency, faithfulness, and relevance, with additional validation through human evaluation. Our chatbot integrates state-of-the-art embedding models and LLMs to deliver accurate, context-aware responses. Through rigorous experimentation, we identified configurations that balance performance and computational efficiency, ensuring a reliable chatbot to serve students' needs. Additionally, we discuss the challenges faced in data processing and modeling and implemented solutions. Our work explores the application of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for GATE Q/A explanation tasks, and our findings demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and response quality.

| **[Post-training an LLM for RAG? Train on Self-Generated Demonstrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10596v2)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with knowledge intensive NLP tasks, such as answering "Who won the latest World Cup?" because the knowledge they learn during training may be insufficient or outdated. Conditioning generation on retrieved documents -- a technique known as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) -- mitigates these shortcomings by allowing the model to leverage in-context information. Practitioners can improve LLM RAG performance by fine-tuning on retrieval-augmented instructions, but must beware that this can cause undesirable model behaviors like hallucinations. We attribute this degradation to the fact that the training data is likely to be out-of-distribution for the model and may suffer from quality issues, such as misalignment between retrievals and target responses (since retrievals are frequently added post-hoc). We propose a recipe for training RAG-enabled LLMs using self-generated demonstrations, thereby avoiding training on out-of-distribution text and integrating retrievals into the LLM responses. We evaluate our method on knowledge intensive question answering (QA) tasks and show that our method teaches LLMs to properly handle in-context retrievals and abstain from questions it will likely get wrong. Compared to conventional RA-IT methods, our method prevents model degradation in non-RAG settings while exhibiting superior QA performance.</p></details> |  |

To address the fragmented evaluation paradigms and limited cases in existing Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH), this paper introduces U-NIAH, a unified framework that systematically compares LLMs and RAG methods in controlled long context settings. Our framework extends beyond traditional NIAH by incorporating multi-needle, long-needle, and needle-in-needle configurations, along with different retrieval settings, while leveraging the synthetic Starlight Academy dataset-a fictional magical universe-to eliminate biases from pre-trained knowledge. Through extensive experiments, we investigate three research questions: (1) performance trade-offs between LLMs and RAG, (2) error patterns in RAG, and (3) RAG's limitations in complex settings. Our findings show that RAG significantly enhances smaller LLMs by mitigating the "lost-in-the-middle" effect and improving robustness, achieving an 82.58% win-rate over LLMs. However, we observe that retrieval noise and reverse chunk ordering degrade performance, while surprisingly, advanced reasoning LLMs exhibit reduced RAG compatibility due to sensitivity to semantic distractors. We identify typical error patterns including omission due to noise, hallucination under high noise critical condition, and self-doubt behaviors. Our work not only highlights the complementary roles of RAG and LLMs, but also provides actionable insights for optimizing deployments.

However, these models face challenges in retrieving precise information from vast datasets. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) was developed to combining LLMs with external information retrieval systems to enhance the accuracy and context of responses. Despite improvements, RAG still struggles with comprehensive retrieval in high-volume, low-information-density databases and lacks relational awareness, leading to fragmented answers. To address this, this paper introduces the Pseudo-Knowledge Graph (PKG) framework, designed to overcome these limitations by integrating Meta-path Retrieval, In-graph Text and Vector Retrieval into LLMs. By preserving natural language text and leveraging various retrieval techniques, the PKG offers a richer knowledge representation and improves accuracy in information retrieval. Extensive evaluations using Open Compass and MultiHop-RAG benchmarks demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in managing large volumes of data and complex relationships.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods rely on unrealistic white-box assumptions, such as attackers having access to RAG systems' internal processes. To address this issue, we introduce a realistic black-box attack scenario based on the RAG paradox, where RAG systems inadvertently expose vulnerabilities while attempting to enhance trustworthiness. Because RAG systems reference external documents during response generation, our attack targets these sources without requiring internal access. Our approach first identifies the external sources disclosed by RAG systems and then automatically generates poisoned documents with misinformation designed to match these sources. Finally, these poisoned documents are newly published on the disclosed sources, disrupting the RAG system's response generation process. Both offline and online experiments confirm that this attack significantly reduces RAG performance without requiring internal access. Furthermore, from an insider perspective within the RAG system, we propose a re-ranking method that acts as a fundamental safeguard, offering minimal protection against unforeseen attacks.</p></details> |  |

Different from traditional RAG methods that mostly deal with flat text chunks, the proposed method takes into account the relationship of multimodalities by using a graph structure. To do that, a graph modeling structure is defined based on document layout parsing. The structure of an input document is retained with the connection of text chunks, tables, and figures. This representation allows the method to handle complex questions that require information from multimodalities. To confirm the efficiency of the graph modeling, a flexible RAG pipeline is developed using robust components. Experimental results on four benchmark test sets confirm the contribution of the layout-aware modeling for performance improvement of the RAG pipeline.</p></details> | <details><summary>NAACL...</summary><p>NAACL 2025, Industry Track</p></details> |

Recent RAG advancements focus on improving retrieval outcomes through iterative LLM refinement or self-critique capabilities acquired through additional instruction tuning of LLMs. In this work, we introduce Speculative RAG - a framework that leverages a larger generalist LM to efficiently verify multiple RAG drafts produced in parallel by a smaller, distilled specialist LM. Each draft is generated from a distinct subset of retrieved documents, offering diverse perspectives on the evidence while reducing input token counts per draft. This approach enhances comprehension of each subset and mitigates potential position bias over long context. Our method accelerates RAG by delegating drafting to the smaller specialist LM, with the larger generalist LM performing a single verification pass over the drafts.

| **[OntologyRAG: Better and Faster Biomedical Code Mapping with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Leveraging Ontology Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18992v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biomedical ontologies, which comprehensively define concepts and relations for biomedical entities, are crucial for structuring and formalizing domain-specific information representations. Biomedical code mapping identifies similarity or equivalence between concepts from different ontologies. Obtaining high-quality mapping usually relies on automatic generation of unrefined mapping with ontology domain fine-tuned language models (LMs), followed by manual selections or corrections by coding experts who have extensive domain expertise and familiarity with ontology schemas. The LMs usually provide unrefined code mapping suggestions as a list of candidates without reasoning or supporting evidence, hence coding experts still need to verify each suggested candidate against ontology sources to pick the best matches. This is also a recurring task as ontology sources are updated regularly to incorporate new research findings. Consequently, the need of regular LM retraining and manual refinement make code mapping time-consuming and labour intensive. In this work, we created OntologyRAG, an ontology-enhanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method that leverages the inductive biases from ontological knowledge graphs for in-context-learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs). Our solution grounds LLMs to knowledge graphs with unrefined mappings between ontologies and processes questions by generating an interpretable set of results that include prediction rational with mapping proximity assessment. Our solution doesn't require re-training LMs, as all ontology updates could be reflected by updating the knowledge graphs with a standard process. Evaluation results on a self-curated gold dataset show promises of using our method to enable coding experts to achieve better and faster code mapping. The code is available at https://github.com/iqvianlp/ontologyRAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted as a workshop paper for KEIR@ECIR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Faster, Cheaper, Better: Multi-Objective Hyperparameter Optimization for LLM and RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18635v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a popular technique for improving Large Language Model (LLM) systems, it introduces a large number of choices, parameters and hyperparameters that must be made or tuned. This includes the LLM, embedding, and ranker models themselves, as well as hyperparameters governing individual RAG components. Yet, collectively optimizing the entire configuration in a RAG or LLM system remains under-explored - especially in multi-objective settings - due to intractably large solution spaces, noisy objective evaluations, and the high cost of evaluations. In this work, we introduce the first approach for multi-objective parameter optimization of cost, latency, safety and alignment over entire LLM and RAG systems. We find that Bayesian optimization methods significantly outperform baseline approaches, obtaining a superior Pareto front on two new RAG benchmark tasks. We conclude our work with important considerations for practitioners who are designing multi-objective RAG systems, highlighting nuances such as how optimal configurations may not generalize across tasks and objectives.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ward: Provable RAG Dataset Inference via LLM Watermarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03537v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RAG enables LLMs to easily incorporate external data, raising concerns for data owners regarding unauthorized usage of their content. The challenge of detecting such unauthorized usage remains underexplored, with datasets and methods from adjacent fields being ill-suited for its study. We take several steps to bridge this gap. First, we formalize this problem as (black-box) RAG Dataset Inference (RAG-DI). We then introduce a novel dataset designed for realistic benchmarking of RAG-DI methods, alongside a set of baselines. Finally, we propose Ward, a method for RAG-DI based on LLM watermarks that equips data owners with rigorous statistical guarantees regarding their dataset's misuse in RAG corpora. Ward consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving higher accuracy, superior query efficiency and robustness. Our work provides a foundation for future studies of RAG-DI and highlights LLM watermarks as a promising approach to this problem.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[Towards Fair RAG: On the Impact of Fair Ranking in Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11598v3)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern language models frequently include retrieval components to improve their outputs, giving rise to a growing number of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. Yet, most existing work in RAG has underemphasized fair ranking techniques and neglected the diverse interests of all stakeholders. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of RAG systems that incorporate fairness-aware rankings, focusing on both ranking fairness and attribution fairness - ensuring equitable exposure of sources cited in the final text. We specifically examine item-side fairness, i.e., whether retrieved documents receive balanced exposure, and assess how this affects both the system's overall performance and the eventual distribution of cited sources. Across twelve RAG models and seven tasks, we find that fairness-aware retrieval frequently retains or even improves ranking effectiveness and generation quality, countering the widespread belief that fairness compromises system performance. Moreover, we show that fair retrieval leads to more balanced attribution in the final responses, ensuring that the cited sources are credited more equitably. Our results underscore the importance of item-side fairness throughout both retrieval and generation phases, offering key insights for building more responsible and equitable RAG systems and illustrating promising avenues for future exploration in fair ranking and source attribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Top 5...</summary><p>Top 5 Spotlight at AFME Workshop at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating the Effectiveness and Efficiency of Demonstration Retrievers in RAG for Coding Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09662v2)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge bases, achieving state-of-the-art results in various coding tasks. The core of RAG is retrieving demonstration examples, which is essential to balance effectiveness (generation quality) and efficiency (retrieval time) for optimal performance. However, the high-dimensional nature of code representations and large knowledge bases often create efficiency bottlenecks, which are overlooked in previous research. This paper systematically evaluates the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off of retrievers across three coding tasks: Program Synthesis, Commit Message Generation, and Assertion Generation. We examined six retrievers: two sparse (BM25 and BM25L) and four dense retrievers, including one exhaustive dense retriever (SBERT's Semantic Search) and three approximate dense retrievers (ANNOY, LSH, and HNSW). Our findings show that while BM25 excels in effectiveness, it suffers in efficiency as the knowledge base grows beyond 1000 entries. In large-scale retrieval, efficiency differences become more pronounced, with approximate dense retrievers offering the greatest gains. For instance, in Commit Generation task, HNSW achieves a 44x speed up, while only with a 1.74% drop in RougeL compared with BM25. Our results also show that increasing the number of demonstrations in the prompt doesn't always improve the effectiveness and can increase latency and lead to incorrect outputs. Our findings provide valuable insights for practitioners aiming to build efficient and effective RAG systems for coding tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables, accepted by SANER 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we study the conflict between biases of each component and their relationship to the overall bias of the RAG system, which we call bias conflict. Examining both gender and political biases as case studies, we show that bias conflict can be characterized through a linear relationship among components despite its complexity in 6 different LLMs. Through comprehensive fine-tuning experiments creating 120 differently biased embedders, we demonstrate how to control bias while maintaining utility and reveal the importance of reverse-biasing the embedder to mitigate bias in the overall system. Additionally, we find that LLMs and tasks exhibit varying sensitivities to the embedder bias, a crucial factor to consider for debiasing. Our results underscore that a fair RAG system can be better achieved by carefully controlling the bias of the embedder rather than increasing its fairness.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages (8 main), 12 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

We present LettuceDetect a framework that addresses two critical limitations in existing hallucination detection methods: (1) the context window constraints of traditional encoder-based methods, and (2) the computational inefficiency of LLM based approaches. Building on ModernBERT's extended context capabilities (up to 8k tokens) and trained on the RAGTruth benchmark dataset, our approach outperforms all previous encoder-based models and most prompt-based models, while being approximately 30 times smaller than the best models. LettuceDetect is a token-classification model that processes context-question-answer triples, allowing for the identification of unsupported claims at the token level. Evaluations on the RAGTruth corpus demonstrate an F1 score of 79.22% for example-level detection, which is a 14.8% improvement over Luna, the previous state-of-the-art encoder-based architecture. Additionally, the system can process 30 to 60 examples per second on a single GPU, making it more practical for real-world RAG applications.</p></details> | 6 pages |
| **[Don't Do RAG: When Cache-Augmented Generation is All You Need for Knowledge Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15605v2)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has gained traction as a powerful approach for enhancing language models by integrating external knowledge sources. However, RAG introduces challenges such as retrieval latency, potential errors in document selection, and increased system complexity. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) featuring significantly extended context windows, this paper proposes an alternative paradigm, cache-augmented generation (CAG) that bypasses real-time retrieval. Our method involves preloading all relevant resources, especially when the documents or knowledge for retrieval are of a limited and manageable size, into the LLM's extended context and caching its runtime parameters. During inference, the model utilizes these preloaded parameters to answer queries without additional retrieval steps. Comparative analyses reveal that CAG eliminates retrieval latency and minimizes retrieval errors while maintaining context relevance. Performance evaluations across multiple benchmarks highlight scenarios where long-context LLMs either outperform or complement traditional RAG pipelines. These findings suggest that, for certain applications, particularly those with a constrained knowledge base, CAG provide a streamlined and efficient alternative to RAG, achieving comparable or superior results with reduced complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, accepted by the Web Conference 2025 (WWW '25) as a short paper</p></details> |
| **[Worse than Zero-shot? A Fact-Checking Dataset for Evaluating the Robustness of RAG Against Misleading Retrievals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16101v1)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has shown impressive capabilities in mitigating hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs struggle to handle misleading retrievals and often fail to maintain their own reasoning when exposed to conflicting or selectively-framed evidence, making them vulnerable to real-world misinformation. In such real-world retrieval scenarios, misleading and conflicting information is rampant, particularly in the political domain, where evidence is often selectively framed, incomplete, or polarized. However, existing RAG benchmarks largely assume a clean retrieval setting, where models succeed by accurately retrieving and generating answers from gold-standard documents. This assumption fails to align with real-world conditions, leading to an overestimation of RAG system performance. To bridge this gap, we introduce RAGuard, a fact-checking dataset designed to evaluate the robustness of RAG systems against misleading retrievals. Unlike prior benchmarks that rely on synthetic noise, our dataset constructs its retrieval corpus from Reddit discussions, capturing naturally occurring misinformation. It categorizes retrieved evidence into three types: supporting, misleading, and irrelevant, providing a realistic and challenging testbed for assessing how well RAG systems navigate different retrieval information. Our benchmark experiments reveal that when exposed to misleading retrievals, all tested LLM-powered RAG systems perform worse than their zero-shot baselines (i.e., no retrieval at all), highlighting their susceptibility to noisy environments. To the best of our knowledge, RAGuard is the first benchmark to systematically assess RAG robustness against misleading evidence. We expect this benchmark will drive future research toward improving RAG systems beyond idealized datasets, making them more reliable for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Documents to Dialogue: Building KG-RAG Enhanced AI Assistants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15237v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Adobe Experience Platform AI Assistant is a conversational tool that enables organizations to interact seamlessly with proprietary enterprise data through a chatbot. However, due to access restrictions, Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot retrieve these internal documents, limiting their ability to generate accurate zero-shot responses. To overcome this limitation, we use a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework powered by a Knowledge Graph (KG) to retrieve relevant information from external knowledge sources, enabling LLMs to answer questions over private or previously unseen document collections. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for building a high-quality, low-noise KG. We apply several techniques, including incremental entity resolution using seed concepts, similarity-based filtering to deduplicate entries, assigning confidence scores to entity-relation pairs to filter for high-confidence pairs, and linking facts to source documents for provenance. Our KG-RAG system retrieves relevant tuples, which are added to the user prompts context before being sent to the LLM generating the response. Our evaluation demonstrates that this approach significantly enhances response relevance, reducing irrelevant answers by over 50% and increasing fully relevant answers by 88% compared to the existing production system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain-of-Rank: Enhancing Large Language Models for Domain-Specific RAG in Edge Device](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15134v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) is especially valuable in specialized domains, where precision is critical. To more specialize the LLMs into a target domain, domain-specific RAG has recently been developed by allowing the LLM to access the target domain early via finetuning. The domain-specific RAG makes more sense in resource-constrained environments like edge devices, as they should perform a specific task (e.g. personalization) reliably using only small-scale LLMs. While the domain-specific RAG is well-aligned with edge devices in this respect, it often relies on widely-used reasoning techniques like chain-of-thought (CoT). The reasoning step is useful to understand the given external knowledge, and yet it is computationally expensive and difficult for small-scale LLMs to learn it. Tackling this, we propose the Chain of Rank (CoR) which shifts the focus from intricate lengthy reasoning to simple ranking of the reliability of input external documents. Then, CoR reduces computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy, making it particularly suited for resource-constrained environments. We attain the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in benchmarks, and analyze its efficacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>NAACL...</summary><p>NAACL 2025 (Findings)</p></details> |

Different from a standard retrieval task's objective of maximising the relevance of a set of top-ranked documents, a RAG system's objective is rather to maximise their total utility, where the utility of a document indicates whether including it as a part of the additional contextual information in an LLM prompt improves a downstream task. Existing studies investigate the role of the relevance of a RAG context for knowledge-intensive language tasks (KILT), where relevance essentially takes the form of answer containment. In contrast, in our work, relevance corresponds to that of topical overlap between a query and a document for an information seeking task. Specifically, we make use of an IR test collection to empirically investigate whether a RAG context comprised of topically relevant documents leads to improved downstream performance. Our experiments lead to the following findings: (a) there is a small positive correlation between relevance and utility; (b) this correlation decreases with increasing context sizes (higher values of k in k-shot); and (c) a more effective retrieval model generally leads to better downstream RAG performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages (including reference), 5 figures, 1 table, 48 references; this paper has been accepted by ECIR'25 as a full paper</p></details> |

Our approach combines RAG with Socratic dialogue to align a user's intuitive understanding of research topics with established Knowledge Organization Systems (KOSs). The proposed approach will effectively bridge "little semantics" (domain-specific KOS structures) with "big semantics" (broad bibliometric repositories), making complex academic taxonomies more accessible. Such agents have the potential for broad use. We illustrate with a sample application called CollabNext, which is a person-centric knowledge graph connecting people, organizations, and research topics. We further describe how the application design has an intentional focus on HBCUs and emerging researchers to raise visibility of people historically rendered invisible in the current science system.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, AAAI 2025 Workshop on A Translational Institute for Knowledge Axiomatization</p></details> |

Given the challenges in continual learning with large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become the dominant way to introduce new information. However, its reliance on vector retrieval hinders its ability to mimic the dynamic and interconnected nature of human long-term memory. Recent RAG approaches augment vector embeddings with various structures like knowledge graphs to address some of these gaps, namely sense-making and associativity. However, their performance on more basic factual memory tasks drops considerably below standard RAG. We address this unintended deterioration and propose HippoRAG 2, a framework that outperforms standard RAG comprehensively on factual, sense-making, and associative memory tasks. HippoRAG 2 builds upon the Personalized PageRank algorithm used in HippoRAG and enhances it with deeper passage integration and more effective online use of an LLM. This combination pushes this RAG system closer to the effectiveness of human long-term memory, achieving a 7% improvement in associative memory tasks over the state-of-the-art embedding model while also exhibiting superior factual knowledge and sense-making memory capabilities. This work paves the way for non-parametric continual learning for LLMs. Our code and data will be released at https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/HippoRAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data to be released at: https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/HippoRAG</p></details> |

However, when the retrieval process involves private data, RAG systems may face severe privacy risks, potentially leading to the leakage of sensitive information. To address this issue, we propose using synthetic data as a privacy-preserving alternative for the retrieval data. We propose SAGE, a novel two-stage synthetic data generation paradigm. In the stage-1, we employ an attribute-based extraction and generation approach to preserve key contextual information from the original data. In the stage-2, we further enhance the privacy properties of the synthetic data through an agent-based iterative refinement process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that using our synthetic data as the retrieval context achieves comparable performance to using the original data while substantially reducing privacy risks. Our work takes the first step towards investigating the possibility of generating high-utility and privacy-preserving synthetic data for RAG, opening up new opportunities for the safe application of RAG systems in various domains.</p></details> |  |

This is critical given existing workforce shortages, especially in marginalized communities like Underrepresented Minorities (URM), who often lack access to quality education. Addressing these challenges, this research presents gAI-PT4I4, a Generative AI-based Personalized Tutor for Industrial 4.0, designed to personalize 4IR experiential learning. gAI-PT4I4 employs sentiment analysis to assess student comprehension, leveraging generative AI and finite automaton to tailor learning experiences. The framework integrates low-fidelity Digital Twins for VR-based training, featuring an Interactive Tutor - a generative AI assistant providing real-time guidance via audio and text. It uses zero-shot sentiment analysis with LLMs and prompt engineering, achieving 86\% accuracy in classifying student-teacher interactions as positive or negative. Additionally, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables personalized learning content grounded in domain-specific knowledge. To adapt training dynamically, finite automaton structures exercises into states of increasing difficulty, requiring 80\% task-performance accuracy for progression. Experimental evaluation with 22 volunteers showed improved accuracy exceeding 80\%, reducing training time. Finally, this paper introduces a Multi-Fidelity Digital Twin model, aligning Digital Twin complexity with Bloom's Taxonomy and Kirkpatrick's model, providing a scalable educational framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Local to Global: A Graph RAG Approach to Query-Focused Summarization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16130v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to retrieve relevant information from an external knowledge source enables large language models (LLMs) to answer questions over private and/or previously unseen document collections. However, RAG fails on global questions directed at an entire text corpus, such as "What are the main themes in the dataset?", since this is inherently a query-focused summarization (QFS) task, rather than an explicit retrieval task. Prior QFS methods, meanwhile, do not scale to the quantities of text indexed by typical RAG systems. To combine the strengths of these contrasting methods, we propose GraphRAG, a graph-based approach to question answering over private text corpora that scales with both the generality of user questions and the quantity of source text. Our approach uses an LLM to build a graph index in two stages: first, to derive an entity knowledge graph from the source documents, then to pregenerate community summaries for all groups of closely related entities. Given a question, each community summary is used to generate a partial response, before all partial responses are again summarized in a final response to the user. For a class of global sensemaking questions over datasets in the 1 million token range, we show that GraphRAG leads to substantial improvements over a conventional RAG baseline for both the comprehensiveness and diversity of generated answers.</p></details> |  |

To comprehensively evaluate the resilience of current RAG methods, we introduce HawkBench, a human-labeled, multi-domain benchmark designed to rigorously assess RAG performance across categorized task types. By stratifying tasks based on information-seeking behaviors, HawkBench provides a systematic evaluation of how well RAG systems adapt to diverse user needs. Unlike existing benchmarks, which focus primarily on specific task types (mostly factoid queries) and rely on varying knowledge bases, HawkBench offers: (1) systematic task stratification to cover a broad range of query types, including both factoid and rationale queries, (2) integration of multi-domain corpora across all task types to mitigate corpus bias, and (3) rigorous annotation for high-quality evaluation. HawkBench includes 1,600 high-quality test samples, evenly distributed across domains and task types. Using this benchmark, we evaluate representative RAG methods, analyzing their performance in terms of answer quality and response latency. Our findings highlight the need for dynamic task strategies that integrate decision-making, query interpretation, and global knowledge understanding to improve RAG generalizability. We believe HawkBench serves as a pivotal benchmark for advancing the resilience of RAG methods and their ability to achieve general-purpose information seeking.</p></details> | 13 pages |

It has been shown to enhance both generation quality and trustworthiness. While numerous works have focused on improving retrieval, generation, and evaluation, the role of reward models in reinforcement learning for optimizing RAG remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{RAG-Reward}, a framework designed to develop reward models to enable \textit{hallucination-free, comprehensive, reliable, and efficient RAG}. We define four key metrics to assess generation quality and develop an automated benchmarking pipeline to evaluate the outputs of multiple LLMs across a variety of RAG scenarios. Using \textbf{RAG-Reward}, we train reward models and apply {reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF)} to improve LLMs' effectiveness in RAG. Experimental results demonstrate that our reward model achieves state-of-the-art performance in automatic benchmarking and aligns closely with human evaluations. Furthermore, the improved generation quality of the trained policy model highlights the feasibility and efficiency of using RLHF to enhance RAG outputs.</p></details> | Preprint |

In this paper, we introduce an omnidirectional and automatic RAG benchmark, OmniEval, in the financial domain. Our benchmark is characterized by its multi-dimensional evaluation framework, including (1) a matrix-based RAG scenario evaluation system that categorizes queries into five task classes and 16 financial topics, leading to a structured assessment of diverse query scenarios; (2) a multi-dimensional evaluation data generation approach, which combines GPT-4-based automatic generation and human annotation, achieving an 87.47\% acceptance ratio in human evaluations on generated instances; (3) a multi-stage evaluation system that evaluates both retrieval and generation performance, result in a comprehensive evaluation on the RAG pipeline; and (4) robust evaluation metrics derived from rule-based and LLM-based ones, enhancing the reliability of assessments through manual annotations and supervised fine-tuning of an LLM evaluator. Our experiments demonstrate the comprehensiveness of OmniEval, which includes extensive test datasets and highlights the performance variations of RAG systems across diverse topics and tasks, revealing significant opportunities for RAG models to improve their capabilities in vertical domains. We open source the code of our benchmark in \href{https://github.com/RUC-NLPIR/OmniEval}{https://github.com/RUC-NLPIR/OmniEval}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Does RAG Really Perform Bad For Long-Context Processing?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11444v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The efficient processing of long context poses a serious challenge for large language models (LLMs). Recently, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising strategy for this problem, as it enables LLMs to make selective use of the long context for efficient computation. However, existing RAG approaches lag behind other long-context processing methods due to inherent limitations on inaccurate retrieval and fragmented contexts. To address these challenges, we introduce RetroLM, a novel RAG framework for long-context processing. Unlike traditional methods, RetroLM employs KV-level retrieval augmentation, where it partitions the LLM's KV cache into contiguous pages and retrieves the most crucial ones for efficient computation. This approach enhances robustness to retrieval inaccuracy, facilitates effective utilization of fragmented contexts, and saves the cost from repeated computation. Building on this framework, we further develop a specialized retriever for precise retrieval of critical pages and conduct unsupervised post-training to optimize the model's ability to leverage retrieved information. We conduct comprehensive evaluations with a variety of benchmarks, including LongBench, InfiniteBench, and RULER, where RetroLM significantly outperforms existing long-context LLMs and efficient long-context processing methods, particularly in tasks requiring intensive reasoning or extremely long-context comprehension.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Robust RAG: Do We Still Need Complex Robust Training in the Era of Powerful LLMs?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11400v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems often suffer from performance degradation when encountering noisy or irrelevant documents, driving researchers to develop sophisticated training strategies to enhance their robustness against such retrieval noise. However, as large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the necessity of these complex training methods is increasingly questioned. In this paper, we systematically investigate whether complex robust training strategies remain necessary as model capacity grows. Through comprehensive experiments spanning multiple model architectures and parameter scales, we evaluate various document selection methods and adversarial training techniques across diverse datasets. Our extensive experiments consistently demonstrate that as models become more powerful, the performance gains brought by complex robust training methods drop off dramatically. We delve into the rationale and find that more powerful models inherently exhibit superior confidence calibration, better generalization across datasets (even when trained with randomly selected documents), and optimal attention mechanisms learned with simpler strategies. Our findings suggest that RAG systems can benefit from simpler architectures and training strategies as models become more powerful, enabling more scalable applications with minimal complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[FunnelRAG: A Coarse-to-Fine Progressive Retrieval Paradigm for RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10293v3)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) prevails in Large Language Models. It mainly consists of retrieval and generation. The retrieval modules (a.k.a. retrievers) aim to find useful information used to facilitate the generation modules (a.k.a. generators). As such, generators' performance largely depends on the effectiveness and efficiency of retrievers. However, the widely used retrieval paradigm remains flat. It treats retrieval procedures as a one-off deal with constant granularity. Despite effectiveness, we argue that they suffer from two limitations: (1) flat retrieval exerts a significant burden on one retriever; (2) constant granularity limits the ceiling of retrieval performance. In this work, we propose a progressive retrieval paradigm with coarse-to-fine granularity for RAG, termed FunnelRAG, so as to balance effectiveness and efficiency. Specifically, FunnelRAG establishes a progressive retrieval pipeline by collaborating coarse-to-fine granularity, large-to-small quantity, and low-to-high capacity, which can relieve the burden on one retriever and also promote the ceiling of retrieval performance. Extensive experiments manifest that FunnelRAG achieves comparable retrieval performance while the time overhead is reduced by nearly 40 percent.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures, 13 tables.

| **[RAG vs. GraphRAG: A Systematic Evaluation and Key Insights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11371v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the performance of LLMs across various tasks by retrieving relevant information from external sources, particularly on text-based data. For structured data, such as knowledge graphs, GraphRAG has been widely used to retrieve relevant information. However, recent studies have revealed that structuring implicit knowledge from text into graphs can benefit certain tasks, extending the application of GraphRAG from graph data to general text-based data. Despite their successful extensions, most applications of GraphRAG for text data have been designed for specific tasks and datasets, lacking a systematic evaluation and comparison between RAG and GraphRAG on widely used text-based benchmarks. In this paper, we systematically evaluate RAG and GraphRAG on well-established benchmark tasks, such as Question Answering and Query-based Summarization. Our results highlight the distinct strengths of RAG and GraphRAG across different tasks and evaluation perspectives. Inspired by these observations, we investigate strategies to integrate their strengths to improve downstream tasks. Additionally, we provide an in-depth discussion of the shortcomings of current GraphRAG approaches and outline directions for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating Language Preference of Multilingual RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11175v1)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) systems enhance language models by integrating external multilingual information to produce context-aware responses. However, mRAG systems struggle with retrieving relevant information due to linguistic variations between queries and documents, generating inconsistent responses when multilingual sources conflict. In this work, we systematically investigate language preferences in both retrieval and generation of mRAG through a series of experiments. Our analysis indicates that retrievers tend to prefer high-resource and query languages, yet this preference does not consistently improve generation performance. Moreover, we observe that generators prefer the query language or Latin scripts, leading to inconsistent outputs. To overcome these issues, we propose Dual Knowledge Multilingual RAG (DKM-RAG), a simple yet effective framework that fuses translated multilingual passages with complementary model knowledge. Empirical results demonstrate that DKM-RAG mitigates language preference in generation and enhances performance across diverse linguistic settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 16 tables, 14 figures</p></details> |

These two capabilities are complementary to each other and essential for LLMs to process large volumes of information that cannot fit into a single prompt. We present a detailed continued training recipe to extend the context window of Llama3-70B-base from 8K to 128K tokens, along with a three-stage instruction tuning process to enhance the model's instruction-following, RAG performance, and long-context understanding capabilities. Our results demonstrate that the Llama3-ChatQA-2-70B model outperforms most existing state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4-Turbo-2024-04-09, Qwen2-72B-Instruct, and Llama3.1-70B-Instruct, on ultra-long tasks beyond 100K tokens, as well as on the RAG benchmark using only a 4K context window, showing the strong long context capability across varying sequence lengths. We further provide extensive comparisons between direct long-context and RAG solutions using the same state-of-the-art long-context LLMs. Interestingly, we find that the performance of strong long-context LLMs using RAG improves when retrieving a larger number of chunks. With a large set of top-k chunks, RAG consistently outperforms direct long-context solution using the same state-of-the-art long-context models (e.g., Llama3-ChatQA-2-70B and Qwen2-72B-Instruct) on both 32K and 128K benchmarks.

| **[Hallucinations and Truth: A Comprehensive Accuracy Evaluation of RAG, LoRA and DoRA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10497v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Generative AI have significantly improved the efficiency and adaptability of natural language processing (NLP) systems, particularly through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA). RAG integrates external knowledge to enhance factual consistency in generative outputs, while LoRA enables parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). DoRA further refines this process by optimizing fine-tuning through adaptive parameter ranking and domain-aware weight adjustments, improving learning efficiency while maintaining inference performance. This paper presents a large-scale empirical evaluation of RAG, LoRA, and DoRA, with model fine-tuning and generation performance assessed on 20,000 FAQ-based queries, while the knowledge base spans 400,000 entries. The study analyzes key performance metrics such as accuracy, relevance, and inference latency. Experimental results demonstrate that DoRA achieves the highest accuracy (90.1%), relevance score (0.88), and lowest latency (110 ms per query), outperforming both LoRA and RAG in real-world, domain-specific generative AI applications. Furthermore, this study examines the trade-offs between fine-tuning efficiency, computational cost, and real-time adaptability across different models. Findings highlight RAG's effectiveness in knowledge grounding, LoRA's cost-efficient domain adaptation, and DoRA's ability to balance fine-tuning efficiency with model precision. These insights provide practical guidance for deploying AI-driven generative systems in accuracy-critical domains such as healthcare, finance, and legal services, ensuring scalability, reliability, and optimal performance in dynamic environments.</p></details> | 10 Pages |
| **[EACO-RAG: Towards Distributed Tiered LLM Deployment using Edge-Assisted and Collaborative RAG with Adaptive Knowledge Update](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20299v2)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in language tasks, but they require high computing power and rely on static knowledge. To overcome these limitations, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) incorporates up-to-date external information into LLMs without extensive fine-tuning. Meanwhile, small language models (SLMs) deployed on edge devices offer efficiency and low latency but often struggle with complex reasoning tasks. Unfortunately, current RAG approaches are predominantly based on centralized databases and have not been adapted to address the distinct constraints associated with deploying SLMs in edge environments. To bridge this gap, we propose Edge-Assisted and Collaborative RAG (EACO-RAG), a lightweight framework that leverages distributed edge nodes for adaptive knowledge updates and retrieval. EACO-RAG also employs a hierarchical collaborative gating mechanism to dynamically select among local, edge-assisted, and cloud-based strategies, with a carefully designed algorithm based on Safe Online Bayesian Optimization to maximize the potential performance enhancements. Experimental results demonstrate that EACO-RAG matches the accuracy of cloud-based knowledge graph RAG systems while reducing total costs by up to 84.6% under relaxed delay constraints and by 65.3% under stricter delay requirements. This work represents our initial effort toward achieving a distributed and scalable tiered LLM deployments, with EACO-RAG serving as a promising first step in unlocking the full potential of hybrid edge-cloud intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[KET-RAG: A Cost-Efficient Multi-Granular Indexing Framework for Graph-RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09304v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-RAG constructs a knowledge graph from text chunks to improve retrieval in Large Language Model (LLM)-based question answering. It is particularly useful in domains such as biomedicine, law, and political science, where retrieval often requires multi-hop reasoning over proprietary documents. Some existing Graph-RAG systems construct KNN graphs based on text chunk relevance, but this coarse-grained approach fails to capture entity relationships within texts, leading to sub-par retrieval and generation quality. To address this, recent solutions leverage LLMs to extract entities and relationships from text chunks, constructing triplet-based knowledge graphs. However, this approach incurs significant indexing costs, especially for large document collections. To ensure a good result accuracy while reducing the indexing cost, we propose KET-RAG, a multi-granular indexing framework. KET-RAG first identifies a small set of key text chunks and leverages an LLM to construct a knowledge graph skeleton. It then builds a text-keyword bipartite graph from all text chunks, serving as a lightweight alternative to a full knowledge graph. During retrieval, KET-RAG searches both structures: it follows the local search strategy of existing Graph-RAG systems on the skeleton while mimicking this search on the bipartite graph to improve retrieval quality. We evaluate eight solutions on two real-world datasets, demonstrating that KET-RAG outperforms all competitors in indexing cost, retrieval effectiveness, and generation quality. Notably, it achieves comparable or superior retrieval quality to Microsoft's Graph-RAG while reducing indexing costs by over an order of magnitude. Additionally, it improves the generation quality by up to 32.4% while lowering indexing costs by around 20%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing RAG with Active Learning on Conversation Records: Reject Incapables and Answer Capables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09073v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a key technique for leveraging external knowledge and reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However, RAG still struggles to fully prevent hallucinated responses. To address this, it is essential to identify samples prone to hallucination or guide LLMs toward correct responses, which experts then annotate to develop high-quality datasets for refining LLMs. However, the growing scarcity of such datasets makes their creation challenging. This paper proposes using the vast amount of conversations from widespread LLM usage to build these datasets, training LLMs to avoid hallucination-prone questions while accurately responding to manageable ones. Given the impracticality of expert-annotating all conversation records, the paper introduces AL4RAG, which uses active learning to select the most suitable conversation samples for annotation, optimizing performance within an annotation budget. Additionally, recognizing that traditional active learning methods are not fully compatible with RAG due to unsuitable distance metrics, we develop a novel sample distance measurement for RAG active learning. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms baselines across multiple metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diversity Enhances an LLM's Performance in RAG and Long-context Task](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09017v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the challenge of context window limitations, primarily due to the quadratic time complexity of the self-attention mechanism (\(O(N^2)\), where \(N\) denotes the context window length). This constraint impacts tasks such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in question answering (Q\&A) and long context summarization. A common approach involves selecting content with the highest similarity to the query; however, this often leads to redundancy and the exclusion of diverse yet relevant information. Building on principles from Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) and Farthest Point Sampling (FPS), we integrate diversity into the content selection process. Our findings reveal that incorporating diversity substantially increases the recall of selecting relevant sentences or chunks before LLM-based Q\&A and summarization. These results highlight the importance of maintaining diversity in future LLM applications to further improve summarization and Q\&A outcomes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Better RAG using Relevant Information Gain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12101v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A common way to extend the memory of large language models (LLMs) is by retrieval augmented generation (RAG), which inserts text retrieved from a larger memory into an LLM's context window. However, the context window is typically limited to several thousand tokens, which limits the number of retrieved passages that can inform a model's response. For this reason, it's important to avoid occupying context window space with redundant information by ensuring a degree of diversity among retrieved passages. At the same time, the information should also be relevant to the current task. Most prior methods that encourage diversity among retrieved results, such as Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR), do so by incorporating an objective that explicitly trades off diversity and relevance. We propose a novel simple optimization metric based on relevant information gain, a probabilistic measure of the total information relevant to a query for a set of retrieved results. By optimizing this metric, diversity organically emerges from our system. When used as a drop-in replacement for the retrieval component of a RAG system, this method yields state-of-the-art performance on question answering tasks from the Retrieval Augmented Generation Benchmark (RGB), outperforming existing metrics that directly optimize for relevance and diversity.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 page paper submitted to EMNLP</p></details> |

However, current implementations face two critical challenges: maintaining factual accuracy and delivering coherent, context-aware instruction. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) partially addresses these issues, its reliance on pure semantic similarity limits its effectiveness in educational contexts where conceptual relationships are crucial. This paper introduces Knowledge Graph-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG), a novel framework that integrates structured knowledge representation with context-aware retrieval to enable more effective AI tutoring. We present three key contributions: (1) a novel architecture that grounds AI responses in structured domain knowledge, (2) empirical validation through controlled experiments (n=76) demonstrating significant learning improvements (35% increase in assessment scores, p<0.001), and (3) a comprehensive implementation framework addressing practical deployment considerations.

| **[A RAG Approach for Generating Competency Questions in Ontology Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08820v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Competency question (CQ) formulation is central to several ontology development and evaluation methodologies. Traditionally, the task of crafting these competency questions heavily relies on the effort of domain experts and knowledge engineers which is often time-consuming and labor-intensive. With the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), there arises the possibility to automate and enhance this process. Unlike other similar works which use existing ontologies or knowledge graphs as input to LLMs, we present a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach that uses LLMs for the automatic generation of CQs given a set of scientific papers considered to be a domain knowledge base. We investigate its performance and specifically, we study the impact of different number of papers to the RAG and different temperature setting of the LLM. We conduct experiments using GPT-4 on two domain ontology engineering tasks and compare results against ground-truth CQs constructed by domain experts. Empirical assessments on the results, utilizing evaluation metrics (precision and consistency), reveal that compared to zero-shot prompting, adding relevant domain knowledge to the RAG improves the performance of LLMs on generating CQs for concrete ontology engineering tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional RAG-based tool retrieval fails to capture structured dependencies between tools, limiting the retrieval accuracy of a retrieved tool's dependencies. For example, among a vector database of tools, a "get stock price" API requires a "stock ticker" parameter from a "get stock ticker" API, and both depend on OS-level internet connectivity tools. In this paper, we address this limitation by introducing Graph RAG-Tool Fusion, a novel plug-and-play approach that combines the strengths of vector-based retrieval with efficient graph traversal to capture all relevant tools (nodes) along with any nested dependencies (edges) within the predefined tool knowledge graph. We also present ToolLinkOS, a new tool selection benchmark of 573 fictional tools, spanning over 15 industries, each with an average of 6.3 tool dependencies. We demonstrate that Graph RAG-Tool Fusion achieves absolute improvements of 71.7% and 22.1% over na\"ive RAG on ToolLinkOS and ToolSandbox benchmarks, respectively (mAP@10).

While language models show promise in this context, their probabilistic nature complicates truthfulness and comprehensibility. This paper examines state-of-the-art Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhanced with alignment techniques to fulfill GDPR obligations. We evaluate RAG systems incorporating an alignment module like Rewindable Auto-regressive Inference (RAIN) and our proposed multidimensional extension, MultiRAIN, using a Privacy Q&A dataset. Responses are optimized for preciseness and comprehensibility and are assessed through 21 metrics, including deterministic and large language model-based evaluations. Our results show that RAG systems with an alignment module outperform baseline RAG systems on most metrics, though none fully match human answers. Principal component analysis of the results reveals complex interactions between metrics, highlighting the need to refine metrics. This study provides a foundation for integrating advanced natural language processing systems into legal compliance frameworks.</p></details> | Submitted to ARR |

Currently, the most popular methods in literature consists of fine-tuning the model on written mathematical content such as academic publications and textbooks, so that the model can learn to emulate the style of mathematical writing. In this project, we explore the effectiveness of using retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to address gaps in the mathematical reasoning of LLMs. We develop LemmaHead, a RAG knowledge base that supplements queries to the model with relevant mathematical context, with particular focus on context from published textbooks. To measure our model's performance in mathematical reasoning, our testing paradigm focuses on the task of automated theorem proving via generating proofs to a given mathematical claim in the Lean formal language.</p></details> |  |

Through systematic empirical evaluation of three different LLM variants across multiple parameter configurations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our testing methodology in assessing both functional correctness and extra-functional properties. Our framework implements 17 distinct metrics that encompass syntactic analysis, semantic evaluation, and behavioral evaluation through LLM judges. The study reveals significant information about how different architectural choices and parameter configurations affect system performance, particularly highlighting the impact of temperature and top-p parameters on response quality. The tests were carried out on a tourism recommendation system for the V\"armland region, utilizing standard and RAG-enhanced configurations. The results indicate that the newer LLM versions show modest improvements in performance metrics, though the differences are more pronounced in response length and complexity rather than in semantic quality. The research contributes practical insights for implementing robust testing practices in LLM-RAG systems, providing valuable guidance to organizations deploying these architectures in production environments.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Typically, such RAG systems retrieve search results, download HTML sources of the results, and then extract plain texts from the HTML sources. Plain text documents or chunks are fed into the LLMs to augment the generation. However, much of the structural and semantic information inherent in HTML, such as headings and table structures, is lost during this plain-text-based RAG process. To alleviate this problem, we propose HtmlRAG, which uses HTML instead of plain text as the format of retrieved knowledge in RAG. We believe HTML is better than plain text in modeling knowledge in external documents, and most LLMs possess robust capacities to understand HTML. However, utilizing HTML presents new challenges. HTML contains additional content such as tags, JavaScript, and CSS specifications, which bring extra input tokens and noise to the RAG system. To address this issue, we propose HTML cleaning, compression, and a two-step block-tree-based pruning strategy, to shorten the HTML while minimizing the loss of information. Experiments on six QA datasets confirm the superiority of using HTML in RAG systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WWW 2025 main conference.

To this aim, this paper introduces a solution driven by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which leverages the capabilities of generative Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the retrieval of health-related documents grounded in scientific evidence. In particular, we propose a three-stage model: in the first stage, the user's query is employed to retrieve topically relevant passages with associated references from a knowledge base constituted by scientific literature. In the second stage, these passages, alongside the initial query, are processed by LLMs to generate a contextually relevant rich text (GenText). In the last stage, the documents to be retrieved are evaluated and ranked both from the point of view of topical relevance and factual accuracy by means of their comparison with GenText, either through stance detection or semantic similarity. In addition to calculating factual accuracy, GenText can offer a layer of explainability for it, aiding users in understanding the reasoning behind the retrieval. Experimental evaluation of our model on benchmark datasets and against baseline models demonstrates its effectiveness in enhancing the retrieval of both topically relevant and factually accurate health information, thus presenting a significant step forward in the health misinformation mitigation problem.</p></details> |  |

While existing approaches such as ReAct maintain reasoning chains within the language model's context window, we observe that this often leads to plan fragmentation and execution failures. Our key insight is that by isolating the reasoning plan as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) outside the LM's working memory, we can enable (1) systematic exploration of reasoning paths, (2) atomic subqueries enabling precise retrievals and grounding, and (3) efficiency through parallel execution and bounded context window utilization. Moreover, Plan*RAG's modular design allows it to be integrated with existing RAG methods, thus providing a practical solution to improve current RAG systems. On standard multi-hop reasoning benchmarks, Plan*RAG consistently achieves improvements over recently proposed methods such as RQ-RAG and Self-RAG, while maintaining comparable computational costs.</p></details> | 19 pages, preprint |

However, their reliance on static training data limits their ability to respond to dynamic, real time queries, resulting in outdated or inaccurate outputs. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a solution, enhancing LLMs by integrating real time data retrieval to provide contextually relevant and up-to-date responses. Despite its promise, traditional RAG systems are constrained by static workflows and lack the adaptability required for multistep reasoning and complex task management. Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG) transcends these limitations by embedding autonomous AI agents into the RAG pipeline. These agents leverage agentic design patterns reflection, planning, tool use, and multiagent collaboration to dynamically manage retrieval strategies, iteratively refine contextual understanding, and adapt workflows to meet complex task requirements. This integration enables Agentic RAG systems to deliver unparalleled flexibility, scalability, and context awareness across diverse applications. This survey provides a comprehensive exploration of Agentic RAG, beginning with its foundational principles and the evolution of RAG paradigms. It presents a detailed taxonomy of Agentic RAG architectures, highlights key applications in industries such as healthcare, finance, and education, and examines practical implementation strategies. Additionally, it addresses challenges in scaling these systems, ensuring ethical decision making, and optimizing performance for real-world applications, while providing detailed insights into frameworks and tools for implementing Agentic RAG.</p></details> |  |

Mitigation is achieved in a question-answering Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework while detection is obtained by introducing the Negative Missing Information Scoring System (NMISS), which accounts for contextual relevance in responses. While RAG mitigates hallucinations by grounding answers in external data, NMISS refines the evaluation by identifying cases where traditional metrics incorrectly flag contextually accurate responses as hallucinations. I use Italian health news articles as context to evaluate LLM performance. Results show that Gemma2 and GPT-4 outperform the other models, with GPT-4 producing answers closely aligned with reference responses. Mid-tier models, such as Llama2, Llama3, and Mistral benefit significantly from NMISS, highlighting their ability to provide richer contextual information. This combined approach offers new insights into the reduction and more accurate assessment of hallucinations in LLMs, with applications in real-world healthcare tasks and other domains.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches predominantly rely on prompt engineering, utilizing meticulously designed expert response chains or structured guidance. However, prompt-based techniques have failed to perform well in the sensor array signal processing (SASP) area due the lack of specific domain knowledge. To address this issue, we propose an automated modeling approach based on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique, which consists of two principal components: a multi-agent (MA) structure and a graph-based RAG (Graph-RAG) process. The MA structure is tailored for the architectural AOM process, with each agent being designed based on principles of human modeling procedure. The Graph-RAG process serves to match user query with specific SASP modeling knowledge, thereby enhancing the modeling result. Results on ten classical signal processing problems demonstrate that the proposed approach (termed as MAG-RAG) outperforms several AOM benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[URAG: Implementing a Unified Hybrid RAG for Precise Answers in University Admission Chatbots -- A Case Study at HCMUT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16276v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence, particularly in Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become pivotal in educational question-answering systems, especially university admission chatbots. Concepts such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and other advanced techniques have been developed to enhance these systems by integrating specific university data, enabling LLMs to provide informed responses on admissions and academic counseling. However, these enhanced RAG techniques often involve high operational costs and require the training of complex, specialized modules, which poses challenges for practical deployment. Additionally, in the educational context, it is crucial to provide accurate answers to prevent misinformation, a task that LLM-based systems find challenging without appropriate strategies and methods. In this paper, we introduce the Unified RAG (URAG) Framework, a hybrid approach that significantly improves the accuracy of responses, particularly for critical queries. Experimental results demonstrate that URAG enhances our in-house, lightweight model to perform comparably to state-of-the-art commercial models. Moreover, to validate its practical applicability, we conducted a case study at our educational institution, which received positive feedback and acclaim. This study not only proves the effectiveness of URAG but also highlights its feasibility for real-world implementation in educational settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at SoICT'24</p></details> |

However, current benchmarks for evaluating RAG systems suffer from two key deficiencies: (1) they fail to adequately measure LLMs' capability in handling long-context retrieval due to a lack of datasets that reflect the characteristics of retrieved documents, and (2) they lack a comprehensive evaluation method for assessing LLMs' ability to generate long-form responses that effectively exploits retrieved information. To address these shortcomings, we introduce the Long$^2$RAG benchmark and the Key Point Recall (KPR) metric. Long$^2$RAG comprises 280 questions spanning 10 domains and across 8 question categories, each associated with 5 retrieved documents with an average length of 2,444 words. KPR evaluates the extent to which LLMs incorporate key points extracted from the retrieved documents into their generated responses, providing a more nuanced assessment of their ability to exploit retrieved information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP'24 (Findings).

| **[Advanced Real-Time Fraud Detection Using RAG-Based LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15290v1)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial Intelligence has become a double edged sword in modern society being both a boon and a bane. While it empowers individuals it also enables malicious actors to perpetrate scams such as fraudulent phone calls and user impersonations. This growing threat necessitates a robust system to protect individuals In this paper we introduce a novel real time fraud detection mechanism using Retrieval Augmented Generation technology to address this challenge on two fronts. First our system incorporates a continuously updating policy checking feature that transcribes phone calls in real time and uses RAG based models to verify that the caller is not soliciting private information thus ensuring transparency and the authenticity of the conversation. Second we implement a real time user impersonation check with a two step verification process to confirm the callers identity ensuring accountability. A key innovation of our system is the ability to update policies without retraining the entire model enhancing its adaptability. We validated our RAG based approach using synthetic call recordings achieving an accuracy of 97.98 percent and an F1score of 97.44 percent with 100 calls outperforming state of the art methods. This robust and flexible fraud detection system is well suited for real world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[A RAG-Based Institutional Assistant](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13880v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong text generation capabilities, they struggle in scenarios requiring access to structured knowledge bases or specific documents, limiting their effectiveness in knowledge-intensive tasks. To address this limitation, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models have been developed, enabling generative models to incorporate relevant document fragments into their inputs. In this paper, we design and evaluate a RAG-based virtual assistant specifically tailored for the University of S\~ao Paulo. Our system architecture comprises two key modules: a retriever and a generative model. We experiment with different types of models for both components, adjusting hyperparameters such as chunk size and the number of retrieved documents. Our optimal retriever model achieves a Top-5 accuracy of 30%, while our most effective generative model scores 22.04\% against ground truth answers. Notably, when the correct document chunks are supplied to the LLMs, accuracy significantly improves to 54.02%, an increase of over 30 percentage points. Conversely, without contextual input, performance declines to 13.68%. These findings highlight the critical role of database access in enhancing LLM performance. They also reveal the limitations of current semantic search methods in accurately identifying relevant documents and underscore the ongoing challenges LLMs face in generating precise responses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parallel Key-Value Cache Fusion for Position Invariant RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07523v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) underscore the necessity of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to leverage external information. However, LLMs are sensitive to the position of relevant information within contexts and tend to generate incorrect responses when such information is placed in the middle, known as `Lost in the Middle' phenomenon. In this paper, we introduce a framework that generates consistent outputs for decoder-only models, irrespective of the input context order. Experimental results for three open domain question answering tasks demonstrate position invariance, where the model is not sensitive to input context order, and superior robustness to irrelevent passages compared to prevailing approaches for RAG pipelines.</p></details> | 5 pages |
| **[Towards Interpretable Radiology Report Generation via Concept Bottlenecks using a Multi-Agentic RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16086v2)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has advanced medical image classification, but interpretability challenges hinder its clinical adoption. This study enhances interpretability in Chest X-ray (CXR) classification by using concept bottleneck models (CBMs) and a multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for report generation. By modeling relationships between visual features and clinical concepts, we create interpretable concept vectors that guide a multi-agent RAG system to generate radiology reports, enhancing clinical relevance, explainability, and transparency. Evaluation of the generated reports using an LLM-as-a-judge confirmed the interpretability and clinical utility of our model's outputs. On the COVID-QU dataset, our model achieved 81% classification accuracy and demonstrated robust report generation performance, with five key metrics ranging between 84% and 90%. This interpretable multi-agent framework bridges the gap between high-performance AI and the explainability required for reliable AI-driven CXR analysis in clinical settings.

| **[RAG with Differential Privacy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19291v2)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the dominant technique to provide \emph{Large Language Models} (LLM) with fresh and relevant context, mitigating the risk of hallucinations and improving the overall quality of responses in environments with large and fast moving knowledge bases. However, the integration of external documents into the generation process raises significant privacy concerns. Indeed, when added to a prompt, it is not possible to guarantee a response will not inadvertently expose confidential data, leading to potential breaches of privacy and ethical dilemmas. This paper explores a practical solution to this problem suitable to general knowledge extraction from personal data. It shows \emph{differentially private token generation} is a viable approach to private RAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating Diverse Q&A Benchmarks for RAG Evaluation with DataMorgana](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12789v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, especially in domain-specific contexts, requires benchmarks that address the distinctive requirements of the applicative scenario. Since real data can be hard to obtain, a common strategy is to use LLM-based methods to generate synthetic data. Existing solutions are general purpose: given a document, they generate a question to build a Q&A pair. However, although the generated questions can be individually good, they are typically not diverse enough to reasonably cover the different ways real end-users can interact with the RAG system. We introduce here DataMorgana, a tool for generating highly customizable and diverse synthetic Q&A benchmarks tailored to RAG applications. DataMorgana enables detailed configurations of user and question categories and provides control over their distribution within the benchmark. It uses a lightweight two-stage process, ensuring efficiency and fast iterations, while generating benchmarks that reflect the expected traffic. We conduct a thorough line of experiments, showing quantitatively and qualitatively that DataMorgana surpasses existing tools and approaches in producing lexically, syntactically, and semantically diverse question sets across domain-specific and general-knowledge corpora. DataMorgana will be made available to selected teams in the research community, as first beta testers, in the context of the upcoming SIGIR'2025 LiveRAG challenge to be announced in early February 2025.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual RAG: Expanding MLLM visual knowledge without fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10834v1)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved notable performance in computer vision tasks that require reasoning across visual and textual modalities, yet their capabilities are limited to their pre-trained data, requiring extensive fine-tuning for updates. Recent researches have explored the use of In-Context Learning (ICL) to overcome these challenges by providing a set of demonstrating examples as context to augment MLLMs performance in several tasks, showing that many-shot ICL leads to substantial improvements compared to few-shot ICL. However, the reliance on numerous demonstrating examples and the limited MLLMs context windows presents significant obstacles. This paper aims to address these challenges by introducing a novel approach, Visual RAG, that synergically combines the MLLMs capability to learn from the context, with a retrieval mechanism. The crux of this approach is to ensure to augment the MLLM knowledge by selecting only the most relevant demonstrating examples for the query, pushing it to learn by analogy. In this way, relying on the new information provided dynamically during inference time, the resulting system is not limited to the knowledge extracted from the training data, but can be updated rapidly and easily without fine-tuning. Furthermore, this greatly reduces the computational costs for improving the model image classification performance, and augments the model knowledge to new visual domains and tasks it was not trained for. Extensive experiments on eight different datasets in the state of the art spanning several domains and image classification tasks show that the proposed Visual RAG, compared to the most recent state of the art (i.e., many-shot ICL), is able to obtain an accuracy that is very close or even higher (approx. +2% improvement on average) while using a much smaller set of demonstrating examples (approx. only 23% on average).</p></details> |  |
| **[4bit-Quantization in Vector-Embedding for RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10534v1)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a promising technique that has shown great potential in addressing some of the limitations of large language models (LLMs). LLMs have two major limitations: they can contain outdated information due to their training data, and they can generate factually inaccurate responses, a phenomenon known as hallucinations. RAG aims to mitigate these issues by leveraging a database of relevant documents, which are stored as embedding vectors in a high-dimensional space. However, one of the challenges of using high-dimensional embeddings is that they require a significant amount of memory to store. This can be a major issue, especially when dealing with large databases of documents. To alleviate this problem, we propose the use of 4-bit quantization to store the embedding vectors. This involves reducing the precision of the vectors from 32-bit floating-point numbers to 4-bit integers, which can significantly reduce the memory requirements. Our approach has several benefits. Firstly, it significantly reduces the memory storage requirements of the high-dimensional vector database, making it more feasible to deploy RAG systems in resource-constrained environments. Secondly, it speeds up the searching process, as the reduced precision of the vectors allows for faster computation. Our code is available at https://github.com/taeheej/4bit-Quantization-in-Vector-Embedding-for-RAG</p></details> |  |
| **[SteLLA: A Structured Grading System Using LLMs with RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09092v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong general capabilities in many applications. However, how to make them reliable tools for some specific tasks such as automated short answer grading (ASAG) remains a challenge. We present SteLLA (Structured Grading System Using LLMs with RAG) in which a) Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach is used to empower LLMs specifically on the ASAG task by extracting structured information from the highly relevant and reliable external knowledge based on the instructor-provided reference answer and rubric, b) an LLM performs a structured and question-answering-based evaluation of student answers to provide analytical grades and feedback. A real-world dataset that contains students' answers in an exam was collected from a college-level Biology course. Experiments show that our proposed system can achieve substantial agreement with the human grader while providing break-down grades and feedback on all the knowledge points examined in the problem. A qualitative and error analysis of the feedback generated by GPT4 shows that GPT4 is good at capturing facts while may be prone to inferring too much implication from the given text in the grading task which provides insights into the usage of LLMs in the ASAG system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Addressing the sustainable AI trilemma: a case study on LLM agents and RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08262v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities, but their widespread deployment and more advanced applications raise critical sustainability challenges, particularly in inference energy consumption. We propose the concept of the Sustainable AI Trilemma, highlighting the tensions between AI capability, digital equity, and environmental sustainability. Through a systematic case study of LLM agents and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), we analyze the energy costs embedded in memory module designs and introduce novel metrics to quantify the trade-offs between energy consumption and system performance. Our experimental results reveal significant energy inefficiencies in current memory-augmented frameworks and demonstrate that resource-constrained environments face disproportionate efficiency penalties. Our findings challenge the prevailing LLM-centric paradigm in agent design and provide practical insights for developing more sustainable AI systems.</p></details> |  |
