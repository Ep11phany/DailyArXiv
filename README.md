| **[ctELM: Decoding and Manipulating Embeddings of Clinical Trials with Embedding Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18796v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text embeddings have become an essential part of a variety of language applications. However, methods for interpreting, exploring and reversing embedding spaces are limited, reducing transparency and precluding potentially valuable generative use cases. In this work, we align Large Language Models to embeddings of clinical trials using the recently reported Embedding Language Model (ELM) method. We develop an open-source, domain-agnostic ELM architecture and training framework, design training tasks for clinical trials, and introduce an expert-validated synthetic dataset. We then train a series of ELMs exploring the impact of tasks and training regimes. Our final model, ctELM, can accurately describe and compare unseen clinical trials from embeddings alone and produce plausible clinical trials from novel vectors. We further show that generated trial abstracts are responsive to moving embeddings along concept vectors for age and sex of study subjects. Our public ELM implementation and experimental results will aid the alignment of Large Language Models to embedding spaces in the biomedical domain and beyond.</p></details> |  |
| **[MortalMATH: Evaluating the Conflict Between Reasoning Objectives and Emergency Contexts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18790v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models are increasingly optimized for deep reasoning, prioritizing the correct execution of complex tasks over general conversation. We investigate whether this focus on calculation creates a "tunnel vision" that ignores safety in critical situations. We introduce MortalMATH, a benchmark of 150 scenarios where users request algebra help while describing increasingly life-threatening emergencies (e.g., stroke symptoms, freefall). We find a sharp behavioral split: generalist models (like Llama-3.1) successfully refuse the math to address the danger. In contrast, specialized reasoning models (like Qwen-3-32b and GPT-5-nano) often ignore the emergency entirely, maintaining over 95 percent task completion rates while the user describes dying. Furthermore, the computational time required for reasoning introduces dangerous delays: up to 15 seconds before any potential help is offered. These results suggest that training models to relentlessly pursue correct answers may inadvertently unlearn the survival instincts required for safe deployment.</p></details> |  |

We consider this paradigm through the example of Dramamancer, a system that uses an LLM to transform author-created story schemas into player-driven playthroughs. This extended abstract outlines some design techniques and evaluation considerations associated with this system.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended abstract presented at the 2025 Wordplay Workshop at EMNLP</p></details> |
| **[POPE: Learning to Reason on Hard Problems via Privileged On-Policy Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18779v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has improved the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), yet state-of-the-art methods still fail to learn on many training problems. On hard problems, on-policy RL rarely explores even a single correct rollout, yielding zero reward and no learning signal for driving improvement. We find that natural solutions to remedy this exploration problem from classical RL, such as entropy bonuses, more permissive clipping of the importance ratio, or direct optimization of pass@k objectives, do not resolve this issue and often destabilize optimization without improving solvability. A natural alternative is to leverage transfer from easier problems. However, we show that mixing easy and hard problems during RL training is counterproductive due to ray interference, where optimization focuses on already-solvable problems in a way that actively inhibits progress on harder ones. To address this challenge, we introduce Privileged On-Policy Exploration (POPE), an approach that leverages human- or other oracle solutions as privileged information to guide exploration on hard problems, unlike methods that use oracle solutions as training targets (e.g., off-policy RL methods or warmstarting from SFT). POPE augments hard problems with prefixes of oracle solutions, enabling RL to obtain non-zero rewards during guided rollouts. Crucially, the resulting behaviors transfer back to the original, unguided problems through a synergy between instruction-following and reasoning. Empirically, POPE expands the set of solvable problems and substantially improves performance on challenging reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[PRECISE: Reducing the Bias of LLM Evaluations Using Prediction-Powered Ranking Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18777v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating the quality of search, ranking and RAG systems traditionally requires a significant number of human relevance annotations. In recent times, several deployed systems have explored the usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated judges for this task while their inherent biases prevent direct use for metric estimation. We present a statistical framework extending Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI) that combines minimal human annotations with LLM judgments to produce reliable estimates of metrics which require sub-instance annotations. Our method requires as few as 100 human-annotated queries and 10,000 unlabeled examples, reducing annotation requirements significantly compared to traditional approaches. We formulate our proposed framework (PRECISE) for inference of relevance uplift for an LLM-based query reformulation application, extending PPI to sub-instance annotations at the query-document level. By reformulating the metric-integration space, we reduced the computational complexity from O(2^|C|) to O(2^K), where |C| represents corpus size (in order of millions). Detailed experiments across prominent retrieval datasets demonstrate that our method reduces the variance of estimates for the business-critical Precision@K metric, while effectively correcting for LLM bias in low-resource settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026 - Innovative Applications of AI (IAAI-26)</p></details> |
| **[Dep-Search: Learning Dependency-Aware Reasoning Traces with Persistent Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18771v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks, particularly when augmented with search mechanisms that enable systematic exploration of external knowledge bases. The field has evolved from traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks to more sophisticated search-based frameworks that orchestrate multi-step reasoning through explicit search strategies. However, existing search frameworks still rely heavily on implicit natural language reasoning to determine search strategies and how to leverage retrieved information across reasoning steps. This reliance on implicit reasoning creates fundamental challenges for managing dependencies between sub-questions, efficiently reusing previously retrieved knowledge, and learning optimal search strategies through reinforcement learning. To address these limitations, we propose Dep-Search, a dependency-aware search framework that advances beyond existing search frameworks by integrating structured reasoning, retrieval, and persistent memory through GRPO. Dep-Search introduces explicit control mechanisms that enable the model to decompose questions with dependency relationships, retrieve information when needed, access previously stored knowledge from memory, and summarize long reasoning contexts into reusable memory entries. Through extensive experiments on seven diverse question answering datasets, we demonstrate that Dep-Search significantly enhances LLMs' ability to tackle complex multi-hop reasoning tasks, achieving substantial improvements over strong baselines across different model scales.</p></details> | <details><summary>Dep-S...</summary><p>Dep-Search 1st version</p></details> |
| **[Goal-oriented Communication for Fast and Robust Robotic Fault Detection and Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18765v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous robotic systems are widely deployed in smart factories and operate in dynamic, uncertain, and human-involved environments that require low-latency and robust fault detection and recovery (FDR). However, existing FDR frameworks exhibit various limitations, such as significant delays in communication and computation, and unreliability in robot motion/trajectory generation, mainly because the communication-computation-control (3C) loop is designed without considering the downstream FDR goal. To address this, we propose a novel Goal-oriented Communication (GoC) framework that jointly designs the 3C loop tailored for fast and robust robotic FDR, with the goal of minimising the FDR time while maximising the robotic task (e.g., workpiece sorting) success rate. For fault detection, our GoC framework innovatively defines and extracts the 3D scene graph (3D-SG) as the semantic representation via our designed representation extractor, and detects faults by monitoring spatial relationship changes in the 3D-SG. For fault recovery, we fine-tune a small language model (SLM) via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and enhance its reasoning and generalization capabilities via knowledge distillation to generate recovery motions for robots. We also design a lightweight goal-oriented digital twin reconstruction module to refine the recovery motions generated by the SLM when fine-grained robotic control is required, using only task-relevant object contours for digital twin reconstruction. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our GoC framework reduces the FDR time by up to 82.6% and improves the task success rate by up to 76%, compared to the state-of-the-art frameworks that rely on vision language models for fault detection and large language models for fault recovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submit to IEEE for potential publication</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Preferences: Learning Alignment Principles Grounded in Human Reasons and Values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18760v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A crucial consideration when developing and deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) is the human values to which these models are aligned. In the constitutional framework of alignment models are aligned to a set of principles (the constitution) specified in natural language. However, it is unclear how to fairly determine this constitution with widespread stakeholder input. In this work we propose Grounded Constitutional AI (GCAI), a unified framework for generating constitutions of principles that are representative of both users' general expectations toward AI (general principles) and their interaction-time preferences (contextual principles). We extend the Inverse Constitutional AI (ICAI) approach to generate contextual principles from human preference annotation data by leveraging human-provided \textit{reasons} for their preferences. We supplement these contextual principles with general principles surfaced from user statements of \textit{values} regarding AI. We show that a constitution generated by GCAI is preferred by humans over one generated through ICAI both personally, and for widespread use in governing AI behavior. Additionally participants consider the GCAI constitution to be more morally grounded, coherent, and pluralistic.</p></details> |  |
| **[$α^3$-SecBench: A Large-Scale Evaluation Suite of Security, Resilience, and Trust for LLM-based UAV Agents over 6G Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18754v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems are increasingly deployed in safety-critical, networked environments where they must operate reliably in the presence of malicious adversaries. While recent benchmarks have evaluated large language model (LLM)-based UAV agents in reasoning, navigation, and efficiency, systematic assessment of security, resilience, and trust under adversarial conditions remains largely unexplored, particularly in emerging 6G-enabled settings. We introduce $α^{3}$-SecBench, the first large-scale evaluation suite for assessing the security-aware autonomy of LLM-based UAV agents under realistic adversarial interference. Building on multi-turn conversational UAV missions from $α^{3}$-Bench, the framework augments benign episodes with 20,000 validated security overlay attack scenarios targeting seven autonomy layers, including sensing, perception, planning, control, communication, edge/cloud infrastructure, and LLM reasoning. $α^{3}$-SecBench evaluates agents across three orthogonal dimensions: security (attack detection and vulnerability attribution), resilience (safe degradation behavior), and trust (policy-compliant tool usage). We evaluate 23 state-of-the-art LLMs from major industrial providers and leading AI labs using thousands of adversarially augmented UAV episodes sampled from a corpus of 113,475 missions spanning 175 threat types. While many models reliably detect anomalous behavior, effective mitigation, vulnerability attribution, and trustworthy control actions remain inconsistent. Normalized overall scores range from 12.9% to 57.1%, highlighting a significant gap between anomaly detection and security-aware autonomous decision-making. We release $α^{3}$-SecBench on GitHub: https://github.com/maferrag/AlphaSecBench</p></details> |  |
| **[HalluGuard: Demystifying Data-Driven and Reasoning-Driven Hallucinations in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18753v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, law, and scientific discovery is often compromised by hallucinations. These failures typically stem from two sources: data-driven hallucinations and reasoning-driven hallucinations. However, existing detection methods usually address only one source and rely on task-specific heuristics, limiting their generalization to complex scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Hallucination Risk Bound, a unified theoretical framework that formally decomposes hallucination risk into data-driven and reasoning-driven components, linked respectively to training-time mismatches and inference-time instabilities. This provides a principled foundation for analyzing how hallucinations emerge and evolve. Building on this foundation, we introduce HalluGuard, an NTK-based score that leverages the induced geometry and captured representations of the NTK to jointly identify data-driven and reasoning-driven hallucinations. We evaluate HalluGuard on 10 diverse benchmarks, 11 competitive baselines, and 9 popular LLM backbones, consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance in detecting diverse forms of LLM hallucinations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Have ...</summary><p>Have been accepted by ICLR'26</p></details> |
| **[Next Token Knowledge Tracing: Exploiting Pretrained LLM Representations to Decode Student Behaviour](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02599v2)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modelling student knowledge is a key challenge when leveraging AI in education, with major implications for personalised learning. The Knowledge Tracing (KT) task aims to predict how students will respond to educational questions in learning environments, based on their prior interactions. Existing KT models typically use response correctness along with metadata like skill tags and timestamps, often overlooking the question text, which is an important source of pedagogical insight. This omission poses a lost opportunity while limiting predictive performance. We propose Next Token Knowledge Tracing (NTKT), a novel approach that reframes KT as a next-token prediction task using pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs). NTKT represents both student histories and question content as sequences of text, allowing LLMs to learn patterns in both behaviour and language. Our series of experiments significantly improves performance over state-of-the-art neural KT models and generalises much better to cold-start questions and users. These findings highlight the importance of question content in KT and demonstrate the benefits of leveraging pretrained representations of LLMs to model student learning more effectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Distilled Reasoner: On-Policy Self-Distillation for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18734v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge distillation improves large language model (LLM) reasoning by compressing the knowledge of a teacher LLM to train smaller LLMs. On-policy distillation advances this approach by having the student sample its own trajectories while a teacher LLM provides dense token-level supervision, addressing the distribution mismatch between training and inference in off-policy distillation methods. However, on-policy distillation typically requires a separate, often larger, teacher LLM and does not explicitly leverage ground-truth solutions available in reasoning datasets. Inspired by the intuition that a sufficiently capable LLM can rationalize external privileged reasoning traces and teach its weaker self (i.e., the version without access to privileged information), we introduce On-Policy Self-Distillation (OPSD), a framework where a single model acts as both teacher and student by conditioning on different contexts. The teacher policy conditions on privileged information (e.g., verified reasoning traces) while the student policy sees only the question; training minimizes the per-token divergence between these distributions over the student's own rollouts. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, achieving 4-8x token efficiency compared to reinforcement learning methods such as GRPO and superior performance over off-policy distillation methods.</p></details> | 13 pages |

As the field transitions toward more complex task scenarios, multi-agent system frameworks are becoming essential for achieving scalable, efficient, and collaborative solutions. This shift is fueled by three primary factors: increasing agent capabilities, enhancing system efficiency through task delegation, and enabling advanced human-agent interactions. To address the challenges posed by multi-agent collaboration, we propose the Multi-Agent Robotic System (MARS) Challenge, held at the NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on SpaVLE. The competition focuses on two critical areas: planning and control, where participants explore multi-agent embodied planning using vision-language models (VLMs) to coordinate tasks and policy execution to perform robotic manipulation in dynamic environments. By evaluating solutions submitted by participants, the challenge provides valuable insights into the design and coordination of embodied multi-agent systems, contributing to the future development of advanced collaborative AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>MARS ...</summary><p>MARS Challenge @ NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Space in Vision, Language, and Embodied AI.

This relies on personalized reward models that capture user-specific preferences and automatically provide individualized feedback. However, developing these models faces two critical challenges: the scarcity of feedback from individual users and the need for efficient adaptation to unseen users. We argue that addressing these constraints requires a paradigm shift from fitting data to learn user preferences to learn the process of preference adaptation. To realize this, we propose Meta Reward Modeling (MRM), which reformulates personalized reward modeling as a meta-learning problem. Specifically, we represent each user's reward model as a weighted combination of base reward functions, and optimize the initialization of these weights using a Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)-style framework to support fast adaptation under limited feedback. To ensure robustness, we introduce the Robust Personalization Objective (RPO), which places greater emphasis on hard-to-learn users during meta optimization. Extensive experiments on personalized preference datasets validate that MRM enhances few-shot personalization, improves user robustness, and consistently outperforms baselines.</p></details> |  |

Prior work has focused on parameter fine-tuning techniques, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), to instill these principles. However, these approaches are computationally demanding, require careful engineering and tuning, and often require difficult-to-obtain human annotation data. We propose \textsc{reflect}, an inference-time framework for constitutional alignment that does not require any training or data, providing a plug-and-play approach for aligning an instruction-tuned model to a set of principles. \textsc{reflect} operates entirely in-context, combining a (i) constitution-conditioned base response with post-generation (ii) self-evaluation, (iii)(a) self-critique, and (iii)(b) final revision. \textsc{reflect}'s technique of explicit in-context reasoning over principles during post-generation outperforms standard few-shot prompting and provides transparent reasoning traces. Our results demonstrate that \textsc{reflect} significantly improves LLM conformance to diverse and complex principles, including principles quite distinct from those emphasized in the model's original parameter fine-tuning, without sacrificing factual reasoning. \textsc{reflect} is particularly effective at reducing the rate of rare but significant violations of principles, thereby improving safety and robustness in the tail end of the distribution of generations. Finally, we show that \textsc{reflect} naturally generates useful training data for traditional parameter fine-tuning techniques, allowing for efficient scaling and the reduction of inference-time computational overhead in long-term deployment scenarios.</p></details> |  |

In response, we introduce \texttt{SP3F} (Self-Play with Privileged Pairwise Feedback), a two-stage framework for enhancing multilingual reasoning without \textit{any} data in the target language(s). First, we supervise fine-tune (SFT) on translated versions of English question-answer pairs to raise base model correctness. Second, we perform RL with feedback from a pairwise judge in a self-play fashion, with the judge receiving the English reference response as \textit{privileged information}. Thus, even when none of the model's responses are completely correct, the privileged pairwise judge can still tell which response is better. End-to-end, \texttt{SP3F} greatly improves base model performance, even outperforming fully post-trained models on multiple math and non-math tasks with less than of the training data across the single-language, multilingual, and generalization to unseen language settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/lintangsutawika/SP3F</p></details> |

In this paper, we challenge this orthodoxy. We propose the Exactness Hypothesis: that General Intelligence (AGI), specifically high-order causal inference, requires a computational substrate capable of Arbitrary Precision Arithmetic. We argue that the "hallucinations" and logical incoherence seen in current Large Language Models (LLMs) are artifacts of IEEE 754 floating-point approximation errors accumulating over deep compositional functions. To mitigate this, we introduce the Halo Architecture, a paradigm shift to Rational Arithmetic ($\mathbb{Q}$) supported by a novel Exact Inference Unit (EIU). Empirical validation on the Huginn-0125 prototype demonstrates that while 600B-parameter scale BF16 baselines collapse in chaotic systems, Halo maintains zero numerical divergence indefinitely. This work establishes exact arithmetic as a prerequisite for reducing logical uncertainty in System 2 AGI.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

| **[Mechanistic Analysis of Catastrophic Forgetting in Large Language Models During Continual Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18699v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models exhibit remarkable performance across diverse tasks through pre-training and fine-tuning paradigms. However, continual fine-tuning on sequential tasks induces catastrophic forgetting, where newly acquired knowledge interferes with previously learned capabilities. Despite widespread observations of this phenomenon, the mechanistic understanding remains limited. Here, we present a comprehensive mechanistic analysis of catastrophic forgetting in transformer-based LLMs during sequential fine-tuning. Through systematic experiments across multiple model scales (109B to 400B total parameters) and task sequences, we identify three primary mechanisms driving forgetting: gradient interference in attention weights, representational drift in intermediate layers, and loss landscape flattening. We demonstrate that forgetting severity correlates strongly with task similarity (Pearson r = 0.87) and gradient alignment metrics. Our analysis reveals that approximately 15 to 23 percent of attention heads undergo severe disruption during fine-tuning, with lower layers showing greater susceptibility. These findings establish mechanistic foundations for developing targeted mitigation strategies in continual learning systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 16 figures (6 main + 10 supplementary)</p></details> |

Recent studies suggest that RLVR can elicit strong mathematical reasoning in LLMs through two seemingly paradoxical mechanisms: spurious rewards, which suppress exploitation by rewarding outcomes unrelated to the ground truth, and entropy minimization, which suppresses exploration by pushing the model toward more confident and deterministic outputs, highlighting a puzzling dynamic: both discouraging exploitation and discouraging exploration improve reasoning performance, yet the underlying principles that reconcile these effects remain poorly understood. We focus on two fundamental questions: (i) how policy entropy relates to performance, and (ii) whether spurious rewards yield gains, potentially through the interplay of clipping bias and model contamination. Our results show that clipping bias under spurious rewards reduces policy entropy, leading to more confident and deterministic outputs, while entropy minimization alone is insufficient for improvement. We further propose a reward-misalignment model explaining why spurious rewards can enhance performance beyond contaminated settings. Our findings clarify the mechanisms behind spurious-reward benefits and provide principles for more effective RLVR training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2026</p></details> |

Existing document poisoning attacks, where adversaries inject malicious documents into the knowledge base to manipulate RAG outputs, rely primarily on unrealistic white-box or gray-box assumptions, limiting their practical applicability. To address this gap, we propose CtrlRAG, a two-stage black-box attack that (1) constructs malicious documents containing misinformation or emotion-inducing content and injects them into the knowledge base, and (2) iteratively optimizes them using a localization algorithm and Masked Language Model (MLM) guided on reference context feedback, ensuring their retrieval priority while preserving linguistic naturalness. With only five malicious documents per target question injected into the million-document MS MARCO dataset, CtrlRAG achieves up to 90% attack success rates on commercial LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o), a 30% improvement over optimal baselines, in both *Emotion Manipulation* and *Hallucination Amplification* tasks. Furthermore, we show that existing defenses fail to balance security and performance. To mitigate this challenge, we introduce a dynamic *Knowledge Expansion* defense strategy based on *Parametric/Non-parametric Memory Confrontation*, blocking 78% of attacks while maintaining 95.5% system accuracy. Our findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in RAG systems and provide effective defense strategies.</p></details> |  |

However, visual language models (VLMs) still face heavy computational costs when extended from images to videos due to high frame rates and long durations. Token compression is a promising solution, yet most existing training-free methods cause information loss and performance degradation. To overcome this, we propose \textbf{Memory-Augmented Reinforcement Learning-based Token Compression (MARC)}, which integrates structured retrieval and RL-based distillation. MARC adopts a \textit{retrieve-then-compress} strategy using a \textbf{Visual Memory Retriever (VMR)} to select key clips and a \textbf{Compression Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)} framework to distil reasoning ability from a teacher to a student model. Experiments on six video benchmarks show that MARC achieves near-baseline accuracy using only one frame's tokens -- reducing visual tokens by \textbf{95\%}, GPU memory by \textbf{72\%}, and latency by \textbf{23.9\%}. This demonstrates its potential for efficient, real-time video understanding in resource-constrained settings such as video QA, surveillance, and autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2026</p></details> |

However, there have been concerns regarding the quality and reliability of the generated text, one of which is the citation accuracy and faithfulness. While most recent work relies on methods such as LLM-as-a-Judge, the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge alone is also in doubt. In this work, we reframe citation evaluation as a problem of citation attribution alignment, which assesses whether LLM-generated citations match those a human author would include for the same text. We propose CiteGuard, a retrieval-aware agent framework designed to provide more faithful grounding for citation validation. CiteGuard improves the prior baseline by 17%, and achieves up to 68.1% accuracy on the CiteME benchmark, approaching human-level performance (69.7%). It also enables the identification of alternative but valid citations and demonstrates generalization ability for cross-domain citation attribution.Our code is available at https://github.com/KathCYM/CiteGuard.</p></details> |  |

A key novelty in our approach is the use of LLM-as-a-judge, evaluation of sycophancy as a zero-sum game in a bet setting. Under this framework, sycophancy serves one individual (the user) while explicitly incurring cost on another. Comparing four leading models - Gemini 2.5 Pro, ChatGpt 4o, Mistral-Large-Instruct-2411, and Claude Sonnet 3.7 - we find that while all models exhibit sycophantic tendencies in the common setting, in which sycophancy is self-serving to the user and incurs no cost on others, Claude and Mistral exhibit "moral remorse" and over-compensate for their sycophancy in case it explicitly harms a third party. Additionally, we observed that all models are biased toward the answer proposed last. Crucially, we find that these two phenomena are not independent; sycophancy and recency bias interact to produce `constructive interference' effect, where the tendency to agree with the user is exacerbated when the user's opinion is presented last.</p></details> |  |

The next frontier is using large language models (LLMs) to autonomously create viral micro-videos, a largely untapped potential that could shape the future of AI-driven content creation. To address this gap, this paper presents the first exploration of LLM-assisted popular micro-video generation (LLMPopcorn). We selected popcorn as the icon for this paper because it symbolizes leisure and entertainment, aligning with this study on leveraging LLMs as assistants for generating popular micro-videos that are often consumed during leisure time. Specifically, we empirically study the following research questions: (i) How can LLMs be effectively utilized to assist popular micro-video generation? (ii) To what extent can prompt-based enhancements optimize the LLM-generated content for higher popularity? (iii) How well do various LLMs and video generators perform in the popular micro-video generation task? Exploring these questions, we show that advanced LLMs like DeepSeek-V3 can generate micro-videos with popularity rivaling human content. Prompt enhancement further boosts results, while benchmarking highlights DeepSeek-V3 and R1 for LLMs, and LTX-Video and HunyuanVideo for video generation. This work advances AI-assisted micro-video creation and opens new research directions.

However, existing GR methods primarily focus on direct Semantic ID (SID) generation from interaction sequences, failing to activate deeper reasoning capabilities analogous to those in large language models and thus limiting performance potential. We identify two critical limitations in current reasoning-enhanced GR approaches: (1) Strict sequential separation between reasoning and generation steps creates imbalanced computational focus across hierarchical SID codes, degrading quality for SID codes; (2) Generated reasoning vectors lack interpretable semantics, while reasoning paths suffer from unverifiable supervision. In this paper, we propose stepwise semantic-guided reasoning in latent space (S$^2$GR), a novel reasoning enhanced GR framework. First, we establish a robust semantic foundation via codebook optimization, integrating item co-occurrence relationship to capture behavioral patterns, and load balancing and uniformity objectives that maximize codebook utilization while reinforcing coarse-to-fine semantic hierarchies. Our core innovation introduces the stepwise reasoning mechanism inserting thinking tokens before each SID generation step, where each token explicitly represents coarse-grained semantics supervised via contrastive learning against ground-truth codebook cluster distributions ensuring physically grounded reasoning paths and balanced computational focus across all SID codes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of S$^2$GR, and online A/B test confirms efficacy on large-scale industrial short video platform.</p></details> |  |

However, recent studies reveal a critical constraint: reinforcement learning succeeds only when the base model already assigns non-negligible probability to correct answers -- a property we term 'latent solvability'. This work investigates the emergence of chemical reasoning capabilities and what these prerequisites mean for chemistry. We identify two necessary conditions for RL-based chemical reasoning: 1) Symbolic competence, and 2) Latent chemical knowledge. We propose mid-stage scientific training (MiST): a set of mid-stage training techniques to satisfy these, including data-mixing with SMILES/CIF-aware pre-processing, continued pre-training on 2.9B tokens, and supervised fine-tuning on 1B tokens. These steps raise the latent-solvability score on 3B and 7B models by up to 1.8x, and enable RL to lift top-1 accuracy from 10.9 to 63.9% on organic reaction naming, and from 40.6 to 67.4% on inorganic material generation. Similar results are observed for other challenging chemical tasks, while producing interpretable reasoning traces. Our results define clear prerequisites for chemical reasoning training and highlight the broader role of mid-stage training in unlocking reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |

However, these advancements have also come with significant privacy concerns. While significant research has focused on mitigating the data privacy risks of LLMs during various stages of model training, less attention has been paid to new threats emerging from their deployment. The integration of LLMs into widely used applications and the weaponization of their autonomous abilities have created new privacy vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities provide opportunities for both inadvertent data leakage and malicious exfiltration from LLM-powered systems. Additionally, adversaries can exploit these systems to launch sophisticated, large-scale privacy attacks, threatening not only individual privacy but also financial security and societal trust. In this paper, we systematically examine these emerging privacy risks of LLMs. We also discuss potential mitigation strategies and call for the research community to broaden its focus beyond data privacy risks, developing new defenses to address the evolving threats posed by increasingly powerful LLMs and LLM-powered systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the IEEE Data Engineering Bulletin: http://sites.computer.org/debull/A25dec/issue1.htm</p></details> |

This weakness of MLLMs is currently studied using static benchmarks with fixed visual scenarios, which preempts the possibility of uncovering model-specific or unanticipated hallucination vulnerabilities. We introduce GHOST (Generating Hallucinations via Optimizing Stealth Tokens), a method designed to stress-test MLLMs by actively generating images that induce hallucination. GHOST is fully automatic and requires no human supervision or prior knowledge. It operates by optimizing in the image embedding space to mislead the model while keeping the target object absent, and then guiding a diffusion model conditioned on the embedding to generate natural-looking images. The resulting images remain visually natural and close to the original input, yet introduce subtle misleading cues that cause the model to hallucinate. We evaluate our method across a range of models, including reasoning models like GLM-4.1V-Thinking, and achieve a hallucination success rate exceeding 28%, compared to around 1% in prior data-driven discovery methods. We confirm that the generated images are both high-quality and object-free through quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Also, GHOST uncovers transferable vulnerabilities: images optimized for Qwen2.5-VL induce hallucinations in GPT-4o at a 66.5% rate. Finally, we show that fine-tuning on our images mitigates hallucination, positioning GHOST as both a diagnostic and corrective tool for building more reliable multimodal systems.</p></details> |  |

While some training data is publicly available, substantial investment is required to generate proprietary datasets, such as human preference annotations or to curate new ones from existing sources. As larger datasets generally yield better model performance, two natural questions arise. First, how can data owners make informed decisions about curation strategies and data sources investment? Second, how can multiple data owners collaboratively pool their resources to train superior models while fairly distributing the benefits? This problem, data valuation, which is not specific to large language models, has been addressed by the machine learning community through the lens of cooperative game theory, with the Shapley value being the prevalent solution concept. However, computing Shapley values is notoriously expensive for data valuation, typically requiring numerous model retrainings, which can become prohibitive for large machine learning models. In this work, we demonstrate that this computational challenge is dramatically simplified for LLMs trained with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We show how the specific mathematical structure of DPO enables scalable Shapley value computation. We believe this observation unlocks many applications at the intersection of data valuation and large language models.</p></details> | 11 pages, 2 figures |

While human memory naturally balances retention and forgetting through adaptive decay processes, current AI systems employ binary retention strategies that preserve everything or lose it entirely. We propose FadeMem, a biologically-inspired agent memory architecture that incorporates active forgetting mechanisms mirroring human cognitive efficiency. FadeMem implements differential decay rates across a dual-layer memory hierarchy, where retention is governed by adaptive exponential decay functions modulated by semantic relevance, access frequency, and temporal patterns. Through LLM-guided conflict resolution and intelligent memory fusion, our system consolidates related information while allowing irrelevant details to fade. Experiments on Multi-Session Chat, LoCoMo, and LTI-Bench demonstrate superior multi-hop reasoning and retrieval with 45\% storage reduction, validating the effectiveness of biologically-inspired forgetting in agent memory systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdaReasoner: Dynamic Tool Orchestration for Iterative Visual Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18631v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When humans face problems beyond their immediate capabilities, they rely on tools, providing a promising paradigm for improving visual reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Effective reasoning, therefore, hinges on knowing which tools to use, when to invoke them, and how to compose them over multiple steps, even when faced with new tools or new tasks. We introduce \textbf{AdaReasoner}, a family of multimodal models that learn tool use as a general reasoning skill rather than as tool-specific or explicitly supervised behavior. AdaReasoner is enabled by (i) a scalable data curation pipeline exposing models to long-horizon, multi-step tool interactions; (ii) Tool-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that optimizes tool selection and sequencing based on end-task success; and (iii) an adaptive learning mechanism that dynamically regulates tool usage. Together, these components allow models to infer tool utility from task context and intermediate outcomes, enabling coordination of multiple tools and generalization to unseen tools. Empirically, AdaReasoner exhibits strong tool-adaptive and generalization behaviors: it autonomously adopts beneficial tools, suppresses irrelevant ones, and adjusts tool usage frequency based on task demands, despite never being explicitly trained to do so. These capabilities translate into state-of-the-art performance across challenging benchmarks, improving the 7B base model by +24.9\% on average and surpassing strong proprietary systems such as GPT-5 on multiple tasks, including VSP and Jigsaw.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 10 figures and 13 tables</p></details> |
| **[Assessing the Quality of Mental Health Support in LLM Responses through Multi-Attribute Human Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18630v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The escalating global mental health crisis, marked by persistent treatment gaps, availability, and a shortage of qualified therapists, positions Large Language Models (LLMs) as a promising avenue for scalable support. While LLMs offer potential for accessible emotional assistance, their reliability, therapeutic relevance, and alignment with human standards remain challenging to address. This paper introduces a human-grounded evaluation methodology designed to assess LLM generated responses in therapeutic dialogue. Our approach involved curating a dataset of 500 mental health conversations from datasets with real-world scenario questions and evaluating the responses generated by nine diverse LLMs, including closed source and open source models. More specifically, these responses were evaluated by two psychiatric trained experts, who independently rated each on a 5 point Likert scale across a comprehensive 6 attribute rubric. This rubric captures Cognitive Support and Affective Resonance, providing a multidimensional perspective on therapeutic quality. Our analysis reveals that LLMs provide strong cognitive reliability by producing safe, coherent, and clinically appropriate information, but they demonstrate unstable affective alignment. Although closed source models (e.g., GPT-4o) offer balanced therapeutic responses, open source models show greater variability and emotional flatness. We reveal a persistent cognitive-affective gap and highlight the need for failure aware, clinically grounded evaluation frameworks that prioritize relational sensitivity alongside informational accuracy in mental health oriented LLMs. We advocate for balanced evaluation protocols with human in the loop that center on therapeutic sensitivity and provide a framework to guide the responsible design and clinical oversight of mental health oriented conversational AI.</p></details> |  |

However, extending these capabilities to streaming video inputs, remains challenging, as existing models struggle to simultaneously maintain stable understanding performance, real-time responses, and low GPU memory overhead. To address this challenge, we propose HERMES, a novel training-free architecture for real-time and accurate understanding of video streams. Based on a mechanistic attention investigation, we conceptualize KV cache as a hierarchical memory framework that encapsulates video information across multiple granularities. During inference, HERMES reuses a compact KV cache, enabling efficient streaming understanding under resource constraints. Notably, HERMES requires no auxiliary computations upon the arrival of user queries, thereby guaranteeing real-time responses for continuous video stream interactions, which achieves 10$\times$ faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA. Even when reducing video tokens by up to 68% compared with uniform sampling, HERMES achieves superior or comparable accuracy across all benchmarks, with up to 11.4% gains on streaming datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the market's extreme illiquid and volatile nature, the strategy exposes an exploitable attack surface: adversaries deploy manipulative bots to front-run trades, conceal positions, and fabricate sentiment, systematically extracting value from naïve copiers at scale. Despite its prevalence, bot-driven manipulation remains largely unexplored, and no robust defensive framework exists. We propose a manipulation-resistant copy-trading system based on a multi-agent architecture powered by a multi-modal, explainable large language model (LLM). Our system decomposes copy trading into three specialized agents for coin evaluation, wallet selection, and timing assessment. Evaluated on historical data from over 6,000 meme coins, our approach outperforms zero-shot and most statistic-driven baselines in prediction accuracy as well as all baselines in economic performance, achieving an average return of 14% for identified smart-money trades and an estimated copier return of 3% per trade under realistic market frictions. Overall, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of agent-based defenses and predictability of trader profitability in adversarial meme coin markets, providing a practical foundation for robust copy trading.</p></details> |  |
| **[SMooGPT: Stylized Motion Generation using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04058v2)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stylized motion generation is actively studied in computer graphics, especially benefiting from the rapid advances in diffusion models. The goal of this task is to produce a novel motion respecting both the motion content and the desired motion style, e.g., ``walking in a loop like a Monkey''. Existing research attempts to address this problem via motion style transfer or conditional motion generation. They typically embed the motion style into a latent space and guide the motion implicitly in a latent space as well. Despite the progress, their methods suffer from low interpretability and control, limited generalization to new styles, and fail to produce motions other than ``walking'' due to the strong bias in the public stylization dataset. In this paper, we propose to solve the stylized motion generation problem from a new perspective of reasoning-composition-generation, based on our observations: i) human motion can often be effectively described using natural language in a body-part centric manner, ii) LLMs exhibit a strong ability to understand and reason about human motion, and iii) human motion has an inherently compositional nature, facilitating the new motion content or style generation via effective recomposing. We thus propose utilizing body-part text space as an intermediate representation, and present SMooGPT, a fine-tuned LLM, acting as a reasoner, composer, and generator when generating the desired stylized motion. Our method executes in the body-part text space with much higher interpretability, enabling fine-grained motion control, effectively resolving potential conflicts between motion content and style, and generalizes well to new styles thanks to the open-vocabulary ability of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments and evaluations, and a user perceptual study, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, especially under the pure text-driven stylized motion generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Balanced Neuro-Symbolic Approach for Commonsense Abductive Logic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18595v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive formal reasoning abilities, they often break down when problems require complex proof planning. One promising approach for improving LLM reasoning abilities involves translating problems into formal logic and using a logic solver. Although off-the-shelf logic solvers are in principle substantially more efficient than LLMs at logical reasoning, they assume that all relevant facts are provided in a question and are unable to deal with missing commonsense relations. In this work, we propose a novel method that uses feedback from the logic solver to augment a logic problem with commonsense relations provided by the LLM, in an iterative manner. This involves a search procedure through potential commonsense assumptions to maximize the chance of finding useful facts while keeping cost tractable. On a collection of pure-logical reasoning datasets, from which some commonsense information has been removed, our method consistently achieves considerable improvements over existing techniques, demonstrating the value in balancing neural and symbolic elements when working in human contexts.</p></details> |  |

Eliminating the influence of such problematic datapoints on a model through complete retraining -- by repeatedly pretraining the model on datasets that exclude these specific instances -- is computationally prohibitive. To address this, unlearning algorithms have been proposed, that aim to eliminate the influence of particular datapoints at a low computational cost, while leaving the rest of the model intact. However, precisely unlearning the influence of data on a large language model has proven to be a major challenge. In this work, we propose a new algorithm, MSA (Model State Arithmetic), for unlearning datapoints in large language models. MSA utilizes prior model checkpoints -- artifacts that record model states at different stages of pretraining -- to estimate and counteract the effect of targeted datapoints. Our experimental results show that MSA achieves competitive performance and often outperforms existing machine unlearning algorithms across multiple benchmarks, models, and evaluation metrics, suggesting that MSA could be an effective approach towards more flexible large language models that are capable of data erasure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2026</p></details> |

The models were evaluated through a mixed procedure. Study A involved blinded and non-blinded expert judges in phenomenology and clinical psychology. Assessments included semantic congruence, Jaccard coefficients for overlap of outputs, multidimensional validity ratings of credibility, coherence, and the substantiveness of results, and their grounding in qualitative data. In Study B, neural methods were used to embed the theme descriptions created by humans and the models in a two-dimensional vector space to provide a computational measure of the difference between human and model semantics and linguistic style. In Study C, complementary non-expert evaluations were conducted to examine the influence of thematic verbosity on the perception of human authorship and content validity. Results of all three studies revealed variable overlap with the human analysis, with models being partly indistinguishable from, and also identifying themes originally omitted by, human researchers. The findings highlight both the variability and potential of AI-augmented thematic qualitative analysis to mitigate human interpretative bias and enhance sensitivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 7 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |

In this work, we analyze how stabilizing training dynamics affects the induced generation distribution. We show that under standard maximum likelihood training, stable parameter trajectories lead stationary solutions to approximately minimize the forward KL divergence to the empirical distribution, while implicitly reducing generative entropy. As a consequence, the learned model can concentrate probability mass on a limited subset of empirical modes, exhibiting systematic degeneration despite smooth loss convergence. We empirically validate this effect using a controlled feedback-based training framework that stabilizes internal generation statistics, observing consistent low-entropy outputs and repetitive behavior across architectures and random seeds. It indicates that optimization stability and generative expressivity are not inherently aligned, and that stability alone is an insufficient indicator of generative quality.</p></details> |  |

The advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer novel perspectives for personality detection tasks. Existing approaches enhance personality trait analysis by leveraging LLMs to extract semantic information from textual posts as prompts, followed by training classifiers for categorization. However, accurately classifying personality traits remains challenging due to the inherent complexity of human personality and subtle inter-trait distinctions. Moreover, prompt-based methods often exhibit excessive dependency on expert-crafted knowledge without autonomous pattern-learning capacity. To address these limitations, we view personality detection as a ranking task rather than a classification and propose a corresponding reinforcement learning training paradigm. First, we employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to establish personality trait ranking capabilities while enforcing standardized output formats, creating a robust initialization. Subsequently, we introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a specialized ranking-based reward function. Unlike verification tasks with definitive solutions, personality assessment involves subjective interpretations and blurred boundaries between trait categories. Our reward function explicitly addresses this challenge by training LLMs to learn optimal answer rankings. Comprehensive experiments have demonstrated that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple personality detection benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, AAAI 2026 Bridge</p></details> |

To enable time-efficient insightful retrieval, we propose FastInsight. We first introduce a graph retrieval taxonomy that categorizes existing methods into three fundamental operations: vector search, graph search, and model-based search. Through this taxonomy, we identify two critical limitations in current approaches: the topology-blindness of model-based search and the semantics-blindness of graph search. FastInsight overcomes these limitations by interleaving two novel fusion operators: the Graph-based Reranker (GRanker), which functions as a graph model-based search, and Semantic-Topological eXpansion (STeX), which operates as a vector-graph search. Extensive experiments on broad retrieval and generation datasets demonstrate that FastInsight significantly improves both retrieval accuracy and generation quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a substantial Pareto improvement in the trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> | under review |

However, this capability creates a Safety-Helpfulness Paradox: the reasoning process itself can be misused to justify harmful actions or conceal malicious intent behind lengthy intermediate steps. Most existing benchmarks only check the final output, missing how risks evolve, or ``drift'', during the model's internal reasoning. To address this, we propose SafeRBench, the first framework to evaluate LRM safety end-to-end, from the initial input to the reasoning trace and final answer. Our approach introduces: (i) a Risk Stratification Probing that uses specific risk levels to stress-test safety boundaries beyond simple topics; (ii) Micro-Thought Analysis, a new chunking method that segments traces to pinpoint exactly where safety alignment breaks down; and (iii) a comprehensive suite of 10 fine-grained metrics that, for the first time, jointly measure a model's Risk Exposure (e.g., risk level, execution feasibility) and Safety Awareness (e.g., intent awareness). Experiments on 19 LRMs reveal that while enabling Thinking modes improves safety in mid-sized models, it paradoxically increases actionable risks in larger models due to a strong always-help tendency.</p></details> | 29 pages, 8 figures |

While AoI-based random access is essential for next-generation applications such as the low-altitude economy and indoor service robots, existing strategies, ranging from rule-based protocols to learning-based methods, face critical challenges, including idealized model assumptions, slow convergence, and poor generalization. In this article, we propose Reflex-Core, a novel Large Language Model (LLM) agent-based framework for AoI-driven random access in heterogeneous networks. By devising an "Observe-Reflect-Decide-Execute" closed-loop mechanism, this framework integrates Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to enable optimal, autonomous access control. Based on the Reflex-Core framework, we develop a Reflexive Multiple Access (RMA) protocol and a priority-based RMA variant for intelligent access control under different heterogeneous network settings. Experimental results demonstrate that in the investigated scenarios, the RMA protocol achieves up to a 14.9% reduction in average AoI compared with existing baselines, while the priority-based version improves the convergence rate by approximately 20%.</p></details> |  |

Most existing methods optimize prompts over a fixed dataset, assuming static input distributions and offering limited support for iterative improvement. We introduce SIPDO (Self-Improving Prompts through Data-Augmented Optimization), a closed-loop framework for prompt learning that integrates synthetic data generation into the optimization process. SIPDO couples a synthetic data generator with a prompt optimizer, where the generator produces new examples that reveal current prompt weaknesses and the optimizer incrementally refines the prompt in response. This feedback-driven loop enables systematic improvement of prompt performance without assuming access to external supervision or new tasks. Experiments across question answering and reasoning benchmarks show that SIPDO outperforms standard prompt tuning methods, highlighting the value of integrating data synthesis into prompt learning workflows.</p></details> |  |

While large language models (LLMs) offer zero-shot capabilities, prompting-based approaches often fall short in handling complex reasoning and lack robust generalization to novel targets. Meanwhile, LLM-enhanced methods still require substantial labeled data and struggle to move beyond instance-level patterns, limiting their interpretability and adaptability. Inspired by cognitive science, we propose the Cognitive Inductive Reasoning Framework (CIRF), a schema-driven method that bridges linguistic inputs and abstract reasoning via automatic induction and application of cognitive reasoning schemas. CIRF abstracts first-order logic patterns from raw text into multi-relational schema graphs in an unsupervised manner, and leverages a schema-enhanced graph kernel model to align input structures with schema templates for robust, interpretable zero-shot inference. Extensive experiments on SemEval-2016, VAST, and COVID-19-Stance benchmarks demonstrate that CIRF not only establishes new state-of-the-art results, but also achieves comparable performance with just 30% of the labeled data, demonstrating its strong generalization and efficiency in low-resource settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |

We introduce MOSAIC (MOdular Synthetic Assessment of Instruction Compliance), a modular framework that uses a dynamically generated dataset with up to 20 application-oriented generation constraints to enable a granular and independent analysis of this capability. Our evaluation of five LLMs from different families based on this new benchmark demonstrates that compliance is not a monolithic capability but varies significantly with constraint type, quantity, and position. The analysis reveals model-specific weaknesses, uncovers synergistic and conflicting interactions between instructions, and identifies distinct positional biases such as primacy and recency effects. These granular insights are critical for diagnosing model failures and developing more reliable LLMs for systems that demand strict adherence to complex instructions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted to EACL 2026</p></details> |

However, latent reasoning can be brittle on challenging, out-of-distribution tasks where robust reasoning is most critical. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Latent Thought Policy Optimization (LTPO), a parameter-free framework that enhances LLM reasoning entirely at test time, without requiring model parameter updates. LTPO treats intermediate latent "thought" vectors as dynamic parameters that are actively optimized for each problem instance. It employs an online policy gradient method guided by an intrinsic, confidence-based reward signal computed directly from the frozen LLM's own output distributions, eliminating the need for external supervision or expensive text generation during optimization. Extensive experiments on five reasoning benchmarks show that LTPO not only matches or surpasses strong baselines on standard tasks but also demonstrates remarkable robustness where others fail. Most notably, on highly challenging AIME benchmarks where existing latent reasoning baselines collapse to near-zero accuracy, LTPO delivers substantial improvements, showcasing a unique capability for complex reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2026</p></details> |

Through a systematic audit of 42 recent studies, we identify six pervasive flaws-spanning agent profiles, interaction, memory, control, unawareness, and realism (PIMMUR). Our analysis reveals that 90.7% of studies violate at least one principle, undermining simulation validity. We demonstrate that frontier LLMs correctly identify the underlying social experiment in 47.6% of cases, while 65.3% of prompts exert excessive control that pre-determines outcomes. By reproducing five representative experiments (e.g., telephone game), we show that reported collective phenomena often vanish or reverse when PIMMUR principles are enforced, suggesting that many "emergent" behaviors are methodological artifacts rather than genuine social dynamics. Our findings suggest that current AI simulations may capture model-specific biases rather than universal human social behaviors, raising critical concerns about the use of LLMs as scientific proxies for human society.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Scaling up Privacy-Preserving ML: A CKKS Implementation of Llama-2-7B](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18511v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) become ubiquitous, privacy concerns pertaining to inference inputs keep growing. In this context, fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) has emerged as a primary cryptographic solution to provide non-interactive confidential LLM inference. Existing solutions scale poorly with the input token length, and hence focus either on small models or larger models with a small number of input tokens. They also suffer from the existence of large outlier values. These values have a strong impact on the evaluation of non-linear layers, leading to large-degree polynomial approximation and thus heavy evaluation costs. We propose an FHE-based private LLM inference solution that allows thousands of input tokens with only a part of them being encrypted: this fits with a scenario where the context is benign and only part of the input is sensitive. To do so, we suggest an unbalanced chunked prefill framework that processes the private and public parts of the input tokens differently. Our framework contains plaintext-plaintext, plaintext-ciphertext and ciphertext-ciphertext computational components. We adopt different strategies and ingredients for each component. We also devise new homomorphic algorithms for specific matrix multiplication and polynomial evaluation tasks encountered during LLM inference. Furthermore, without retraining, we tailor the LLM inference algorithm to reduce the ranges of outlier values: we leverage machine learning strategies (token prepending and rotations) to mitigate the impact of the outliers on non-linear layers. Based on these ingredients, we describe a CKKS-based end-to-end implementation of Llama-2-7B private inference for up to 4096 input tokens, of which the last 128 are encrypted. On a cluster of 8~NVIDIA RTX-4090 GPUs, inference takes 85s for summarization and 33s for generation per output token.</p></details> |  |

Drawing on real CEO communications and Moral Foundations Theory, we construct LLM-based participants that simulate the decision-making of individual leaders. Across three phases, we assess construct validity, reliability, and behavioral fidelity by benchmarking these virtual CEOs against human participants. Our results indicate that theoretically scaffolded personas approximate the moral judgements observed in human samples, suggesting that LLM-based personas can serve as credible and complementary tools for organizational research in contexts where direct access to executives is limited. We conclude by outlining implications for future research using LLM-based personas in organizational settings.</p></details> |  |

Conventional reinforcement learning (RL) offers a solution but incurs prohibitive computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. We introduce Just-In-Time Reinforcement Learning (JitRL), a training-free framework that enables test-time policy optimization without any gradient updates. JitRL maintains a dynamic, non-parametric memory of experiences and retrieves relevant trajectories to estimate action advantages on-the-fly. These estimates are then used to directly modulate the LLM's output logits. We theoretically prove that this additive update rule is the exact closed-form solution to the KL-constrained policy optimization objective. Extensive experiments on WebArena and Jericho demonstrate that JitRL establishes a new state-of-the-art among training-free methods. Crucially, JitRL outperforms the performance of computationally expensive fine-tuning methods (e.g., WebRL) while reducing monetary costs by over 30 times, offering a scalable path for continual learning agents. The code is available at https://github.com/liushiliushi/JitRL.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Failure of Latent State Persistence in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10571v5)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning, whether they can sustain persistent latent states remains under-explored. The capacity to maintain and manipulate unexpressed, internal representations-analogous to human working memory-is a cornerstone of complex reasoning. In this paper, we formalize and quantify the "Latent State Persistence" (LSP) gap through three novel experiments. First, we utilize a Number Guessing Game, demonstrating that across independent queries, LLMs fail to allocate probability mass to a singular hidden choice, violating a fundamental probabilistic principle. Second, we employ a Yes-No Game to show that as the number of questions increases, LLMs suffer from "concept drift," leading to inevitable self-contradictions due to the lack of LSP. Finally, inspired by Mathematical Mentalism, we task models with tracking transformations on hidden variables, revealing a failure in variable binding and state evolution when the initial state is not explicitly present in the context. Collectively, these findings suggest that LLMs function as reactive post-hoc solvers rather than proactive planners with LSP. Our work provides a framework for evaluating the fidelity of internal representations and highlights a fundamental architectural divergence between autoregressive transformers and human-like cognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[DV-VLN: Dual Verification for Reliable LLM-Based Vision-and-Language Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18492v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an embodied agent to navigate in a complex 3D environment according to natural language instructions. Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled language-driven navigation with improved interpretability. However, most LLM-based agents still rely on single-shot action decisions, where the model must choose one option from noisy, textualized multi-perspective observations. Due to local mismatches and imperfect intermediate reasoning, such decisions can easily deviate from the correct path, leading to error accumulation and reduced reliability in unseen environments. In this paper, we propose DV-VLN, a new VLN framework that follows a generate-then-verify paradigm. DV-VLN first performs parameter-efficient in-domain adaptation of an open-source LLaMA-2 backbone to produce a structured navigational chain-of-thought, and then verifies candidate actions with two complementary channels: True-False Verification (TFV) and Masked-Entity Verification (MEV). DV-VLN selects actions by aggregating verification successes across multiple samples, yielding interpretable scores for reranking. Experiments on R2R, RxR (English subset), and REVERIE show that DV-VLN consistently improves over direct prediction and sampling-only baselines, achieving competitive performance among language-only VLN agents and promising results compared with several cross-modal systems.Code is available at https://github.com/PlumJun/DV-VLN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Demographic Probing of Large Language Models Lacks Construct Validity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18486v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Demographic probing is widely used to study how large language models (LLMs) adapt their behavior to signaled demographic attributes. This approach typically uses a single demographic cue in isolation (e.g., a name or dialect) as a signal for group membership, implicitly assuming strong construct validity: that such cues are interchangeable operationalizations of the same underlying, demographically conditioned behavior. We test this assumption in realistic advice-seeking interactions, focusing on race and gender in a U.S. context. We find that cues intended to represent the same demographic group induce only partially overlapping changes in model behavior, while differentiation between groups within a given cue is weak and uneven. Consequently, estimated disparities are unstable, with both magnitude and direction varying across cues. We further show that these inconsistencies partly arise from variation in how strongly cues encode demographic attributes and from linguistic confounders that independently shape model behavior. Together, our findings suggest that demographic probing lacks construct validity: it does not yield a single, stable characterization of how LLMs condition on demographic information, which may reflect a misspecified or fragmented construct. We conclude by recommending the use of multiple, ecologically valid cues and explicit control of confounders to support more defensible claims about demographic effects in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Funny or Persuasive, but Not Both: Evaluating Fine-Grained Multi-Concept Control in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18483v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong generative capabilities, but many applications require explicit and \textit{fine-grained} control over specific textual concepts, such as humor, persuasiveness, or formality. Prior approaches in prompting and representation engineering can provide coarse or single-attribute control, but systematic evaluation of multi-attribute settings remains limited. We introduce an evaluation framework for fine-grained controllability for both single- and dual-concept scenarios, focusing on linguistically distinct concept pairs (e.g., persuasiveness vs.~humor). Surprisingly, across multiple LLMs and generative tasks, we find that performance often drops in the dual-concept setting, even though the chosen concepts should in principle be separable. This reveals a fundamental limitation of naive prompting-based control: models struggle with compositionality even when concepts are intuitively independent. Our framework provides systematic evidence of this gap and offers a principled approach for measuring the ability of future methods for multi-concept control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at EACL main conference</p></details> |
| **[STaR: Towards Effective and Stable Table Reasoning via Slow-Thinking Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11233v2)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Table reasoning with large language models (LLMs) plays a critical role in building intelligent systems capable of understanding and analyzing tabular data. Despite recent progress, existing methods still face key limitations: their reasoning processes lacks depth and explicit multi-step reasoning, often relying solely on implicit language model understanding. In addition, their reasoning processes suffer from instability, primarily caused by model uncertainty. In this work, we propose STaR, a novel slow-thinking model that can achieve effective and stable table reasoning. To enable effective multi-step reasoning, we design a two-stage training framework consisting of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) warm-up followed by reinforced fine-tuning (RFT). Specifically, in the SFT stage, we construct a high-quality dataset through automatic self-verification. In the RFT stage, we introduce a difficulty-aware reinforcement learning mechanism to further enhance reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, to improve reasoning stability, we introduce trajectory-level uncertainty quantification, which fuses token-level confidence with answer-level consistency, enabling the selection of better reasoning trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STaR-8B achieves state-of-the-art performance on in-domain benchmarks and exhibits strong generalization to out-of-domain datasets, highlighting its potential for enhancing both effectiveness and stability in table reasoning.</p></details> |  |

We fine tuned Llama 3.1 8B Instruct to learn ontology term identifier mappings from the Human Phenotype Ontology (800 pairs) and the Gene Ontology (400 training pairs), withholding 400 GO pairs to test generalization. Treating learning as a time to event process across 20 epochs, we used stochastic decoding to detect latent knowledge at baseline and Cox proportional hazards models to identify predictors of acquisition, generalization, and degradation. Baseline deterministic recall for HPO was 2.8%, rising to 71.9% after fine-tuning. Latent knowledge was the strongest predictor of faster fact acquisition (HR 2.6) and was associated with earlier, higher peak learning rates and faster convergence; identifier frequency and curated annotation counts had smaller effects. Generalization to withheld GO facts was uncommon (5.8%) but more likely when latent knowledge was present. Previously correct GO mappings degraded more often for withheld (unseen) terms than for trained (seen) terms, suggesting a protective effect of reinforcement during training. These results show that latent knowledge predicts both the speed of factual learning during fine-tuning and the limited generalization of unseen ontology facts, while resistance to degradation depends on whether facts are reinforced.</p></details> |  |
| **[Token-level Collaborative Alignment for LLM-based Generative Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18457v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential for generative recommendation by leveraging rich semantic knowledge. However, existing LLM-based recommender systems struggle to effectively incorporate collaborative filtering (CF) signals, due to a fundamental mismatch between item-level preference modeling in CF and token-level next-token prediction (NTP) optimization in LLMs. Prior approaches typically treat CF as contextual hints or representation bias, and resort to multi-stage training to reduce behavioral semantic space discrepancies, leaving CF unable to explicitly regulate LLM generation. In this work, we propose Token-level Collaborative Alignment for Recommendation (TCA4Rec), a model-agnostic and plug-and-play framework that establishes an explicit optimization-level interface between CF supervision and LLM generation. TCA4Rec consists of (i) Collaborative Tokenizer, which projects raw item-level CF logits into token-level distributions aligned with the LLM token space, and (ii) Soft Label Alignment, which integrates these CF-informed distributions with one-hot supervision to optimize a soft NTP objective. This design preserves the generative nature of LLM training while enabling collaborative alignment with essential user preference of CF models. We highlight TCA4Rec is compatible with arbitrary traditional CF models and generalizes across a wide range of decoder-based LLM recommender architectures. Moreover, it provides an explicit mechanism to balance behavioral alignment and semantic fluency, yielding generative recommendations that are both accurate and controllable. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TCA4Rec consistently improves recommendation performance across a broad spectrum of CF models and LLM-based recommender systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures, 7 tables, WWW 2026</p></details> |
| **[LLM-Enhanced Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Expert Workflow for Real-Time P2P Energy Trading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14995v3)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time peer-to-peer (P2P) electricity markets dynamically adapt to fluctuations in renewable energy and variations in demand, maximizing economic benefits through instantaneous price responses while enhancing grid flexibility. However, scaling expert guidance for massive personalized prosumers poses critical challenges, including diverse decision-making demands and a lack of customized modeling frameworks. This paper proposes an integrated large language model-multi-agent reinforcement learning (LLM-MARL) framework for real-time P2P energy trading to address challenges such as the limited technical capability of prosumers, the lack of expert experience, and security issues of distribution networks. LLMs are introduced as experts to generate personalized strategies, guiding MARL under the centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm through imitation. To handle the scalability issues inherent in large-scale P2P networks, a differential attention-based critic network is introduced to efficiently extract key interaction features and enhance convergence. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-generated strategies effectively substitute human experts. The proposed imitative expert MARL algorithms achieve significantly lower economic costs and voltage violation rates on test sets compared to baseline algorithms, while maintaining robust stability. This paper provides an effective solution for the real-time decision-making of the P2P electricity market by bridging expert knowledge with agent learning.</p></details> |  |

Crash reports provide authentic specifications of safety-critical events, offering a vital alternative to scarce real-world collision trajectory data. This makes them valuable sources for generating realistic high-risk scenarios through simulation. Existing approaches face significant limitations because data-driven methods lack diversity due to their reliance on existing latent distributions, whereas adversarial methods often produce unrealistic scenarios lacking physical fidelity. Large Language Model (LLM) and Vision Language Model (VLM)-based methods show significant promise. However, they suffer from context suppression issues where internal parametric knowledge overrides crash specifications, producing scenarios that deviate from actual accident characteristics. This paper presents SG-CADVLM (A Context-Aware Decoding Powered Vision Language Model for Safety-Critical Scenario Generation), a framework that integrates Context-Aware Decoding with multi-modal input processing to generate safety-critical scenarios from crash reports and road network diagrams. The framework mitigates VLM hallucination issues while enabling the simultaneous generation of road geometry and vehicle trajectories. The experimental results demonstrate that SG-CADVLM generates critical risk scenarios at a rate of 84.4% compared to 12.5% for the baseline methods, representing an improvement of 469%, while producing executable simulations for autonomous vehicle testing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Grouped Lattice Vector Quantizers for Low-Bit LLM Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20984v2)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but typically require extensive computational resources and memory for inference. Post-training quantization (PTQ) can effectively reduce these demands by storing weights in lower bit-width formats. However, standard uniform quantization often leads to notable performance degradation, particularly in low-bit scenarios. In this work, we introduce a Grouped Lattice Vector Quantization (GLVQ) framework that assigns each group of weights a customized lattice codebook, defined by a learnable generation matrix. To address the non-differentiability of the quantization process, we adopt Babai rounding to approximate nearest-lattice-point search during training, which enables stable optimization of the generation matrices. Once trained, decoding reduces to a simple matrix-vector multiplication, yielding an efficient and practical quantization pipeline. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that our approach achieves a better trade-off between model size and accuracy compared to existing post-training quantization baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in deploying large models under stringent resource constraints.

Tensor parallelism (TP) is the state-of-the-art method for reducing LLM response latency, however GPU communications reduces combined token throughput. On the other hand, data parallelism (DP) obtains a higher throughput yet is slow in response latency. Best of both worlds does not exist, and it is not possible to combine TP and DP because of the KV cache variance across the parallelisms. We notice Sequence Parallelism (SP - Ulysses in training) has similar properties as DP but with KV cache invariance. We adapt SP to inference, and combine it with TP to get the best of both worlds. Our solution: Shift Parallelism. Shift Parallelism dynamically switches across TP and SP, and minimizes latency in low traffic without losing throughput in high traffic. The efficient GPU communications of Shift Parallelism yields up to i) 1.51x faster response in interactive workloads and ii) 50% higher throughput in batch workloads, compared to a TP-only solution. We evaluate Shift Parallelism with real-world production traces with dynamic traffic patterns as well as synthetic benchmarking patterns across models, context sizes, and arrival rates. All results affirm the same: Shift Parallelism has a better the latency vs. throughput tradeoff than TP or DP, and hence obtains low latency without degrading throughput in dynamic workloads.</p></details> | Revised |

While post-training methods have become the de facto approach for code agents, **agentic mid-training**-mid-training (MT) on large-scale data that mirrors authentic agentic workflows-remains critically underexplored due to substantial resource requirements, despite offering a more scalable path to instilling foundational agentic behaviors than relying solely on expensive reinforcement learning. A central challenge in realizing effective agentic mid-training is the distribution mismatch between static training data and the dynamic, feedback-rich environment of real development. To address this, we present a systematic study of agentic mid-training, establishing both the data synthesis principles and training methodology for effective agent development at scale. Central to our approach is **agent-native data**-supervision comprising two complementary types of trajectories: **contextually-native trajectories** that preserve the complete information flow an agent experiences, offering broad coverage and diversity; and **environmentally-native trajectories** collected from executable repositories where observations stem from actual tool invocations and test executions, providing depth and interaction authenticity. We verify the model's agentic capabilities on `SWE-Bench Verified`. We demonstrate our superiority over the previous open software engineering mid-training recipe `Kimi-Dev` under two post-training settings with an aligned base model and agentic scaffold, while using less than half mid-training tokens (73.1B). Besides relative advantage, our best performing 32B and 72B models achieve **56.1%** and **58.5%** resolution rates, respectively, which are ...</p></details> |  |

We propose EntroLLM, a compression framework combining mixed quantization and entropy coding to reduce storage while preserving accuracy. We use a combination of unsigned and asymmetric quantization. Tensor-level quantization produces an entropy-reducing effect, increasing weight compressibility, and improving downstream Huffman encoding by $7\times$ (8-bit) and $11.3\times$ (4-bit) over state-of-the-art methods. Huffman coding further reduces memory bandwidth demands, while a parallel decoding strategy enables efficient weight retrieval with minimal latency. Experiments on edge-scale LLMs (smolLM-1.7B, phi3-mini-4k, mistral-7B) show up to $30\%$ storage savings over uint8 and $65\%$ over uint4 models, with $31.9-146.6\%$ faster inference on memory-limited devices like the NVIDIA JETSON P3450. EntroLLM requires no retraining and is compatible with existing post-training quantization pipelines, making it practical for edge LLM deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 1 reference page</p></details> |

On the social web, users frequently have ambiguous and dynamic goals, making complex intent understanding-rather than single-turn execution-the cornerstone of effective human-LLM collaboration. Existing approaches attempt to clarify user intents through sequential or parallel questioning, yet they fall short of addressing the core challenge: modeling the logical dependencies among clarification questions. Inspired by the Cognitive Load Theory, we propose Prism, a novel framework for complex intent understanding that enables logically coherent and efficient intent clarification. Prism comprises four tailored modules: a complex intent decomposition module, which decomposes user intents into smaller, well-structured elements and identifies logical dependencies among them; a logical clarification generation module, which organizes clarification questions based on these dependencies to ensure coherent, low-friction interactions; an intent-aware reward module, which evaluates the quality of clarification trajectories via an intent-aware reward function and leverages Monte Carlo Sample to simulate user-LLM interactions for large-scale,high-quality training data generation; and a self-evolved intent tuning module, which iteratively refines the LLM's logical clarification capability through data-driven feedback and optimization. Prism consistently outperforms existing approaches across clarification interactions, intent execution, and cognitive load benchmarks. It achieves stateof-the-art logical consistency, reduces logical conflicts to 11.5%, increases user satisfaction by 14.4%, and decreases task completion time by 34.8%. All data and code are released.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces the Agentic Reasoning for Methods Orchestration and Reparameterization (ARMOR) framework to address these limitations. ARMOR orchestrates three canonical adversarial primitives, Carlini-Wagner (CW), Jacobian-based Saliency Map Attack (JSMA), and Spatially Transformed Attacks (STA) via Vision Language Models (VLM)-guided agents that collaboratively generate and synthesize perturbations through a shared ``Mixing Desk". Large Language Models (LLMs) adaptively tune and reparameterize parallel attack agents in a real-time, closed-loop system that exploits image-specific semantic vulnerabilities. On standard benchmarks, ARMOR achieves improved cross-architecture transfer and reliably fools both settings, delivering a blended output for blind targets and selecting the best attack or blended attacks for white-box targets using a confidence-and-SSIM score.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and open-source Large Language Models are combined through multi-stage iterative workflows in the system's hybrid LangGraph architecture. The agent constructs an extensive Devito knowledge graph through document parsing, structure-aware segmentation, extraction of entity relationships, and Leiden-based community detection. GraphRAG optimisation enhances query performance across semantic communities that include seismic wave simulation, computational fluid dynamics, and performance tuning libraries. A reverse engineering component derives three-level query strategies for RAG retrieval through static analysis of Fortran source code. To deliver precise contextual information for language model guidance, the multi-stage retrieval pipeline performs parallel searching, concept expansion, community-scale retrieval, and semantic similarity analysis. Code synthesis is governed by Pydantic-based constraints to guarantee structured outputs and reliability. A comprehensive validation framework integrates conventional static analysis with the G-Eval approach, covering execution correctness, structural soundness, mathematical consistency, and API compliance. The overall agent workflow is implemented on the LangGraph framework and adopts concurrent processing to support quality-based iterative refinement and state-aware dynamic routing. The principal contribution lies in the incorporation of feedback mechanisms motivated by reinforcement learning, enabling a transition from static code translation toward dynamic and adaptive analytical behavior.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |

However, many real-world taxonomies introduce ambiguities, such as identical leaf names under similar parent nodes, which prevent language models (LMs) from learning clear decision boundaries. In this paper, we present TaxMorph, a framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to transform entire taxonomies through operations such as renaming, merging, splitting, and reordering. Unlike prior work, our method revises the full hierarchy to better match the semantics encoded by LMs. Experiments across three HTC benchmarks show that LLM-refined taxonomies consistently outperform human-curated ones in various settings up to +2.9pp. in F1. To better understand these improvements, we compare how well LMs can assign leaf nodes to parent nodes and vice versa across human-curated and LLM-refined taxonomies. We find that human-curated taxonomies lead to more easily separable clusters in embedding space. However, the LLM-refined taxonomies align more closely with the model's actual confusion patterns during classification. In other words, even though they are harder to separate, they better reflect the model's inductive biases. These findings suggest that LLM-guided refinement creates taxonomies that are more compatible with how models learn, improving HTC performance.</p></details> |  |

This study presents a comprehensive email dataset containing phishing, spam, and legitimate messages, explicitly distinguishing between human- and LLM-generated content. Each email is annotated with its category, emotional appeal (e.g., urgency, fear, authority), and underlying motivation (e.g., link-following, credential theft, financial fraud). We benchmark multiple LLMs on their ability to identify these emotional and motivational cues and select the most reliable model to annotate the full dataset. To evaluate classification robustness, emails were also rephrased using several LLMs while preserving meaning and intent. A state-of-the-art LLM was then assessed on its performance across both original and rephrased emails using expert-labeled ground truth. The results highlight strong phishing detection capabilities but reveal persistent challenges in distinguishing spam from legitimate emails. Our dataset and evaluation framework contribute to improving AI-assisted email security systems. To support open science, all code, templates, and resources are available on our project site.</p></details> | Changing methodology |

We present a case study for adapter interference in safety-critical domains using a 14B-parameter base model through a two-stage LoRA pipeline: (1) domain-adaptive pre-training (PT) to inject broad medical knowledge via continued pre-training (DAPT), and (2) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to align the model with medical question-answering behaviors through instruction-style data. To balance instruction-following ability and domain knowledge retention, we propose Weighted Adapter Merging, linearly combining SFT and PT adapters before exporting a merged base-model checkpoint. On a held-out medical validation set (F5/F6), the merged model achieves BLEU-4 = 16.38, ROUGE-1 = 20.42, ROUGE-2 = 4.60, and ROUGE-L = 11.54 under a practical decoding configuration. We further analyze decoding sensitivity and training stability with loss curves and controlled decoding comparisons.</p></details> |  |

However, their capabilities to perceive and assess portrait images, a domain characterized by distinct structural and perceptual properties, remain largely underexplored. To this end, we introduce Q-Bench-Portrait, the first holistic benchmark specifically designed for portrait image quality perception, comprising 2,765 image-question-answer triplets and featuring (1) diverse portrait image sources, including natural, synthetic distortion, AI-generated, artistic, and computer graphics images; (2) comprehensive quality dimensions, covering technical distortions, AIGC-specific distortions, and aesthetics; and (3) a range of question formats, including single-choice, multiple-choice, true/false, and open-ended questions, at both global and local levels. Based on Q-Bench-Portrait, we evaluate 20 open-source and 5 closed-source MLLMs, revealing that although current models demonstrate some competence in portrait image perception, their performance remains limited and imprecise, with a clear gap relative to human judgments. We hope that the proposed benchmark will foster further research into enhancing the portrait image perception capabilities of both general-purpose and domain-specific MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

We focus on the use of such models as proxies for theories of cognition that are relatively linguistically-neutral in their representations and learning but differ from current LLMs in key ways. We illustrate this potential use of LLMs as proxies for theories of cognition in the context of two kinds of questions: (a) whether the target theory accounts for the acquisition of a given pattern from a given corpus; and (b) whether the target theory makes a given typologically-attested pattern easier to acquire than another, typologically-unattested pattern. For each of the two questions we show, building on recent literature, how current LLMs can potentially be of help, but we note that at present this help is quite limited.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Fine-Grained Audio-Visual Evidence for Robust Multimodal Emotion Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18321v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal emotion analysis is shifting from static classification to generative reasoning. Beyond simple label prediction, robust affective reasoning must synthesize fine-grained signals such as facial micro-expressions and prosodic which shifts to decode the latent causality within complex social contexts. However, current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) face significant limitations in fine-grained perception, primarily due to data scarcity and insufficient cross-modal fusion. As a result, these models often exhibit unimodal dominance which leads to hallucinations in complex multimodal interactions, particularly when visual and acoustic cues are subtle, ambiguous, or even contradictory (e.g., in sarcastic scenery). To address this, we introduce SABER-LLM, a framework designed for robust multimodal reasoning. First, we construct SABER, a large-scale emotion reasoning dataset comprising 600K video clips, annotated with a novel six-dimensional schema that jointly captures audiovisual cues and causal logic. Second, we propose the structured evidence decomposition paradigm, which enforces a "perceive-then-reason" separation between evidence extraction and reasoning to alleviate unimodal dominance. The ability to perceive complex scenes is further reinforced by consistency-aware direct preference optimization, which explicitly encourages alignment among modalities under ambiguous or conflicting perceptual conditions. Experiments on EMER, EmoBench-M, and SABER-Test demonstrate that SABER-LLM significantly outperforms open-source baselines and achieves robustness competitive with closed-source models in decoding complex emotional dynamics. The dataset and model are available at https://github.com/zxzhao0/SABER-LLM.</p></details> |  |

Simulation- and scenario-based testing have emerged as key approaches to development and validation of autonomous driving systems. Traditional scenario generation relies on rule-based systems, knowledge-driven models, and data-driven synthesis, often producing limited diversity and unrealistic safety-critical cases. With the emergence of foundation models, which represent a new generation of pre-trained, general-purpose AI models, developers can process heterogeneous inputs (e.g., natural language, sensor data, HD maps, and control actions), enabling the synthesis and interpretation of complex driving scenarios. In this paper, we conduct a survey about the application of foundation models for scenario generation and scenario analysis in autonomous driving (as of May 2025). Our survey presents a unified taxonomy that includes large language models, vision-language models, multimodal large language models, diffusion models, and world models for the generation and analysis of autonomous driving scenarios. In addition, we review the methodologies, open-source datasets, simulation platforms, and benchmark challenges, and we examine the evaluation metrics tailored explicitly to scenario generation and analysis. Finally, the survey concludes by highlighting the open challenges and research questions, and outlining promising future research directions. All reviewed papers are listed in a continuously maintained repository, which contains supplementary materials and is available at https://github.com/TUM-AVS/FM-for-Scenario-Generation-Analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Final...</summary><p>Final version (Accepted by the IEEE Open Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems)</p></details> |
| **[CovertComBench: The First Domain-Specific Testbed for LLMs in Wireless Covert Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18315v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into wireless networks presents significant potential for automating system design. However, unlike conventional throughput maximization, Covert Communication (CC) requires optimizing transmission utility under strict detection-theoretic constraints, such as Kullback-Leibler divergence limits. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on general reasoning or standard communication tasks and do not adequately evaluate the ability of LLMs to satisfy these rigorous security constraints. To address this limitation, we introduce CovertComBench, a unified benchmark designed to assess LLM capabilities across the CC pipeline, encompassing conceptual understanding (MCQs), optimization derivation (ODQs), and code generation (CGQs). Furthermore, we analyze the reliability of automated scoring within a detection-theoretic ``LLM-as-Judge'' framework. Extensive evaluations across state-of-the-art models reveal a significant performance discrepancy. While LLMs achieve high accuracy in conceptual identification (81%) and code implementation (83%), their performance in the higher-order mathematical derivations necessary for security guarantees ranges between 18% and 55%. This limitation indicates that current LLMs serve better as implementation assistants rather than autonomous solvers for security-constrained optimization. These findings suggest that future research should focus on external tool augmentation to build trustworthy wireless AI systems.</p></details> | 6pages |

We introduce Climate RADAR (Risk-Aware, Dynamic, and Action Recommendation system), a generative AI-based reliability layer that reframes disaster communication from alerts delivered to actions executed. It integrates meteorological, hydrological, vulnerability, and social data into a composite risk index and employs guardrail-embedded large language models (LLMs) to deliver personalized recommendations across citizen, volunteer, and municipal interfaces. Evaluation through simulations, user studies, and a municipal pilot shows improved outcomes, including higher protective action execution, reduced response latency, and increased usability and trust. By combining predictive analytics, behavioral science, and responsible AI, Climate RADAR advances people-centered, transparent, and equitable early warning systems, offering practical pathways toward compliance-ready disaster resilience infrastructures.</p></details> | 19 pages |

Existing post-training quantization methods typically use small, English-only calibration sets; however, their impact on multilingual models remains underexplored. We systematically evaluate eight calibration settings (five single-language and three multilingual mixes) on two quantizers (GPTQ, AWQ) on data from 10 languages. Our findings reveal a consistent trend: non-English and multilingual calibration sets significantly improve perplexity compared to English-only baselines. Specifically, we observe notable average perplexity gains across both quantizers on Llama3.1 8B and Qwen2.5 7B, with multilingual mixes achieving the largest overall reductions of up to 3.52 points in perplexity. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that tailoring calibration sets to the evaluation language yields the largest improvements for individual languages, underscoring the importance of linguistic alignment. We also identify specific failure cases where certain language-quantizer combinations degrade performance, which we trace to differences in activation range distributions across languages. These results highlight that static one-size-fits-all calibration is suboptimal and that tailoring calibration data, both in language and diversity, plays a crucial role in robustly quantizing multilingual LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EACL 2026 Main Conference</p></details> |

However, existing reviews primarily treat MI as an observational science, summarizing analytical insights while lacking a systematic framework for actionable intervention. To bridge this gap, we present a practical survey structured around the pipeline: "Locate, Steer, and Improve." We formally categorize Localizing (diagnosis) and Steering (intervention) methods based on specific Interpretable Objects to establish a rigorous intervention protocol. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this framework enables tangible improvements in Alignment, Capability, and Efficiency, effectively operationalizing MI as an actionable methodology for model optimization. The curated paper list of this work is available at https://github.com/rattlesnakey/Awesome-Actionable-MI-Survey.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Language Models Conflate Logical Validity with Plausibility: A Representational Analysis of Content Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06700v2)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Both humans and large language models (LLMs) exhibit content effects: biases in which the plausibility of the semantic content of a reasoning problem influences judgments regarding its logical validity. While this phenomenon in humans is best explained by the dual-process theory of reasoning, the mechanisms behind content effects in LLMs remain unclear. In this work, we address this issue by investigating how LLMs encode the concepts of validity and plausibility within their internal representations. We show that both concepts are linearly represented and strongly aligned in representational geometry, leading models to conflate plausibility with validity. Using steering vectors, we demonstrate that plausibility vectors can causally bias validity judgements, and vice versa, and that the degree of alignment between these two concepts predicts the magnitude of behavioral content effects across models. Finally, we construct debiasing vectors that disentangle these concepts, reducing content effects and improving reasoning accuracy. Our findings advance understanding of how abstract logical concepts are represented in LLMs and highlight representational interventions as a path toward more logical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[OntoMetric: An Ontology-Driven LLM-Assisted Framework for Automated ESG Metric Knowledge Graph Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01289v2)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) metric knowledge is inherently structured, connecting industries, reporting frameworks, metric categories, metrics, and calculation models through compositional dependencies, yet in practice this structure remains embedded implicitly in regulatory documents such as SASB, TCFD, and IFRS S2 and rarely exists as an explicit, governed, or machine-actionable artefact. Existing ESG ontologies define formal schemas but do not address scalable population and governance from authoritative regulatory sources, while unconstrained large language model (LLM) extraction frequently produces semantically incorrect entities, hallucinated relationships, and structurally invalid graphs. OntoMetric is an ontology-guided framework for the automated construction and governance of ESG metric knowledge graphs from regulatory documents that operationalises the ESG Metric Knowledge Graph (ESGMKG) ontology as a first-class constraint embedded directly into the extraction and population process. The framework integrates structure-aware segmentation, ontology-constrained LLM extraction enriched with semantic fields and deterministic identifiers, and two-phase validation combining semantic type verification with rule-based schema checking, while preserving segment-level and page-level provenance to ensure traceability to regulatory source text. Evaluation on five ESG regulatory standards shows that ontology-guided extraction achieves 65-90 percent semantic accuracy and over 80 percent schema compliance, compared with 3-10 percent for unconstrained baseline extraction, and yields stable cost efficiency with a cost per validated entity of 0.01-0.02 USD and a 48 times efficiency improvement over baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[Teaching Small Language Models to Learn Logic through Meta-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14313v3)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on reasoning tasks, yet their logical abilities remain contested. To address this, we study LLMs' reasoning in a well-defined fragment of logic: syllogistic reasoning. We cast the problem as premise selection and construct controlled datasets to isolate logical competence. Beyond evaluation, an open challenge is enabling LLMs to acquire abstract inference patterns that generalize to novel structures. We propose to apply few-shot meta-learning to this domain, thereby encouraging models to extract rules across tasks rather than memorize patterns within tasks. Although meta-learning has been little explored in the context of logic learnability, our experiments show that it is effective: small models (1.5B-7B) fine-tuned with meta-learning demonstrate strong gains in generalization, with especially pronounced benefits in low-data regimes. These meta-learned models outperform GPT-4o and o3-mini on our syllogistic reasoning task.</p></details> | EACL 2026 Main |
| **[TriPlay-RL: Tri-Role Self-Play Reinforcement Learning for LLM Safety Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18292v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, safety risks associated with large language models have become increasingly prominent, highlighting the urgent need to mitigate the generation of toxic and harmful content. The mainstream paradigm for LLM safety alignment typically adopts a collaborative framework involving three roles: an attacker for adversarial prompt generation, a defender for safety defense, and an evaluator for response assessment. In this paper, we propose a closed-loop reinforcement learning framework called TriPlay-RL that enables iterative and co-improving collaboration among three roles with near-zero manual annotation. Experimental results show that the attacker preserves high output diversity while achieving a 20%-50% improvement in adversarial effectiveness; the defender attains 10%-30% gains in safety performance without degrading general reasoning capability; and the evaluator continuously refines its fine-grained judgment ability through iterations, accurately distinguishing unsafe responses, simple refusals, and useful guidance. Overall, our framework establishes an efficient and scalable paradigm for LLM safety alignment, enabling continuous co-evolution within a unified learning loop.</p></details> |  |
| **[U-Fold: Dynamic Intent-Aware Context Folding for User-Centric Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18285v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM)-based agents have been successfully deployed in many tool-augmented settings, but their scalability is fundamentally constrained by context length. Existing context-folding methods mitigate this issue by summarizing past interactions, yet they are typically designed for single-query or single-intent scenarios. In more realistic user-centric dialogues, we identify two major failure modes: (i) they irreversibly discard fine-grained constraints and intermediate facts that are crucial for later decisions, and (ii) their summaries fail to track evolving user intent, leading to omissions and erroneous actions. To address these limitations, we propose U-Fold, a dynamic context-folding framework tailored to user-centric tasks. U-Fold retains the full user--agent dialogue and tool-call history but, at each turn, uses two core components to produce an intent-aware, evolving dialogue summary and a compact, task-relevant tool log. Extensive experiments on $τ$-bench, $τ^2$-bench, VitaBench, and harder context-inflated settings show that U-Fold consistently outperforms ReAct (achieving a 71.4% win rate in long-context settings) and prior folding baselines (with improvements of up to 27.0%), particularly on long, noisy, multi-turn tasks. Our study demonstrates that U-Fold is a promising step toward transferring context-management techniques from single-query benchmarks to realistic user-centric applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Think-Augmented Function Calling: Improving LLM Parameter Accuracy Through Embedded Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18282v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in function calling for autonomous agents, yet current mechanisms lack explicit reasoning transparency during parameter generation, particularly for complex functions with interdependent parameters. While existing approaches like chain-of-thought prompting operate at the agent level, they fail to provide fine-grained reasoning guidance for individual function parameters. To address these limitations, we propose Think-Augmented Function Calling (TAFC), a novel framework that enhances function calling accuracy through explicit reasoning at both function and parameter levels. Our method introduces a universal "think" parameter augmentation that enables models to articulate their decision-making process, with dynamic optimization for parameter descriptions to improve reasoning quality. For complex parameters, TAFC automatically triggers granular reasoning based on complexity scoring, ensuring appropriate justification for critical decisions. Additionally, we propose reasoning-guided optimization to align generated reasoning with human expectations. TAFC requires no architectural modifications to existing LLMs while maintaining full API compatibility. Evaluation on ToolBench across proprietary and open-source models demonstrates significant improvements in parameter generation accuracy and reasoning coherence for multi-parameter functions, while providing enhanced interpretability for debugging AI agent behaviors.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Nobody Around Is Real: Exploring Public Opinions and User Experiences On the Multi-Agent AI Social Platform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18275v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Powered by large language models, a new genre of multi-agent social platforms has emerged. Apps such as Social.AI deploy numerous AI agents that emulate human behavior, creating unprecedented bot-centric social networks. Yet, existing research has predominantly focused on one-on-one chatbots, leaving multi-agent AI platforms underexplored. To bridge this gap, we took Social.AI as a case study and performed a two-stage investigation: (i) content analysis of 883 user comments; (ii) a 7-day diary study with 20 participants to document their firsthand platform experiences. While public discourse expressed greater skepticism, the diary study found that users did project a range of social expectations onto the AI agents. While some user expectations were met, the AI-dominant social environment introduces distinct problems, such as attention overload and homogenized interaction. These tensions signal a future where AI functions not merely as a tool or an anthropomorphized actor, but as the dominant medium of sociality itself-a paradigm shift that foregrounds new forms of architected social life.</p></details> |  |

This article introduces a shared dataset of 1446 short texts, each of which describes a research quality score on the UK scale of 1* to 4*. This is a messy collection, with some texts not containing scores and others including invalid scores or strange formats. With this dataset there is also a description of what constitutes a valid score and a "gold standard" of the correct scores for these texts (including missing values). The challenge is to design a prompt for Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract the scores from these texts as accurately as possible. The format for the response should be a number and no other text so there are two aspects to the challenge: ensuring that the LLM returns only a number, and instructing it to deduce the correct number for the text. As part of this, the LLM prompt needs to explain when to return the missing value code, -1, instead of a number when the text does not clearly contain one. The article also provides an example of a simple prompt. The purpose of the challenge is twofold: to get an effective solution to this problem, and to increase understanding of prompt design and LLM capabilities for complex numerical tasks. The initial solution suggested has an accuracy of 72.6%, so the challenge is to beat this.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Automated Kernel Generation in the Era of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15727v2)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of modern AI systems is fundamentally constrained by the quality of their underlying kernels, which translate high-level algorithmic semantics into low-level hardware operations. Achieving near-optimal kernels requires expert-level understanding of hardware architectures and programming models, making kernel engineering a critical but notoriously time-consuming and non-scalable process. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents have opened new possibilities for automating kernel generation and optimization. LLMs are well-suited to compress expert-level kernel knowledge that is difficult to formalize, while agentic systems further enable scalable optimization by casting kernel development as an iterative, feedback-driven loop. Rapid progress has been made in this area. However, the field remains fragmented, lacking a systematic perspective for LLM-driven kernel generation. This survey addresses this gap by providing a structured overview of existing approaches, spanning LLM-based approaches and agentic optimization workflows, and systematically compiling the datasets and benchmarks that underpin learning and evaluation in this domain. Moreover, key open challenges and future research directions are further outlined, aiming to establish a comprehensive reference for the next generation of automated kernel optimization. To keep track of this field, we maintain an open-source GitHub repository at https://github.com/flagos-ai/awesome-LLM-driven-kernel-generation.</p></details> | 10 pages, 1 figure |

We propose Fisher-Guided Gradient Masking (FGGM), a framework that mitigates this by strategically selecting parameters for updates using diagonal Fisher Information. FGGM dynamically generates binary masks with adaptive thresholds, preserving critical parameters to balance stability and plasticity without requiring historical data. Unlike magnitude-based methods such as MIGU, our approach offers a mathematically principled parameter importance estimation. On the TRACE benchmark, FGGM shows a 9.6% relative improvement in retaining general capabilities over supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and a 4.4% improvement over MIGU on TRACE tasks. Additional analysis on code generation tasks confirms FGGM's superior performance and reduced forgetting, establishing it as an effective solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

Intuitively, this flexibility implies a solution space that strictly supersets the fixed autoregressive trajectory, theoretically unlocking superior reasoning potential for general tasks like mathematics and coding. Consequently, numerous works have leveraged reinforcement learning (RL) to elicit the reasoning capability of dLLMs. In this paper, we reveal a counter-intuitive reality: arbitrary order generation, in its current form, narrows rather than expands the reasoning boundary of dLLMs. We find that dLLMs tend to exploit this order flexibility to bypass high-uncertainty tokens that are crucial for exploration, leading to a premature collapse of the solution space. This observation motivates a rethink of RL approaches for dLLMs, where considerable complexities, such as handling combinatorial trajectories and intractable likelihoods, are often devoted to preserving this flexibility. We demonstrate that effective reasoning can be better elicited by intentionally forgoing arbitrary order and applying standard Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) instead. Our approach, JustGRPO, is minimalist yet surprisingly effective (e.g., 89.1% accuracy on GSM8K) while fully retaining the parallel decoding ability of dLLMs. Project page: https://nzl-thu.github.io/the-flexibility-trap</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and pre-trained models: https://github.com/LeapLabTHU/JustGRPO</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Retention: Orchestrating Structural Safety and Plasticity in Continual Learning for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18255v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning in Large Language Models (LLMs) faces the critical challenge of balancing stability (retaining old knowledge) and plasticity (learning new tasks). While Experience Replay (ER) is a standard countermeasure against catastrophic forgetting, its impact across diverse capabilities remains underexplored. In this work, we uncover a critical dichotomy in ER's behavior: while it induces positive backward transfer on robust, unstructured tasks (e.g., boosting performance on previous NLP classification tasks through repeated rehearsal), it causes severe negative transfer on fragile, structured domains like code generation (e.g., a significant relative drop in coding accuracy). This reveals that ER trades structural integrity for broad consolidation. To address this dilemma, we propose \textbf{Orthogonal Subspace Wake-up (OSW)}. OSW identifies essential parameter subspaces of previous tasks via a brief "wake-up" phase and enforces orthogonal updates for new tasks, providing a mathematically grounded "safety guarantee" for established knowledge structures. Empirical results across a diverse four-task sequence demonstrate that OSW uniquely succeeds in preserving fragile coding abilities where Replay fails, while simultaneously maintaining high plasticity for novel tasks. Our findings emphasize the necessity of evaluating structural safety alongside average retention in LLM continual learning.</p></details> |  |

However, this reliance on untrusted user input introduces a novel and underexplored attack surface. In this paper, we investigate the security risks posed by adversarial bug reports -- realistic-looking issue submissions crafted to mislead APR systems into producing insecure or harmful code changes. We develop a comprehensive threat model and conduct an empirical study to evaluate the vulnerability of APR systems to such attacks. Our demonstration comprises 51 adversarial bug reports generated across a spectrum of strategies, ranging from manual curation to fully automated pipelines. We test these against a leading LLM-based APR system and assess both pre-repair defenses (e.g., LlamaGuard variants, PromptGuard variants, Granite-Guardian, and custom LLM filters) and post-repair detectors (GitHub Copilot, CodeQL). Our findings show that current defenses are insufficient: 90% of crafted bug reports triggered attacker-aligned patches. The best pre-repair filter blocked only 47%, while post-repair analysis -- often requiring human oversight -- was effective in just 58% of cases. To support scalable security testing, we introduce a prototype framework for automating the generation of adversarial bug reports. Our analysis exposes a structural asymmetry: generating adversarial inputs is inexpensive, while detecting or mitigating them remains costly and error-prone. We conclude with recommendations for improving the robustness of APR systems against adversarial misuse and highlight directions for future work on secure APR.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, particularly in the context of the Russian language, where no multimodal benchmarks currently exist, we introduce MERA Multi, an open multimodal evaluation framework for Russian-spoken architectures. The benchmark is instruction-based and encompasses default text, image, audio, and video modalities, comprising 18 newly constructed evaluation tasks for both general-purpose models and modality-specific architectures (imageto-text, video-to-text, and audio-to-text). Our contributions include: (i) a universal taxonomy of multimodal abilities; (ii) 18 datasets created entirely from scratch with attention to Russian cultural and linguistic specificity, unified prompts, and metrics; (iii) baseline results for both closed-source and open-source models; (iv) a methodology for preventing benchmark leakage, including watermarking for private sets. While our current focus is on Russian, the proposed benchmark provides a replicable methodology for constructing multimodal benchmarks in typologically diverse languages, particularly within the Slavic language family.</p></details> | EACL main track |

We introduce TAM-Eval (Test Automated Maintenance Evaluation), a framework and benchmark designed to evaluate model performance across three core test maintenance scenarios: creation, repair, and updating of test suites. Unlike prior work limited to function-level tasks, TAM-Eval operates at the test file level, while maintaining access to full repository context during isolated evaluation, better reflecting real-world maintenance workflows. Our benchmark comprises 1,539 automatically extracted and validated scenarios from Python, Java, and Go projects. TAM-Eval supports system-agnostic evaluation of both raw LLMs and agentic workflows, using a reference-free protocol based on test suite pass rate, code coverage, and mutation testing.

| **[V-Loop: Visual Logical Loop Verification for Hallucination Detection in Medical Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18240v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capability in assisting disease diagnosis in medical visual question answering (VQA). However, their outputs remain vulnerable to hallucinations (i.e., responses that contradict visual facts), posing significant risks in high-stakes medical scenarios. Recent introspective detection methods, particularly uncertainty-based approaches, offer computational efficiency but are fundamentally indirect, as they estimate predictive uncertainty for an image-question pair rather than verifying the factual correctness of a specific answer. To address this limitation, we propose Visual Logical Loop Verification (V-Loop), a training-free and plug-and-play framework for hallucination detection in medical VQA. V-Loop introduces a bidirectional reasoning process that forms a visually grounded logical loop to verify factual correctness. Given an input, the MLLM produces an answer for the primary input pair. V-Loop extracts semantic units from the primary QA pair, generates a verification question by conditioning on the answer unit to re-query the question unit, and enforces visual attention consistency to ensure answering both primary question and verification question rely on the same image evidence. If the verification answer matches the expected semantic content, the logical loop closes, indicating factual grounding; otherwise, the primary answer is flagged as hallucinated. Extensive experiments on multiple medical VQA benchmarks and MLLMs show that V-Loop consistently outperforms existing introspective methods, remains highly efficient, and further boosts uncertainty-based approaches when used in combination.</p></details> |  |

This manipulation can manifest in various forms, such as secretly substituting a proclaimed high-performance model with a low-cost alternative, or inflating responses with meaningless tokens to increase billing. This work tackles the issue through the lens of algorithmic game theory and mechanism design. We are the first to propose a formal economic model for a realistic user-provider ecosystem, where a user can iteratively delegate $T$ queries to multiple model providers, and providers can engage in a range of strategic behaviors. As our central contribution, we prove that for a continuous strategy space and any $ε\in(0,\frac12)$, there exists an approximate incentive-compatible mechanism with an additive approximation ratio of $O(T^{1-ε}\log T)$, and a guaranteed quasi-linear second-best user utility. We also prove an impossibility result, stating that no mechanism can guarantee an expected user utility that is asymptotically better than our mechanism. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our mechanism in simulation experiments with real-world API settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in WWW 2026; 12 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |

To perform thorough, user-tailored product searches, agents should interpret personal preferences, engage in multi-turn dialogues, and ultimately retrieve and discriminate among highly similar products. However, existing research has yet to provide a unified simulation environment that consistently captures all of these aspects, and always focuses solely on evaluation benchmarks without training support. In this paper, we introduce ShopSimulator, a large-scale and challenging Chinese shopping environment. Leveraging ShopSimulator, we evaluate LLMs across diverse scenarios, finding that even the best-performing models achieve less than 40% full-success rate. Error analysis reveals that agents struggle with deep search and product selection in long trajectories, fail to balance the use of personalization cues, and to effectively engage with users. Further training exploration provides practical guidance for overcoming these weaknesses, with the combination of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) yielding significant performance improvements. Code and data will be released at https://github.com/ShopAgent-Team/ShopSimulator.</p></details> |  |

However, IKE relies on lengthy, fact-specific demonstrations which are costly to create and consume significant context window space. In this paper, we introduce persuasion tokens (P-Tokens) -- special tokens trained to replicate the effect of IKE demonstrations, enabling efficient knowledge editing without requiring fact-specific demonstrations. We evaluate P-Tokens across two editing datasets and three LLMs, demonstrating performance comparable to, and often exceeding, IKE. We further find that editing performance is robust to distractors with small negative effects to neighboring facts, and that increasing the number of P-Tokens improves performance. Our work addresses key limitations of IKE and provides a more practical and scalable alternative for editing LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EACL Main 2026</p></details> |

The multilingual speech understanding and long-sequence processing abilities of speech large language models (SLLMs) make them promising for FA in multilingual, crosslingual, and long-form speech settings. However, directly applying the next-token prediction paradigm of SLLMs to FA results in hallucinations and slow inference. To bridge the gap, we propose LLM-ForcedAligner, reformulating FA as a slot-filling paradigm: timestamps are treated as discrete indices, and special timestamp tokens are inserted as slots into the transcript. Conditioned on the speech embeddings and the transcript with slots, the SLLM directly predicts the time indices at slots. During training, causal attention masking with non-shifted input and label sequences allows each slot to predict its own timestamp index based on itself and preceding context, with loss computed only at slot positions. Dynamic slot insertion enables FA at arbitrary positions. Moreover, non-autoregressive inference is supported, avoiding hallucinations and improving speed. Experiments across multilingual, crosslingual, and long-form speech scenarios show that LLM-ForcedAligner achieves a 69%~78% relative reduction in accumulated averaging shift compared with prior methods. The checkpoint and inference code will be released later.</p></details> |  |

To enable time-efficient insightful retrieval, we propose FastInsight. We first introduce a graph retrieval taxonomy that categorizes existing methods into three fundamental operations: vector search, graph search, and model-based search. Through this taxonomy, we identify two critical limitations in current approaches: the topology-blindness of model-based search and the semantics-blindness of graph search. FastInsight overcomes these limitations by interleaving two novel fusion operators: the Graph-based Reranker (GRanker), which functions as a graph model-based search, and Semantic-Topological eXpansion (STeX), which operates as a vector-graph search. Extensive experiments on broad retrieval and generation datasets demonstrate that FastInsight significantly improves both retrieval accuracy and generation quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a substantial Pareto improvement in the trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Orchestrating Specialized Agents for Trustworthy Enterprise RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18267v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) shows promise for enterprise knowledge work, yet it often underperforms in high-stakes decision settings that require deep synthesis, strict traceability, and recovery from underspecified prompts. One-pass retrieval-and-write pipelines frequently yield shallow summaries, inconsistent grounding, and weak mechanisms for completeness verification. We introduce ADORE (Adaptive Deep Orchestration for Research in Enterprise), an agentic framework that replaces linear retrieval with iterative, user-steered investigation coordinated by a central orchestrator and a set of specialized agents. ADORE's key insight is that a structured Memory Bank (a curated evidence store with explicit claim-evidence linkage and section-level admissible evidence) enables traceable report generation and systematic checks for evidence completeness. Our contributions are threefold: (1) Memory-locked synthesis - report generation is constrained to a structured Memory Bank (Claim-Evidence Graph) with section-level admissible evidence, enabling traceable claims and grounded citations; (2) Evidence-coverage-guided execution - a retrieval-reflection loop audits section-level evidence coverage to trigger targeted follow-up retrieval and terminates via an evidence-driven stopping criterion; (3) Section-packed long-context grounding - section-level packing, pruning, and citation-preserving compression make long-form synthesis feasible under context limits. Across our evaluation suite, ADORE ranks first on DeepResearch Bench (52.65) and achieves the highest head-to-head preference win rate on DeepConsult (77.2%) against commercial systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[What Should I Cite? A RAG Benchmark for Academic Citation Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14949v2)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of Web-based academic publications, more and more papers are being published annually, making it increasingly difficult to find relevant prior work. Citation prediction aims to automatically suggest appropriate references, helping scholars navigate the expanding scientific literature. Here we present \textbf{CiteRAG}, the first comprehensive retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-integrated benchmark for evaluating large language models on academic citation prediction, featuring a multi-level retrieval strategy, specialized retrievers, and generators. Our benchmark makes four core contributions: (1) We establish two instances of the citation prediction task with different granularity. Task 1 focuses on coarse-grained list-specific citation prediction, while Task 2 targets fine-grained position-specific citation prediction. To enhance these two tasks, we build a dataset containing 7,267 instances for Task 1 and 8,541 instances for Task 2, enabling comprehensive evaluation of both retrieval and generation. (2) We construct a three-level large-scale corpus with 554k papers spanning many major subfields, using an incremental pipeline. (3) We propose a multi-level hybrid RAG approach for citation prediction, fine-tuning embedding models with contrastive learning to capture complex citation relationships, paired with specialized generation models. (4) We conduct extensive experiments across state-of-the-art language models, including closed-source APIs, open-source models, and our fine-tuned generators, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework. Our open-source toolkit enables reproducible evaluation and focuses on academic literature, providing the first comprehensive evaluation framework for citation prediction and serving as a methodological template for other scientific domains.

| **[Augmenting Question Answering with A Hybrid RAG Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12658v2)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing the quality of responses in Question-Answering (QA) tasks. However, existing approaches often struggle with retrieving contextually relevant information, leading to incomplete or suboptimal answers. In this paper, we introduce Structured-Semantic RAG (SSRAG), a hybrid architecture that enhances QA quality by integrating query augmentation, agentic routing, and a structured retrieval mechanism combining vector and graph based techniques with context unification. By refining retrieval processes and improving contextual grounding, our approach improves both answer accuracy and informativeness. We conduct extensive evaluations on three popular QA datasets, TruthfulQA, SQuAD and WikiQA, across five Large Language Models (LLMs), demonstrating that our proposed approach consistently improves response quality over standard RAG implementations.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 tables, 2 figures; presented at IEEE CogMI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Less is More for RAG: Information Gain Pruning for Generator-Aligned Reranking and Evidence Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17532v1)** | 2026-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) grounds large language models with external evidence, but under a limited context budget, the key challenge is deciding which retrieved passages should be injected. We show that retrieval relevance metrics (e.g., NDCG) correlate weakly with end-to-end QA quality and can even become negatively correlated under multi-passage injection, where redundancy and mild conflicts destabilize generation. We propose \textbf{Information Gain Pruning (IGP)}, a deployment-friendly reranking-and-pruning module that selects evidence using a generator-aligned utility signal and filters weak or harmful passages before truncation, without changing existing budget interfaces. Across five open-domain QA benchmarks and multiple retrievers and generators, IGP consistently improves the quality--cost trade-off. In a representative multi-evidence setting, IGP delivers about +12--20% relative improvement in average F1 while reducing final-stage input tokens by roughly 76--79% compared to retriever-only baselines.</p></details> | 26 pages, 10 figures |

However, GFMs remain constrained by in-memory bottlenecks: they attempt to encode knowledge into model parameters, which limits semantic capacity, introduces heavy lossy compression with conflicts, and entangles graph representation with the knowledge in ways that hinder efficient adaptation, undermining scalability and interpretability. In this work,we propose RAG-GFM, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation aided Graph Foundation Model that offloads knowledge from parameters and complements parameterized learning. To externalize graph knowledge, we build a dual-modal unified retrieval module, where a semantic store from prefix-structured text and a structural store from centrality-based motif. To preserve heterogeneous information, we design a dual-view alignment objective that contrasts both modalities to capture both content and relational patterns. To enable efficient downstream adaptation, we perform in-context augmentation to enrich supporting instances with retrieved texts and motifs as contextual evidence. Extensive experiments on five benchmark graph datasets demonstrate that RAG-GFM consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art baselines in both cross-domain node and graph classification, achieving superior effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the Web Conference 2026 (Research Track)</p></details> |

The quality of generated content heavily relies on the usefulness of the retrieved information and the capacity of LLMs' internal information processing mechanism to incorporate it in answer generation. It is generally assumed that the retrieved information is relevant to the question. However, the retrieved information may have a variable degree of relevance and usefulness, depending on the question and the document collection. It is important to take into account the relevance of the retrieved information in answer generation. In this paper, we propose OpenDecoder, a new approach that leverages explicit evaluation of the retrieved information as quality indicator features for generation. We aim to build a RAG model that is more robust to varying levels of noisy context. Three types of explicit evaluation information are considered: relevance score, ranking score, and QPP (query performance prediction) score. The experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and better robustness of OpenDecoder by outperforming various baseline methods. Importantly, this paradigm is flexible to be integrated with the post-training of LLMs for any purposes and incorporated with any type of external indicators.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM WWW 2026</p></details> |
| **[DF-RAG: Query-Aware Diversity for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17212v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a common technique for grounding language model outputs in domain-specific information. However, RAG is often challenged by reasoning-intensive question-answering (QA), since common retrieval methods like cosine similarity maximize relevance at the cost of introducing redundant content, which can reduce information recall. To address this, we introduce Diversity-Focused Retrieval-Augmented Generation (DF-RAG), which systematically incorporates diversity into the retrieval step to improve performance on complex, reasoning-intensive QA benchmarks. DF-RAG builds upon the Maximal Marginal Relevance framework to select information chunks that are both relevant to the query and maximally dissimilar from each other. A key innovation of DF-RAG is its ability to optimize the level of diversity for each query dynamically at test time without requiring any additional fine-tuning or prior information. We show that DF-RAG improves F1 performance on reasoning-intensive QA benchmarks by 4-10 percent over vanilla RAG using cosine similarity and also outperforms other established baselines. Furthermore, we estimate an Oracle ceiling of up to 18 percent absolute F1 gains over vanilla RAG, of which DF-RAG captures up to 91.3 percent.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Findings of EACL 2026</p></details> |

Existing datasets often rely on general-domain corpora or purely textual retrieval, failing to capture the complexity of specialized technical documents where information is inextricably multimodal and reasoning requires synthesizing disjoint evidence. We address this gap by introducing MiRAGE, a Multiagent framework for RAG systems Evaluation, that leverages a collaborative swarm of specialized agents to generate verified, domain-specific, multimodal, and multi-hop Question-Answer datasets. MiRAGE orchestrates a swarm of specialized agents: a recursive context optimization loop to aggregate scattered evidence, an adversarial verifier agent to guarantee factual grounding, and an agent to recognize the expert persona and the relevant domain to mimic expert cognitive workflows. Extensive empirical evaluation across four distinct domains (regulations, finance, quantitative biology, and journalism) demonstrates that MiRAGE generates datasets with significantly higher reasoning complexity (>2.3 average hops) and factual faithfulness. Our ablation studies point that MiRAGE can be powered by LLMs if textual descriptions of the images are available. Visual grounding still remains a frontier. By automating the creation of gold standard evaluation datasets that reflect the latent thematic structure of proprietary corpora, MiRAGE provides the necessary infrastructure to rigorously benchmark the next generation information retrieval systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, Submitted to ACL</p></details> |
| **[Chunking, Retrieval, and Re-ranking: An Empirical Evaluation of RAG Architectures for Policy Document Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15457v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into the public health policy sector offers a transformative approach to navigating the vast repositories of regulatory guidance maintained by agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). However, the propensity for LLMs to generate hallucinations, defined as plausible but factually incorrect assertions, presents a critical barrier to the adoption of these technologies in high-stakes environments where information integrity is non-negotiable. This empirical evaluation explores the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures in mitigating these risks by grounding generative outputs in authoritative document context. Specifically, this study compares a baseline Vanilla LLM against Basic RAG and Advanced RAG pipelines utilizing cross-encoder re-ranking. The experimental framework employs a Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 model and an all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embedding model to process a corpus of official CDC policy analytical frameworks and guidance documents. The analysis measures the impact of two distinct chunking strategies, recursive character-based and token-based semantic splitting, on system accuracy, measured through faithfulness and relevance scores across a curated set of complex policy scenarios. Quantitative findings indicate that while Basic RAG architectures provide a substantial improvement in faithfulness (0.621) over Vanilla baselines (0.347), the Advanced RAG configuration achieves a superior faithfulness average of 0.797. These results demonstrate that two-stage retrieval mechanisms are essential for achieving the precision required for domain-specific policy question answering, though structural constraints in document segmentation remain a significant bottleneck for multi-step reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Domain-Specific Knowledge Graphs in RAG-Enhanced Healthcare LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15429v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) generate fluent answers but can struggle with trustworthy, domain-specific reasoning. We evaluate whether domain knowledge graphs (KGs) improve Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for healthcare by constructing three PubMed-derived graphs: $\mathbb{G}_1$ (T2DM), $\mathbb{G}_2$ (Alzheimer's disease), and $\mathbb{G}_3$ (AD+T2DM). We design two probes: Probe 1 targets merged AD T2DM knowledge, while Probe 2 targets the intersection of $\mathbb{G}_1$ and $\mathbb{G}_2$. Seven instruction-tuned LLMs are tested across retrieval sources {No-RAG, $\mathbb{G}_1$, $\mathbb{G}_2$, $\mathbb{G}_1$ + $\mathbb{G}_2$, $\mathbb{G}_3$, $\mathbb{G}_1$+$\mathbb{G}_2$ + $\mathbb{G}_3$} and three decoding temperatures. Results show that scope alignment between probe and KG is decisive: precise, scope-matched retrieval (notably $\mathbb{G}_2$) yields the most consistent gains, whereas indiscriminate graph unions often introduce distractors that reduce accuracy. Larger models frequently match or exceed KG-RAG with a No-RAG baseline on Probe 1, indicating strong parametric priors, whereas smaller/mid-sized models benefit more from well-scoped retrieval. Temperature plays a secondary role; higher values rarely help. We conclude that precision-first, scope-matched KG-RAG is preferable to breadth-first unions, and we outline practical guidelines for graph selection, model sizing, and retrieval/reranking.

Most notably, indirect prompt injection and retrieval poisoning attack the web-native carriers that survive ingestion pipelines and are very concerning. We provide OpenRAG-Soc, a compact, reproducible benchmark-and-harness for web-facing RAG evaluation under these threats, in a discrete data package. The suite combines a social corpus with interchangeable sparse and dense retrievers and deployable mitigations - HTML/Markdown sanitization, Unicode normalization, and attribution-gated answered. It standardizes end-to-end evaluation from ingestion to generation and reports attacks time of one of the responses at answer time, rank shifts in both sparse and dense retrievers, utility and latency, allowing for apples-to-apples comparisons across carriers and defenses. OpenRAG-Soc targets practitioners who need fast, and realistic tests to track risk and harden deployments.</p></details> | WWW 2026 |

The challenge aims to address a critical limitation of modern Vision Language Models (VLMs): their propensity to hallucinate, especially when faced with egocentric imagery, long-tail entities, and complex, multi-hop questions. This issue is particularly problematic in real-world applications where users pose fact-seeking queries that demand high factual accuracy across diverse modalities. To tackle this, we propose a robust, multi-stage framework that prioritizes factual accuracy and truthfulness over completeness. Our solution integrates a lightweight query router for efficiency, a query-aware retrieval and summarization pipeline, a dual-pathways generation and a post-hoc verification. This conservative strategy is designed to minimize hallucinations, which incur a severe penalty in the competition's scoring metric. Our approach achieved 3rd place in Task 1, demonstrating the effectiveness of prioritizing answer reliability in complex multi-modal RAG systems.

Most existing design methods focus on vector-valued responses (e.g., Young's modulus and bandgap width), while the inverse design of functional responses remains challenging due to their high-dimensionality, the complexity of accommodating design requirements in inverse-design frameworks, and non-existence or non-uniqueness of feasible solutions. Although generative design approaches have shown promise, they are often data-hungry, handle design requirements heuristically, and may generate infeasible designs without uncertainty quantification. To address these challenges, we introduce a RAndom-forest-based Generative approach (RAG). By leveraging the small-data compatibility of random forests, RAG enables data-efficient predictions of high-dimensional functional responses. During the inverse design, the framework estimates the likelihood through the ensemble which quantifies the trustworthiness of generated designs while reflecting the relative difficulty across different requirements. The one-to-many mapping is addressed through single-shot design generation by sampling from the conditional likelihood. We demonstrate RAG on: 1) acoustic metamaterials with prescribed partial passbands/stopbands, and 2) mechanical metamaterials with targeted snap-through responses, using 500 and 1057 samples, respectively. Its data-efficiency is benchmarked against neural networks on a public mechanical metamaterial dataset with nonlinear stress-strain relations. Our framework provides a lightweight, trustworthy pathway to inverse design involving functional responses, expensive simulations, and complex design requirements, beyond metamaterials.</p></details> |  |
| **[Insider Knowledge: How Much Can RAG Systems Gain from Evaluation Secrets?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13227v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RAG systems are increasingly evaluated and optimized using LLM judges, an approach that is rapidly becoming the dominant paradigm for system assessment. Nugget-based approaches in particular are now embedded not only in evaluation frameworks but also in the architectures of RAG systems themselves. While this integration can lead to genuine improvements, it also creates a risk of faulty measurements due to circularity. In this paper, we investigate this risk through comparative experiments with nugget-based RAG systems, including Ginger and Crucible, against strong baselines such as GPT-Researcher. By deliberately modifying Crucible to generate outputs optimized for an LLM judge, we show that near-perfect evaluation scores can be achieved when elements of the evaluation - such as prompt templates or gold nuggets - are leaked or can be predicted. Our results highlight the importance of blind evaluation settings and methodological diversity to guard against mistaking metric overfitting for genuine system progress.</p></details> |  |

However, co-locating the vector retriever and the LLM on shared GPU infrastructure introduces significant challenges: vector search is memory and I/O intensive, while LLM inference demands high throughput and low latency. Naive resource sharing often leads to severe performance degradation, particularly under high request load or large index sizes. We present VectorLiteRAG, a deployment-friendly RAG system that achieves latency-compliant inference without requiring additional hardware resources. VectorLiteRAG introduces a fine-grained GPU resource allocation mechanism based on detailed performance modeling and access pattern analysis. By estimating search latency and query hit rate distributions, it identifies an optimal index partitioning point across CPU and GPU tiers to minimize contention and maximize throughput. Our evaluations show that VectorLiteRAG consistently expands the SLO compliant request rate range across all tested configurations, including both small and large LLMs, and small and large vector databases compared to naive baselines and state of the art alternatives. In the best case, VectorLiteRAG improves the attainable SLO throughput by up to 1.5 times without compromising generation quality or requiring additional compute resources.</p></details> |  |

However, the performance of a RAG system is not determined by a single component but emerges from a complex interplay of modular choices, such as embedding models and retrieval algorithms. This creates a vast and often opaque configuration space, making it challenging for developers to understand performance trade-offs and identify optimal designs. To address this challenge, we present RAGExplorer, a visual analytics system for the systematic comparison and diagnosis of RAG configurations. RAGExplorer guides users through a seamless macro-to-micro analytical workflow. Initially, it empowers developers to survey the performance landscape across numerous configurations, allowing for a high-level understanding of which design choices are most effective. For a deeper analysis, the system enables users to drill down into individual failure cases, investigate how differences in retrieved information contribute to errors, and interactively test hypotheses by manipulating the provided context to observe the resulting impact on the generated answer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RAGExplorer through detailed case studies and user studies, validating its ability to empower developers in navigating the complex RAG design space.

This increase leads to higher computational costs and longer Time to First Token (TTFT). To mitigate this issue, existing solutions aim to reuse the preprocessed KV cache of each retrieved chunk to accelerate RAG. However, the lack of cross-chunk contextual information leads to a significant drop in generation quality, leaving the potential benefits of KV cache reuse largely unfulfilled. The challenge lies in how to reuse the precomputed KV cache of chunks while preserving generation quality. We propose FusionRAG, a novel inference framework that optimizes both the preprocessing and reprocessing stages of RAG. In the offline preprocessing stage, we embed information from other related text chunks into each chunk, while in the online reprocessing stage, we recompute the KV cache for tokens that the model focuses on. As a result, we achieve a better trade-off between generation quality and efficiency. According to our experiments, FusionRAG significantly improves generation quality at the same recomputation ratio compared to previous state-of-the-art solutions. By recomputing fewer than 15% of the tokens, FusionRAG achieves up to 70% higher normalized F1 scores than baselines and reduces TTFT by 2.66x-9.39x compared to Full Attention.</p></details> |  |
| **[Principled Context Engineering for RAG: Statistical Guarantees via Conformal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17908v2)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances factual grounding in large language models (LLMs) by incorporating retrieved evidence, but LLM accuracy declines when long or noisy contexts exceed the model's effective attention span. Existing pre-generation filters rely on heuristics or uncalibrated LLM confidence scores, offering no statistical control over retained evidence. We evaluate and demonstrate context engineering through conformal prediction, a coverage-controlled filtering framework that removes irrelevant content while preserving recall of supporting evidence. Using both embedding- and LLM-based scoring functions, we test this approach on the NeuCLIR and RAGTIME collections. Conformal filtering consistently meets its target coverage, ensuring that a specified fraction of relevant snippets are retained, and reduces retained context by 2-3x relative to unfiltered retrieval. On NeuCLIR, downstream factual accuracy measured by ARGUE F1 improves under strict filtering and remains stable at moderate coverage, indicating that most discarded material is redundant or irrelevant. These results demonstrate that conformal prediction enables reliable, coverage-controlled context reduction in RAG, offering a model-agnostic and principled approach to context engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECIR 2026</p></details> |

Stakeholders require traceable evidence, clear rationales for why specific evidence is selected, and safeguards against poisoned or misleading content. Yet current RAG pipelines rely on similarity-based retrieval with arbitrary top-k cutoffs, provide no explanation for selections, and remain vulnerable to poisoning attacks. We propose METEORA, which replaces these drawbacks with rationale-driven selection, using explicit reasoning to guide evidence choice, explain decisions, and improve robustness to RAG poisoning. METEORA operates in three stages: (1) a general-purpose LLM is preference-tuned to generate query-conditioned rationales using direct preference optimization; (2) these rationales drive an Evidence Chunk Selection Engine that pairs rationales with retrieved evidence for query-specific relevance and applies elbow detection to choose an adaptive cutoff (optionally expanding context with neighboring chunks); and (3) a Verifier LLM uses the rationales to detect and filter poisoned or misleading evidence before generation. Across six datasets, METEORA achieves 13.41% higher recall and, without expansion, 21.05% higher precision than the strongest baseline. It reduces the evidence needed for comparable recall by 80%, improving downstream answer accuracy by 33.34%, and strengthens adversarial defense by increasing F1 from 0.10 to 0.44. Code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/METEORA-DC46/README.md</p></details> |  |

Out-of-domain (OOD) queries can cause dense retrieval to surface weakly related context and lead the generator to produce fluent but unjustified responses. We study lightweight, KB-aligned OOD detection as an always-on gate for RAG systems. Our approach applies PCA to KB embeddings and scores queries in a compact subspace selected either by explained-variance retention (EVR) or by a separability-driven t-test ranking. We evaluate geometric semantic-search rules and lightweight classifiers across 16 domains, including high-stakes COVID-19 and Substance Use KBs, and stress-test robustness using both LLM-generated attacks and an in-the-wild 4chan attack. We find that low-dimensional detectors achieve competitive OOD performance while being faster, cheaper, and more interpretable than prompted LLM-based judges. Finally, human and LLM-based evaluations show that OOD queries primarily degrade the relevance of RAG outputs, showing the need for efficient external OOD detection to maintain safe, in-scope behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Effective and Unsupervised Social Event Detection and Evolution via RAG and Structural Entropy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12035v1)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing scale of social media, social event detection and evolution modeling have attracted increasing attention. Graph neural networks (GNNs) and transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs) have become mainstream approaches in this area. However, existing methods still face three major challenges. First, the sheer volume of social media messages makes learning resource-intensive. Second, the fragmentation of social media messages often impedes the model's ability to capture a comprehensive view of the events. Third, the lack of structured temporal context has hindered the development of effective models for event evolution, limiting users' access to event information. To address these challenges, we propose a foundation model for unsupervised Social Event Detection and Evolution, namely RagSEDE. Specifically, RagSEDE introduces a representativeness- and diversity-driven sampling strategy to extract key messages from massive social streams, significantly reducing noise and computational overhead. It further establishes a novel paradigm based on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that enhances PLMs in detecting events while simultaneously constructing and maintaining an evolving event knowledge base. Finally, RagSEDE leverages structural information theory to dynamically model event evolution keywords for the first time. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the superiority of RagSEDE in open-world social event detection and evolution.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, accepted for The Web Conference (WWW) 2026</p></details> |

A Fact-Checking Dataset for Evaluating the Robustness of RAG Against Misleading Retrievals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16101v5)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has shown impressive capabilities in mitigating hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs struggle to maintain consistent reasoning when exposed to misleading or conflicting evidence, especially in real-world domains such as politics, where information is polarized or selectively framed. Mainstream RAG benchmarks evaluate models under clean retrieval settings, where systems generate answers from gold-standard documents, or under synthetically perturbed settings, where documents are artificially injected with noise. These assumptions fail to reflect real-world conditions, often leading to an overestimation of RAG system performance. To address this gap, we introduce RAGuard, the first benchmark to evaluate the robustness of RAG systems against misleading retrievals. Unlike prior benchmarks that rely on synthetic noise, our fact-checking dataset captures naturally occurring misinformation by constructing its retrieval corpus from Reddit discussions. It categorizes retrieved evidence into three types: supporting, misleading, and unrelated, providing a realistic and challenging testbed for assessing how well RAG systems navigate different types of evidence. Our experiments reveal that, when exposed to potentially misleading retrievals, all tested LLM-powered RAG systems perform worse than their zero-shot baselines (i.e., no retrieval at all), while human annotators consistently perform better, highlighting LLMs' susceptibility to noisy environments. To our knowledge, RAGuard is the first benchmark to systematically assess the robustness of the RAG against misleading evidence. We expect this benchmark to drive future research toward improving RAG systems beyond idealized datasets, making them more reliable for real-world applications. The dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/UCSC-IRKM/RAGuard.</p></details> | <details><summary>Advan...</summary><p>Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

Current LLMs are trained on large code datasets and are capable of writing IEC 61131-3 compatible code out of the box, but they neither know specific function blocks, nor related project code. Moreover, companies like Mitsubishi Electric and their customers do not trust cloud providers. Hence, an own coding agent is the desired solution to cope with this. In this study, we present our work on a low-data domain coding assistant solution for industrial use. We show how we achieved high quality code generation without fine-tuning large models and by fine-tuning small local models for edge device usage. Our tool lets several AI models compete with each other, uses reasoning, corrects bugs automatically and checks code validity by compiling it directly in the chat interface. We support our approach with an extensive evaluation that comes with code compilation statistics and user ratings. We found that a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) supported coding assistant can work in low-data domains by using extensive prompt engineering and directed retrieval.</p></details> | ICIT2026 |

While existing work attributes hallucination to a simple over-reliance on parametric knowledge, we reframe this failure as an evolving, scale-dependent coordination failure between the Attention (reading) and Feed-Forward Network (recalling) pathways. We introduce FACTUM (Framework for Attesting Citation Trustworthiness via Underlying Mechanisms), a framework of four mechanistic scores: Contextual Alignment (CAS), Attention Sink Usage (BAS), Parametric Force (PFS), and Pathway Alignment (PAS). Our analysis reveals that correct citations are consistently marked by higher parametric force (PFS) and greater use of the attention sink (BAS) for information synthesis. Crucially, we find that "one-size-fits-all" theories are insufficient as the signature of correctness evolves with scale: while the 3B model relies on high pathway alignment (PAS), our best-performing 8B detector identifies a shift toward a specialized strategy where pathways provide distinct, orthogonal information. By capturing this complex interplay, FACTUM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 37.5% in AUC. Our results demonstrate that high parametric force is constructive when successfully coordinated with the Attention pathway, paving the way for more nuanced and reliable RAG systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECIR 2026. 13 pages, 2 figures</p></details> |

However, existing ranking models are primarily optimized for query--document relevance, which often misaligns with generators' preferences for evidence selection and citation, limiting their impact on response quality. Moreover, most approaches do not account for preference differences across generators, resulting in unstable cross-generator performance. We propose \textbf{Rank4Gen}, a generator-aware ranker for RAG that targets the goal of \emph{Ranking for Generators}. Rank4Gen introduces two key preference modeling strategies: (1) \textbf{From Ranking Relevance to Response Quality}, which optimizes ranking with respect to downstream response quality rather than query--document relevance; and (2) \textbf{Generator-Specific Preference Modeling}, which conditions a single ranker on different generators to capture their distinct ranking preferences. To enable such modeling, we construct \textbf{PRISM}, a dataset built from multiple open-source corpora and diverse downstream generators. Experiments on five challenging and recent RAG benchmarks demonstrate that RRank4Gen achieves strong and competitive performance for complex evidence composition in RAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[SD-RAG: A Prompt-Injection-Resilient Framework for Selective Disclosure in Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11199v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has attracted significant attention due to its ability to combine the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with knowledge obtained through efficient retrieval mechanisms over large-scale data collections. Currently, the majority of existing approaches overlook the risks associated with exposing sensitive or access-controlled information directly to the generation model. Only a few approaches propose techniques to instruct the generative model to refrain from disclosing sensitive information; however, recent studies have also demonstrated that LLMs remain vulnerable to prompt injection attacks that can override intended behavioral constraints. For these reasons, we propose a novel approach to Selective Disclosure in Retrieval-Augmented Generation, called SD-RAG, which decouples the enforcement of security and privacy constraints from the generation process itself. Rather than relying on prompt-level safeguards, SD-RAG applies sanitization and disclosure controls during the retrieval phase, prior to augmenting the language model's input. Moreover, we introduce a semantic mechanism to allow the ingestion of human-readable dynamic security and privacy constraints together with an optimized graph-based data model that supports fine-grained, policy-aware retrieval. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the superiority of SD-RAG over baseline existing approaches, achieving up to a $58\%$ improvement in the privacy score, while also showing a strong resilience to prompt injection attacks targeting the generative model.</p></details> |  |

While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is widely adopted to improve grounding, confidence calibration in RAG settings remains poorly understood. We conduct a systematic study across four benchmarks, revealing that LLMs exhibit poor calibration performance due to noisy retrieved contexts. Specifically, contradictory or irrelevant evidence tends to inflate the model's false certainty, leading to severe overconfidence. To address this, we propose NAACL Rules (Noise-AwAre Confidence CaLibration Rules) to provide a principled foundation for resolving overconfidence under noise. We further design NAACL, a noise-aware calibration framework that synthesizes supervision from about 2K HotpotQA examples guided by these rules. By performing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with this data, NAACL equips models with intrinsic noise awareness without relying on stronger teacher models. Empirical results show that NAACL yields substantial gains, improving ECE scores by 10.9% in-domain and 8.0% out-of-domain. By bridging the gap between retrieval noise and verbal calibration, NAACL paves the way for both accurate and epistemically reliable LLMs.</p></details> |  |

While scaling generators often improves accuracy, it also increases inference and deployment overhead. We study an orthogonal axis: enlarging the retriever's corpus, and how it trades off with generator scale. Across multiple open-domain QA benchmarks, corpus scaling consistently strengthens RAG and can in many cases match the gains of moving to a larger model tier, though with diminishing returns at larger scales. Small- and mid-sized generators paired with larger corpora often rival much larger models with smaller corpora; mid-sized models tend to gain the most, while tiny and very large models benefit less. Our analysis suggests that these improvements arise primarily from increased coverage of answer-bearing passages, while utilization efficiency remains largely unchanged. Overall, our results characterize a corpus-generator trade-off in RAG and provide empirical guidance on how corpus scale and model capacity interact in this setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceeding Version of ECIR 2026</p></details> |

They are not just text, nor just numbers; they are a complex amalgam of narrative and structure. Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have attempted to address this complexity with a blunt tool: linearization. We convert rich, multidimensional tables into simple Markdown-style text strings, hoping that an embedding model will capture the geometry of a spreadsheet in a single vector. But it has already been shown that this is mathematically insufficient. This work presents Topo-RAG, a framework that challenges the assumption that "everything is text". We propose a dual architecture that respects the topology of the data: we route fluid narrative through traditional dense retrievers, while tabular structures are processed by a Cell-Aware Late Interaction mechanism, preserving their spatial relationships. Evaluated on SEC-25, a synthetic enterprise corpus that mimics real-world complexity, Topo-RAG demonstrates an 18.4% improvement in nDCG@10 on hybrid queries compared to standard linearization approaches. It's not just about searching better; it's about understanding the shape of information.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disco-RAG: Discourse-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04377v3)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as an important means of enhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, most existing RAG strategies treat retrieved passages in a flat and unstructured way, which prevents the model from capturing structural cues and constrains its ability to synthesize knowledge from dispersed evidence across documents. To overcome these limitations, we propose Disco-RAG, a discourse-aware framework that explicitly injects discourse signals into the generation process. Our method constructs intra-chunk discourse trees to capture local hierarchies and builds inter-chunk rhetorical graphs to model cross-passage coherence. These structures are jointly integrated into a planning blueprint that conditions the generation. Experiments on question answering and long-document summarization benchmarks show the efficacy of our approach. Disco-RAG achieves state-of-the-art results on the benchmarks without fine-tuning. These findings underscore the important role of discourse structure in advancing RAG systems.</p></details> |  |

A 3DSG is constructed from multiple images of a scene, where objects are represented as nodes and relationships as edges. However, existing works for open-vocabulary 3DSG generation suffer from both low object-level recognition accuracy and speed, mainly due to constrained viewpoints, occlusions, and redundant surface density. To address these challenges, we propose RAG-3DSG to mitigate aggregation noise through re-shot guided uncertainty estimation and support object-level Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) via reliable low-uncertainty objects. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic downsample-mapping strategy to accelerate cross-image object aggregation with adaptive granularity. Experiments on Replica dataset demonstrate that RAG-3DSG significantly improves node captioning accuracy in 3DSG generation while reducing the mapping time by two-thirds compared to the vanilla version.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

We quantify this challenge using Dhao, an indigenous language of Eastern Indonesia with no digital footprint beyond the New Testament (NT). When applied to the unseen Old Testament (OT), a standard NMT model fine-tuned on the NT drops from an in-domain score of 36.17 chrF++ to 27.11 chrF++. To recover this loss, we introduce a hybrid framework where a fine-tuned NMT model generates an initial draft, which is then refined by a Large Language Model (LLM) using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The final system achieves 35.21 chrF++ (+8.10 recovery), effectively matching the original in-domain quality. Our analysis reveals that this performance is driven primarily by the number of retrieved examples rather than the choice of retrieval algorithm. Qualitative analysis confirms the LLM acts as a robust "safety net," repairing severe failures in zero-shot domains.</p></details> |  |

However, multimodal retrieval-augmented diagnosis is highly challenging. We explore a lightweight mechanism for enhancing diagnostic performance of retrieval-augmented LVLMs. We train a lightweight LVLM-aware multimodal retriever, such that the retriever learns to return images and texts that guide the LVLM toward correct predictions. In our low-resource setting, we perform only lightweight fine-tuning with small amounts of data, and use only general-purpose backbone models, achieving competitive results in clinical classification and VQA tasks compared to medically pre-trained models with extensive training. In a novel analysis, we highlight a previously unexplored class of errors that we term inconsistent retrieval predictions: cases where different top-retrieved images yield different predictions for the same target. We find that these cases are challenging for all models, even for non-retrieval models, and that our retrieval optimization mechanism significantly improves these cases over standard RAG. However, our analysis also sheds light on gaps in the ability of LVLMs to utilize retrieved information for clinical predictions.

These manuals, written in natural language, describe many steps in detail. Unfortunately, the number, magnitude, and articulation of these descriptions can significantly slow down and complicate the retrieval of the correct procedure during critical incidents. Interestingly, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enables the development of tools based on conversational interfaces that can assist operators in their retrieval tasks, improving their capability to respond to incidents. This paper presents the results of a set of experiments that derive from the analysis of the troubleshooting procedures available in Fincantieri, a large international company developing complex naval cyber-physical systems. Results show that RAG can assist operators in reacting promptly to failure symptoms, although specific measures have to be taken into consideration to cross-validate recommendations before actuating them.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in the Software Engineering in Practice track at the 48th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2026)</p></details> |

Despite advancements in NLP, poetry remains underexplored due to its complex figurative language and cultural specificity. We constructed a multi-label dataset of 7,662 entries (7,007 line-level and 615 work-level), annotated with 44 fine-grained emotion categories from five influential Korean poets. The KPoEM emotion classification model, fine-tuned through a sequential strategy -- moving from general-purpose corpora to the specialized KPoEM dataset -- achieved an F1-micro score of 0.60, significantly outperforming previous models (0.43). The model demonstrates an enhanced ability to identify temporally and culturally specific emotional expressions while preserving core poetic sentiments. Furthermore, applying the structured emotion dataset to a RAG-based poetry generation model demonstrates the empirical feasibility of generating texts that reflect the emotional and cultural sensibilities of Korean literature. This integrated approach strengthens the connection between computational techniques and literary analysis, opening new pathways for quantitative emotion research and generative poetics. Overall, this study provides a foundation for advancing emotion-centered analysis and creation in modern Korean poetry.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 22 tables, 3 figures, Digital Humanities and Social Sciences Korea Conference, James Joo-Jin Kim Center for Korean Studies, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA</p></details> |

This paper benchmarks three retrieval pipelines on Java codebases (Shopizer, with additional runs on ThingsBoard and OpenMRS Core): (A) vector-only No-Graph RAG, (B) an LLM-generated knowledge graph RAG (LLM-KB), and (C) a deterministic AST-derived knowledge graph RAG (DKB) built with Tree-sitter and bidirectional traversal. Using 15 architecture and code-tracing queries per repository, we measure indexing time, query latency, corpus coverage, cost, and answer correctness. DKB builds its graph in seconds, while LLM-KB requires much longer graph generation. LLM-KB also shows indexing incompleteness: on Shopizer, 377 files are skipped or missed, reducing embedded chunk coverage and graph size compared to DKB. End-to-end cost is modest for DKB relative to the vector-only baseline but much higher for LLM-KB, especially as repository scale increases. Query latency is similar for No-Graph and DKB, while LLM-KB is slower and more variable. On the Shopizer question suite, DKB achieves the highest correctness, LLM-KB is close behind, and the vector-only baseline performs worst on upstream architectural queries and has the highest hallucination risk. Overall, deterministic AST-derived graphs provide more reliable coverage and multi-hop grounding than LLM-extracted graphs at substantially lower indexing cost.</p></details> | 46 pages, 2 figures |

However, the development of robust agents is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality training data that reflects the noise and complexity of real-world retrieval environments. Conventional manual annotation is unscalable and often fails to capture the dynamic reasoning strategies required to handle retrieval failures. To bridge this gap, we introduce RAGShaper, a novel data synthesis framework designed to automate the construction of RAG tasks and robust agent trajectories. RAGShaper incorporates an InfoCurator to build dense information trees enriched with adversarial distractors spanning Perception and Cognition levels. Furthermore, we propose a constrained navigation strategy that forces a teacher agent to confront these distractors, thereby eliciting trajectories that explicitly demonstrate error correction and noise rejection. Comprehensive experiments confirm that models trained on our synthesized corpus significantly outperform existing baselines, exhibiting superior robustness in noise-intensive and complex retrieval tasks.</p></details> |  |

While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrated with Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a solution, these methods are fundamentally constrained by a single-query mode, leading to prohibitive latency and inherent brittleness. To overcome these limitations, we introduce RAG-R1, a novel two-stage training framework centered around multi-query parallelism. Our framework enables LLMs to adaptively leverage internal and external knowledge during the reasoning process while transitioning from the single-query mode to multi-query parallelism. This architectural shift bolsters reasoning robustness while significantly reducing inference latency. Extensive experiments on seven question-answering benchmarks confirm the superiority of our method, which outperforms the strongest baseline by up to 13.7% and decreases inference time by 11.1%.</p></details> |  |

| **[Is Agentic RAG worth it? An experimental comparison of RAG approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07711v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are usually defined by the combination of a generator and a retrieval component that extracts textual context from a knowledge base to answer user queries. However, such basic implementations exhibit several limitations, including noisy or suboptimal retrieval, misuse of retrieval for out-of-scope queries, weak query-document matching, and variability or cost associated with the generator. These shortcomings have motivated the development of "Enhanced" RAG, where dedicated modules are introduced to address specific weaknesses in the workflow. More recently, the growing self-reflective capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a new paradigm, which we refer to as "Agentic" RAG. In this approach, the LLM orchestrates the entire process-deciding which actions to perform, when to perform them, and whether to iterate-thereby reducing reliance on fixed, manually engineered modules. Despite the rapid adoption of both paradigms, it remains unclear which approach is preferable under which conditions. In this work, we conduct an extensive, empirically driven evaluation of Enhanced and Agentic RAG across multiple scenarios and dimensions. Our results provide practical insights into the trade-offs between the two paradigms, offering guidance on selecting the most effective RAG design for real-world applications, considering both costs and performance.</p></details> |  |

Yet standard MCQ/MRC-style evaluations do not capture key real-world failure modes, notably free-form hallucinations and whether models appropriately abstain when evidence is lacking. To shed a light on this aspect we introduce ISLAMICFAITHQA, a 3,810-item bilingual (Arabic/English) generative benchmark with atomic single-gold answers, which enables direct measurement of hallucination and abstention. We additionally developed an end-to-end grounded Islamic modelling suite consisting of (i) 25K Arabic text-grounded SFT reasoning pairs, (ii) 5K bilingual preference samples for reward-guided alignment, and (iii) a verse-level Qur'an retrieval corpus of $\sim$6k atomic verses (ayat). Building on these resources, we develop an agentic Quran-grounding framework (agentic RAG) that uses structured tool calls for iterative evidence seeking and answer revision. Experiments across Arabic-centric and multilingual LLMs show that retrieval improves correctness and that agentic RAG yields the largest gains beyond standard RAG, achieving state-of-the-art performance and stronger Arabic-English robustness even with a small model (i.e., Qwen3 4B). We will make the experimental resources and datasets publicly available for the community.</p></details> |  |
| **[FROAV: A Framework for RAG Observation and Agent Verification -- Lowering the Barrier to LLM Agent Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07504v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their integration into autonomous agent systems has created unprecedented opportunities for document analysis, decision support, and knowledge retrieval. However, the complexity of developing, evaluating, and iterating on LLM-based agent workflows presents significant barriers to researchers, particularly those without extensive software engineering expertise. We present FROAV (Framework for RAG Observation and Agent Verification), an open-source research platform that democratizes LLM agent research by providing a plug-and-play architecture combining visual workflow orchestration, a comprehensive evaluation framework, and extensible Python integration. FROAV implements a multi-stage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline coupled with a rigorous "LLM-as-a-Judge" evaluation system, all accessible through intuitive graphical interfaces. Our framework integrates n8n for no-code workflow design, PostgreSQL for granular data management, FastAPI for flexible backend logic, and Streamlit for human-in-the-loop interaction. Through this integrated ecosystem, researchers can rapidly prototype RAG strategies, conduct prompt engineering experiments, validate agent performance against human judgments, and collect structured feedback-all without writing infrastructure code. We demonstrate the framework's utility through its application to financial document analysis, while emphasizing its material-agnostic architecture that adapts to any domain requiring semantic analysis. FROAV represents a significant step toward making LLM agent research accessible to a broader scientific community, enabling researchers to focus on hypothesis testing and algorithmic innovation rather than system integration challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Credible Plan-Driven RAG Method for Multi-Hop Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16787v3)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated strong performance in single-hop question answering (QA) by integrating external knowledge into large language models (LLMs). However, its effectiveness remains limited in multi-hop QA, which demands both stable reasoning and factual consistency. Existing approaches often provide partial solutions, addressing either reasoning trajectory stability or factual verification, but rarely achieving both simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we propose PAR-RAG, a three-stage Plan-then-Act-and-Review framework inspired by the PDCA cycle. PAR-RAG incorporates semantic complexity as a unifying principle through three key components: (i) complexity-aware exemplar selection guides plan generation by aligning decomposition granularity with question difficulty, thereby stabilizing reasoning trajectories; (ii) execution follows a structured retrieve-then-read process; and (iii) dual verification identifies and corrects intermediate errors while dynamically adjusting verification strength based on question complexity: emphasizing accuracy for simple queries and multi-evidence consistency for complex ones. This cognitively inspired framework integrates theoretical grounding with practical robustness. Experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that PAR-RAG consistently outperforms competitive baselines, while ablation studies confirm the complementary roles of complexity-aware planning and dual verification. Collectively, these results establish PAR-RAG as a robust and generalizable framework for reliable multi-hop reasoning.</p></details> | 24 pages, 7 figures |

Benchmarking and Empirical Insights into Reasoning under Incomplete Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08344v4)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) is an increasingly explored approach for combining the reasoning capabilities of large language models with the structured evidence of knowledge graphs. However, current evaluation practices fall short: existing benchmarks often include questions that can be directly answered using existing triples in KG, making it unclear whether models perform reasoning or simply retrieve answers directly. Moreover, inconsistent evaluation metrics and lenient answer matching criteria further obscure meaningful comparisons. In this work, we introduce a general method for constructing benchmarks and present BRINK (Benchmark for Reasoning under Incomplete Knowledge) to systematically assess KG-RAG methods under knowledge incompleteness. Our empirical results show that current KG-RAG methods have limited reasoning ability under missing knowledge, often rely on internal memorization, and exhibit varying degrees of generalization depending on their design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a main conference paper at EACL 2026</p></details> |

This paper proposes a Tree-RAG acceleration method based on the improved Cuckoo Filter, which optimizes entity localization during the retrieval process to achieve significant performance improvements. Tree-RAG effectively organizes entities through the introduction of a hierarchical tree structure, while the Cuckoo Filter serves as an efficient data structure that supports rapid membership queries and dynamic updates. The experiment results demonstrate that our method is much faster than naive Tree-RAG while maintaining high levels of generative quality. When the number of trees is large, our method is hundreds of times faster than naive Tree-RAG.

While prior work has explored different mechanisms for providing knowledge to LLMs, such as finetuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), their relative effectiveness for multi-hop question answering remains insufficiently understood, particularly when the required knowledge is temporally novel. In this paper, we systematically compare parametric and non-parametric knowledge injection methods for open-domain multi-hop question answering. We evaluate unsupervised fine-tuning (continual pretraining), supervised fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation across three 7B-parameter open-source LLMs. Experiments are conducted on two benchmarks: QASC, a standard multi-hop science question answering dataset, and a newly constructed dataset of over 10,000 multi-hop questions derived from Wikipedia events in 2024, designed to test knowledge beyond the models' pretraining cutoff. Our results show that unsupervised fine-tuning provides only limited gains over base models, suggesting that continual pretraining alone is insufficient for improving multi-hop reasoning accuracy. In contrast, retrieval-augmented generation yields substantial and consistent improvements, particularly when answering questions that rely on temporally novel information. Supervised fine-tuning achieves the highest overall accuracy across models and datasets. These findings highlight fundamental differences in how knowledge injection mechanisms support multi-hop question answering and underscore the importance of retrieval-based methods when external or compositional knowledge is required.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Effectiveness of Proposed Techniques to Reduce Energy Consumption in RAG Systems: A Controlled Experiment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02522v2)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rising energy demands of machine learning (ML), e.g., implemented in popular variants like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, have raised significant concerns about their environmental sustainability. While previous research has proposed green tactics for ML-enabled systems, their empirical evaluation within RAG systems remains largely unexplored. This study presents a controlled experiment investigating five practical techniques aimed at reducing energy consumption in RAG systems. Using a production-like RAG system developed at our collaboration partner, the Software Improvement Group, we evaluated the impact of these techniques on energy consumption, latency, and accuracy. Through a total of 9 configurations spanning over 200 hours of trials using the CRAG dataset, we reveal that techniques such as increasing similarity retrieval thresholds, reducing embedding sizes, applying vector indexing, and using a BM25S reranker can significantly reduce energy usage, up to 60% in some cases. However, several techniques also led to unacceptable accuracy decreases, e.g., by up to 30% for the indexing strategies. Notably, finding an optimal retrieval threshold and reducing embedding size substantially reduced energy consumption and latency with no loss in accuracy, making these two techniques truly energy-efficient. We present the first comprehensive, empirical study on energy-efficient design techniques for RAG systems, providing guidance for developers and researchers aiming to build sustainable RAG applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 2026 International Conference on Software Engineering: Software Engineering in Society (ICSE-SEIS'26)</p></details> |
| **[TreePS-RAG: Tree-based Process Supervision for Reinforcement Learning in Agentic RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06922v1)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) formulates question answering as a multi-step interaction between reasoning and information retrieval, and has recently been advanced by reinforcement learning (RL) with outcome-based supervision. While effective, relying solely on sparse final rewards limits step-wise credit assignment and provides weak guidance for intermediate reasoning and actions. Recent efforts explore process-level supervision, but typically depend on offline constructed training data, which risks distribution shift, or require costly intermediate annotations. We present TreePS-RAG, an online, tree-based RL framework for agentic RAG that enables step-wise credit assignment while retaining standard outcome-only rewards. Our key insight is to model agentic RAG reasoning as a rollout tree, where each reasoning step naturally maps to a node. This tree structure allows step utility to be estimated via Monte Carlo estimation over its descendant outcomes, yielding fine-grained process advantages without requiring intermediate labels. To make this paradigm practical, we introduce an efficient online tree construction strategy that preserves exploration diversity under a constrained computational budget. With a rollout cost comparable to strong baselines like Search-R1, experiments on seven multi-hop and general QA benchmarks across multiple model scales show that TreePS-RAG consistently and significantly outperforms both outcome-supervised and leading process-supervised RL methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[CSR-RAG: An Efficient Retrieval System for Text-to-SQL on the Enterprise Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06564v1)** | 2026-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural language to SQL translation (Text-to-SQL) is one of the long-standing problems that has recently benefited from advances in Large Language Models (LLMs). While most academic Text-to-SQL benchmarks request schema description as a part of natural language input, enterprise-scale applications often require table retrieval before SQL query generation. To address this need, we propose a novel hybrid Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system consisting of contextual, structural, and relational retrieval (CSR-RAG) to achieve computationally efficient yet sufficiently accurate retrieval for enterprise-scale databases. Through extensive enterprise benchmarks, we demonstrate that CSR-RAG achieves up to 40% precision and over 80% recall while incurring a negligible average query generation latency of only 30ms on commodity data center hardware, which makes it appropriate for modern LLM-based enterprise-scale systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[L-RAG: Balancing Context and Retrieval with Entropy-Based Lazy Loading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06551v1)** | 2026-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the predominant paradigm for grounding Large Language Model outputs in factual knowledge, effectively mitigating hallucinations. However, conventional RAG systems operate under a "retrieve-always" assumption, querying vector databases for every input regardless of query complexity. This static approach incurs substantial computational overhead and inference latency, particularly problematic for high-throughput production deployments. We introduce L-RAG (Lazy Retrieval-Augmented Generation), an adaptive framework that implements hierarchical context management through entropy-based gating. L-RAG employs a two-tier architecture: queries are first processed with a compact document summary, and expensive chunk retrieval is triggered only when the model's predictive entropy exceeds a calibrated threshold, signaling genuine uncertainty. Through experiments on SQuAD 2.0 (N=500) using the Phi-2 model, we demonstrate that L-RAG provides a tunable accuracy-efficiency trade-off: at a conservative threshold (tau=0.5), L-RAG achieves 78.2% accuracy, matching Standard RAG (77.8%), with 8% retrieval reduction; at a balanced threshold (tau=1.0), retrieval reduction increases to 26% with modest accuracy trade-off (76.0%). Latency analysis shows that L-RAG saves 80-210ms per query when retrieval latency exceeds 500ms. Analysis of entropy distributions reveals statistically significant separation (p < 0.001) between correct predictions (H=1.72) and errors (H=2.20), validating entropy as a reliable uncertainty signal. L-RAG offers a practical, training-free approach toward more efficient RAG deployment, providing system architects with a configurable knob to balance accuracy and throughput requirements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Controlled Retrieval-augmented Context Evaluation for Long-form RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20051v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models by incorporating context retrieved from external knowledge sources. While the effectiveness of the retrieval module is typically evaluated with relevance-based ranking metrics, such metrics may be insufficient to reflect the retrieval's impact on the final RAG result, especially in long-form generation scenarios. We argue that providing a comprehensive retrieval-augmented context is important for long-form RAG tasks like report generation and propose metrics for assessing the context independent of generation. We introduce CRUX, a \textbf{C}ontrolled \textbf{R}etrieval-a\textbf{U}gmented conte\textbf{X}t evaluation framework designed to directly assess retrieval-augmented contexts. This framework uses human-written summaries to control the information scope of knowledge, enabling us to measure how well the context covers information essential for long-form generation. CRUX uses question-based evaluation to assess RAG's retrieval in a fine-grained manner. Empirical results show that CRUX offers more reflective and diagnostic evaluation. Our findings also reveal substantial room for improvement in current retrieval methods, pointing to promising directions for advancing RAG's retrieval. Our data and code are publicly available to support and advance future research on retrieval.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stable-RAG: Mitigating Retrieval-Permutation-Induced Hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02993v3)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a key paradigm for reducing factual hallucinations in large language models (LLMs), yet little is known about how the order of retrieved documents affects model behavior. We empirically show that under Top-5 retrieval with the gold document included, LLM answers vary substantially across permutations of the retrieved set, even when the gold document is fixed in the first position. This reveals a previously underexplored sensitivity to retrieval permutations. Although robust RAG methods primarily focus on enhancing LLM robustness to low-quality retrieval and mitigating positional bias to distribute attention fairly over long contexts, neither approach directly addresses permutation sensitivity. In this paper, we propose Stable-RAG, which exploits permutation sensitivity estimation to mitigate permutation-induced hallucinations. Stable-RAG runs the generator under multiple retrieval orders, clusters hidden states, and decodes from a cluster-center representation that captures the dominant reasoning pattern. It then uses these reasoning results to align hallucinated outputs toward the correct answer, encouraging the model to produce consistent and accurate predictions across document permutations. Experiments on three QA datasets show that Stable-RAG significantly improves answer accuracy, reasoning consistency and robust generalization across datasets, retrievers, and input lengths compared with baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 13 figures, 8 tables, under review</p></details> |

Traditional documentation is often outdated or incomplete, making it difficult to derive accurate, context-specific explanations. Meanwhile, issue-tracking systems capture rich and continuously updated development knowledge, but their potential for explainability remains untapped. With this work, we are the first to apply a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach for generating explanations from issue-tracking data. Our proof-of-concept system is implemented using open-source tools and language models, demonstrating the feasibility of leveraging structured issue data for explanation generation. Evaluating our approach on an exemplary project's set of GitHub issues, we achieve 90% alignment with human-written explanations. Additionally, our system exhibits strong faithfulness and instruction adherence, ensuring reliable and grounded explanations. These findings suggest that RAG-based methods can extend explainability beyond black-box ML models to a broader range of software systems, provided that issue-tracking data is available - making system behavior more accessible and interpretable.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NLBSE 2026, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil</p></details> |

This has motivated context compression, ranging from token pruning and summarization to embedding-based compression. While researchers have tried ''compressing'' these documents into smaller summaries or mathematical embeddings, there is a catch: the more you compress the data, the more the LLM struggles to understand it. To address this challenge, we propose ArcAligner (Adaptive recursive context *Aligner*), a lightweight module integrated into the language model layers to help the model better utilize highly compressed context representations for downstream generation. It uses an adaptive ''gating'' system that only adds extra processing power when the information is complex, keeping the system fast. Across knowledge-intensive QA benchmarks, ArcAligner consistently beats compression baselines at comparable compression rates, especially on multi-hop and long-tail settings.

Conversely, initial strategies that interleave retrieval with reasoning often lack global corpus awareness, while Knowledge Graph (KG)-based RAG performs strongly on complex multi-hop tasks but suffers on fact-oriented single-hop queries. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel RAG framework: ToPG (Traversal over Proposition Graphs). ToPG models its knowledge base as a heterogeneous graph of propositions, entities, and passages, effectively combining the granular fact density of propositions with graph connectivity. We leverage this structure using iterative Suggestion-Selection cycles, where the Suggestion phase enables a query-aware traversal of the graph, and the Selection phase provides LLM feedback to prune irrelevant propositions and seed the next iteration. Evaluated on three distinct QA tasks (Simple, Complex, and Abstract QA), ToPG demonstrates strong performance across both accuracy- and quality-based metrics. Overall, ToPG shows that query-aware graph traversal combined with factual granularity is a critical component for efficient structured RAG systems. ToPG is available at https://github.com/idiap/ToPG.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 10 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

In most environments, information is distributed across isolated files like reports and logs that lack explicit links. Standard search engines process files independently, ignoring the connections between them. Furthermore, manually building Knowledge Graphs is impractical for such vast data. To bridge this gap, we present Orion-RAG. Our core insight is simple yet effective: we do not need heavy algorithms to organize this data. Instead, we use a low-complexity strategy to extract lightweight paths that naturally link related concepts. We demonstrate that this streamlined approach suffices to transform fragmented documents into semi-structured data, enabling the system to link information across different files effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Orion-RAG consistently outperforms mainstream frameworks across diverse domains, supporting real-time updates and explicit Human-in-the-Loop verification with high cost-efficiency. Experiments on FinanceBench demonstrate superior precision with a 25.2% relative improvement over strong baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[TPA: Next Token Probability Attribution for Detecting Hallucinations in RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07515v3)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation remains a challenge. Prior approaches attribute hallucinations to a binary conflict between internal knowledge stored in FFNs and the retrieved context. However, this perspective is incomplete, failing to account for the impact of other components of the LLM, such as the user query, previously generated tokens, the self token, and the final LayerNorm adjustment. To comprehensively capture the impact of these components on hallucination detection, we propose TPA which mathematically attributes each token's probability to seven distinct sources: Query, RAG Context, Past Token, Self Token, FFN, Final LayerNorm, and Initial Embedding. This attribution quantifies how each source contributes to the generation of the next token. Specifically, we aggregate these attribution scores by Part-of-Speech (POS) tags to quantify the contribution of each model component to the generation of specific linguistic categories within a response. By leveraging these patterns, such as detecting anomalies where Nouns rely heavily on LayerNorm, TPA effectively identifies hallucinated responses. Extensive experiments show that TPA achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | Under review |

Analyzing LLMs in RAG-based Question-Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06189v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is the prevailing paradigm for grounding Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the mechanisms governing how models integrate groups of conflicting retrieved evidence remain opaque. Does an LLM answer a certain way because the evidence is factually strong, because of a prior belief, or merely because it is repeated frequently? To answer this, we introduce GroupQA, a curated dataset of 1,635 controversial questions paired with 15,058 diversely-sourced evidence documents, annotated for stance and qualitative strength. Through controlled experiments, we characterize group-level evidence aggregation dynamics: Paraphrasing an argument can be more persuasive than providing distinct independent support; Models favor evidence presented first rather than last, and Larger models are increasingly resistant to adapt to presented evidence. Additionally, we find that LLM explanations to group-based answers are unfaithful. Together, we show that LLMs behave consistently as vulnerable heuristic followers, with direct implications for improving RAG system design.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, ACL ARR submission</p></details> |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a promising solution, but current methods remain inefficient and often fail to maintain high answer quality. To address these challenges, we propose VideoSpeculateRAG, an efficient VLM-based RAG framework built on two key ideas. First, we introduce a speculative decoding pipeline: a lightweight draft model quickly generates multiple answer candidates, which are then verified and refined by a more accurate heavyweight model, substantially reducing inference latency without sacrificing correctness. Second, we identify a major source of error - incorrect entity recognition in retrieved knowledge - and mitigate it with a simple yet effective similarity-based filtering strategy that improves entity alignment and boosts overall answer accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that VideoSpeculateRAG achieves comparable or higher accuracy than standard RAG approaches while accelerating inference by approximately 2x. Our framework highlights the potential of combining speculative decoding with retrieval-augmented reasoning to enhance efficiency and reliability in complex, knowledge-intensive multimodal tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging OLAP and RAG: A Multidimensional Approach to the Design of Corpus Partitioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03748v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are increasingly deployed on large-scale document collections, often comprising millions of documents and tens of millions of text chunks. In industrial-scale retrieval platforms, scalability is typically addressed through horizontal sharding and a combination of Approximate Nearest-Neighbor search, hybrid indexing, and optimized metadata filtering. Although effective from an efficiency perspective, these mechanisms rely on bottom-up, similarity-driven organization and lack a conceptual rationale for corpus partitioning. In this paper, we claim that the design of large-scale RAG systems may benefit from the combination of two orthogonal strategies: semantic clustering, which optimizes locality in embedding space, and multidimensional partitioning, which governs where retrieval should occur based on conceptual dimensions such as time and organizational context. Although such dimensions are already implicitly present in current systems, they are used in an ad hoc and poorly structured manner. We propose the Dimensional Fact Model (DFM) as a conceptual framework to guide the design of multidimensional partitions for RAG corpora. The DFM provides a principled way to reason about facts, dimensions, hierarchies, and granularity in retrieval-oriented settings. This framework naturally supports hierarchical routing and controlled fallback strategies, ensuring that retrieval remains robust even in the presence of incomplete metadata, while transforming the search process from a 'black-box' similarity matching into a governable and deterministic workflow. This work is intended as a position paper; its goal is to bridge the gap between OLAP-style multidimensional modeling and modern RAG architectures, and to stimulate further research on principled, explainable, and governable retrieval strategies at scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Routing RAG: Binding Selective Retrieval with Knowledge Verbalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01018v3)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Selective retrieval aims to make retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) more efficient and reliable by skipping retrieval when an LLM's parametric knowledge suffices. Despite promising results, existing methods are constrained by a binary design choice: either retrieve from a single external source or skip retrieval and let the LLM directly produce the final answer. We argue that this fallback underestimates the model's knowledge and obscures the more general multi-source decision problem that arises in practical systems. We propose Self-Routing RAG (SR-RAG), which casts selective retrieval as knowledge source selection and treats the LLM itself as a first-class knowledge source. SR-RAG learns to select an appropriate knowledge source, optionally verbalize parametric knowledge, and answer using the selected source, all within a single left-to-right generation pass. SR-RAG further augments source selection by combining LLM-based uncertainty with a flexible external policy datastore to improve decision calibration. Across four benchmarks and three 7B-class LLMs, SR-RAG outperforms a strong selective retrieval baseline by 8.5%/2.1%/4.7% while performing 26%/40%/21% fewer retrievals, and it achieves favorable accuracy-latency trade-offs without dataset-specific threshold tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tackling the Inherent Difficulty of Noise Filtering in RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01896v2)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a widely adopted approach to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge and reducing hallucinations. However, noisy or irrelevant documents are often introduced during RAG, potentially degrading performance and even causing hallucinated outputs. While various methods have been proposed to filter out such noise, we argue that identifying irrelevant information from retrieved content is inherently difficult and limited number of transformer layers can hardly solve this. Consequently, retrievers fail to filter out irrelevant documents entirely. Therefore, LLMs must be robust against such noise, but we demonstrate that standard fine-tuning approaches are often ineffective in enabling the model to selectively utilize relevant information while ignoring irrelevant content due to the structural constraints of attention patterns. To address this, we propose a novel fine-tuning method designed to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant information within retrieved documents. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our approach significantly improves the robustness and performance of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

This study presents an LLM-powered, agentic assessment system built on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to address these challenges. The system integrates a large language model with a structured retrieval mechanism that accesses rubric criteria, exemplar essays, and instructor feedback to generate contextually grounded grades and formative comments. A mixed-methods evaluation was conducted using 701 student essays, combining quantitative analyses of inter-rater reliability, scoring alignment, and consistency with instructor assessments, alongside qualitative evaluation of feedback quality, pedagogical relevance, and student support. Results demonstrate that the RAG system can produce reliable, rubric-aligned feedback at scale, achieving 94--99% agreement with human evaluators, while also enhancing students' opportunities for self-regulated learning and engagement with assessment criteria. The discussion highlights both pedagogical limitations, including potential constraints on originality and feedback dialogue, and the transformative potential of RAG systems to augment instructors' capabilities, streamline assessment workflows, and support scalable, adaptive learning environments. This research contributes empirical evidence for the application of agentic AI in higher education, offering a scalable and pedagogically informed model for enhancing feedback accessibility, consistency, and quality.</p></details> | 19 Pages |

We propose SRAS (Sparse Reward-Aware Selector), a lightweight document selector trained via reinforcement learning (RL) for edge-native RAG deployment. Unlike prior RL-based retrievers that assume large memory and latency budgets, SRAS learns a compact (~0.76MB) policy using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), guided by a hybrid reward signal combining Relaxed F1 and BERTScore. Our method operates under tight token and compute constraints, maintaining <1s latency on CPU. SRAS outperforms supervised and random selectors on a synthetic QA benchmark, and generalizes to real-world data, achieving BERTScore F1 of 0.8546 on SQuAD v2 without domain-specific tuning. This work is the first to demonstrate that RL-based document selection can be made ultra-lightweight, latency-aware, and effective for on-device RAG pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at ICEdge 2025; nominated for Best Paper Award</p></details> |
| **[UNIDOC-BENCH: A Unified Benchmark for Document-Centric Multimodal RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03663v3)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal retrieval-augmented Generation (MM-RAG) is a key approach for applying large language models (LLMs) and agents to real-world knowledge bases, yet current evaluations are fragmented -- focusing on either text or images in isolation, or simplified multimodal setup, failing to capture document-centric multimodal use cases. In this paper, we introduce UniDoc-Bench, the first large-scale, realistic benchmark for MM-RAG built from $k$ real-world PDF pages across domains. Our pipeline extracts and links evidence from text, tables, and figures, then generates multimodal QA pairs spanning factual retrieval, comparison, summarization, and logical reasoning queries. To ensure reliability, all of QA pairs are validated by multiple human annotators and expert adjudication. UniDoc-Bench supports apples-to-apples comparison across four paradigms: 1) text-only, 2) image-only, 3) \emph{multimodal} text-image fusion and 4) multimodal joint retrieval -- under a unified protocol with standardized candidate pools, prompts, and evaluation metrics. UniDoc-Bench can also be used to evaluate Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. Our experiments show that multimodal text-image fusion RAG systems consistently outperform both unimodal and jointly multimodal embedding-based retrieval, indicating that neither text nor images alone are sufficient and that current multimodal embeddings remain inadequate. Beyond benchmarking, our analysis reveals when and how visual context complements textual evidence, uncovers systematic failure modes, and offers actionable guidance for developing more robust MM-RAG pipelines.</p></details> |  |

Simulating Vulnerabilities, and Threats in Multimodal Medical RAG System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17215v2)** | 2026-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) augmented with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) are increasingly employed in medical AI to enhance factual grounding through external clinical image-text retrieval. However, this reliance creates a significant attack surface. We propose MedThreatRAG, a novel multimodal poisoning framework that systematically probes vulnerabilities in medical RAG systems by injecting adversarial image-text pairs. A key innovation of our approach is the construction of a simulated semi-open attack environment, mimicking real-world medical systems that permit periodic knowledge base updates via user or pipeline contributions. Within this setting, we introduce and emphasize Cross-Modal Conflict Injection (CMCI), which embeds subtle semantic contradictions between medical images and their paired reports. These mismatches degrade retrieval and generation by disrupting cross-modal alignment while remaining sufficiently plausible to evade conventional filters. While basic textual and visual attacks are included for completeness, CMCI demonstrates the most severe degradation. Evaluations on IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR QA tasks show that MedThreatRAG reduces answer F1 scores by up to 27.66% and lowers LLaVA-Med-1.5 F1 rates to as low as 51.36%. Our findings expose fundamental security gaps in clinical RAG systems and highlight the urgent need for threat-aware design and robust multimodal consistency checks. Finally, we conclude with a concise set of guidelines to inform the safe development of future multimodal medical RAG systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sumbi...</summary><p>Sumbitted to 2026 ICASSP</p></details> |

While the former may be mitigated by RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) by anchoring answers in trusted clinical sources, there remains an open question as to whether the most effective model under this paradigm would be one that is fine-tuned on mental health data, or a more general and powerful model that succeeds purely on the basis of reasoning. In this paper, we perform a direct comparison by running four open-source models through the same RAG pipeline using ChromaDB: two generalist reasoners (Qwen2.5-3B and Phi-3-Mini) and two domain-specific fine-tunes (MentalHealthBot-7B and TherapyBot-7B). We use an LLM-as-a-Judge framework to automate evaluation over 50 turns. We find a clear trend: the generalist models outperform the domain-specific ones in empathy (3.72 vs. 3.26, $p < 0.001$) in spite of being much smaller (3B vs. 7B), and all models perform well in terms of safety, but the generalist models show better contextual understanding and are less prone to overfitting as we observe in the domain-specific models. Overall, our results indicate that for RAG-based therapy systems, strong reasoning is more important than training on mental health-specific vocabulary; i.e. a well-reasoned general model would provide more empathetic and balanced support than a larger narrowly fine-tuned model, so long as the answer is already grounded in clinical evidence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evidence-Grounded Multi-Agent Planning Support for Urban Carbon Governance via RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11587v1)** | 2026-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban carbon governance requires planners to integrate heterogeneous evidence -- emission inventories, statistical yearbooks, policy texts, technical measures, and academic findings -- into actionable, cross-departmental plans. Large Language Models (LLMs) can assist planning workflows, yet their factual reliability and evidential traceability remain critical barriers in professional use. This paper presents an evidence-grounded multi-agent planning support system for urban carbon governance built upon standard text-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) (without GraphRAG). We align the system with the typical planning workflow by decomposing tasks into four specialized agents: (i) evidence Q\&A for fact checking and compliance queries, (ii) emission status assessment for diagnostic analysis, (iii) planning recommendation for generating multi-sector governance pathways, and (iv) report integration for producing planning-style deliverables. We evaluate the system in two task families: factual retrieval and comprehensive planning generation. On factual retrieval tasks, introducing RAG increases the average score from below 6 to above 90, and dramatically improves key-field extraction (e.g., region and numeric values near 100\% detection). A real-city case study (Ningbo, China) demonstrates end-to-end report generation with strong relevance, coverage, and coherence in expert review, while also highlighting boundary inconsistencies across data sources as a practical limitation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Multi-step RAG with Hypergraph-based Memory for Long-Context Complex Relational Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23959v2)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-step retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a widely adopted strategy for enhancing large language models (LLMs) on tasks that demand global comprehension and intensive reasoning. Many RAG systems incorporate a working memory module to consolidate retrieved information. However, existing memory designs function primarily as passive storage that accumulates isolated facts for the purpose of condensing the lengthy inputs and generating new sub-queries through deduction. This static nature overlooks the crucial high-order correlations among primitive facts, the compositions of which can often provide stronger guidance for subsequent steps. Therefore, their representational strength and impact on multi-step reasoning and knowledge evolution are limited, resulting in fragmented reasoning and weak global sense-making capacity in extended contexts. We introduce HGMem, a hypergraph-based memory mechanism that extends the concept of memory beyond simple storage into a dynamic, expressive structure for complex reasoning and global understanding. In our approach, memory is represented as a hypergraph whose hyperedges correspond to distinct memory units, enabling the progressive formation of higher-order interactions within memory. This mechanism connects facts and thoughts around the focal problem, evolving into an integrated and situated knowledge structure that provides strong propositions for deeper reasoning in subsequent steps. We evaluate HGMem on several challenging datasets designed for global sense-making. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses show that our method consistently improves multi-step RAG and substantially outperforms strong baseline systems across diverse tasks.</p></details> | 21 pages |

Current biomedical question-answering systems primarily focus on short-form answers, failing to provide comprehensive explanations necessary for clinical decision-making. We present RAG-BioQA, a retrieval-augmented generation framework for long-form biomedical question answering. Our system integrates BioBERT embeddings with FAISS indexing for retrieval and a LoRA fine-tuned FLAN-T5 model for answer generation. We train on 181k QA pairs from PubMedQA, MedDialog, and MedQuAD, and evaluate on a held-out PubMedQA test set. We compare four retrieval strategies: dense retrieval (FAISS), BM25, ColBERT, and MonoT5. Our results show that domain-adapted dense retrieval outperforms zero-shot neural re-rankers, with the best configuration achieving 0.24 BLEU-1 and 0.29 ROUGE-1. Fine-tuning improves BERTScore by 81\% over the base model. We release our framework to support reproducible biomedical QA research.</p></details> | Submitted to ICAEI |

This paper presents a comparative study on the effectiveness of LLM-based techniques for detecting software vulnerabilities. The study evaluates three approaches, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and a Dual-Agent LLM framework, against a baseline LLM model. A curated dataset was compiled from Big-Vul and real-world code repositories from GitHub, focusing on five critical Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories: CWE-119, CWE-399, CWE-264, CWE-20, and CWE-200. Our RAG approach, which integrated external domain knowledge from the internet and the MITRE CWE database, achieved the highest overall accuracy (0.86) and F1 score (0.85), highlighting the value of contextual augmentation. Our SFT approach, implemented using parameter-efficient QLoRA adapters, also demonstrated strong performance. Our Dual-Agent system, an architecture in which a secondary agent audits and refines the output of the first, showed promise in improving reasoning transparency and error mitigation, with reduced resource overhead. These results emphasize that incorporating a domain expertise mechanism significantly strengthens the practical applicability of LLMs in real-world vulnerability detection tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Retrieval for RAG via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24652v2)** | 2026-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) becomes more widespread, the role of retrieval is shifting from retrieving information for human browsing to retrieving context for AI reasoning. This shift creates more complex search environments, where relevance is difficult to pre-define. Existing retrievers rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with human labels or synthetic data, resulting in static relevance that struggles to adapt to diverse RAG environments. To address this challenge, we propose R3, a Retrieval framework optimized for RAG through Reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we adopt an RL training paradigm that enables the retriever to explore and self-improve within given RAG environments, automating the learning process with minimal manual experimentation or tuning effort. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate that R3 improves RAG performance by 5.2% over the original retriever and surpasses state-of-the-art retrievers by 4.9%, while achieving comparable results to LLM-augmented retrieval and RAG systems built on post-trained or instruction-tuned LLMs. It is both efficient and practical, requiring only 4 GPUs and completing training within a single day.</p></details> |  |

We present AdaGReS, a redundancy-aware context selection framework for token-budgeted RAG that optimizes a set-level objective combining query-chunk relevance and intra-set redundancy penalties. AdaGReS performs greedy selection under a token-budget constraint using marginal gains derived from the objective, and introduces a closed-form, instance-adaptive calibration of the relevance-redundancy trade-off parameter to eliminate manual tuning and adapt to candidate-pool statistics and budget limits. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that the proposed objective exhibits epsilon-approximate submodularity under practical embedding similarity conditions, yielding near-optimality guarantees for greedy selection. Experiments on open-domain question answering (Natural Questions) and a high-redundancy biomedical (drug) corpus demonstrate consistent improvements in redundancy control and context quality, translating to better end-to-end answer quality and robustness across settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Mitigation is achieved in a question-answering Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework while detection is obtained by introducing the Negative Missing Information Scoring System (NMISS), which accounts for contextual relevance in responses. While RAG mitigates hallucinations by grounding answers in external data, NMISS refines the evaluation by identifying cases where traditional metrics incorrectly flag contextually accurate responses as hallucinations. I use Italian health news articles as context to evaluate LLM performance. Results show that Gemma2 and GPT-4 outperform the other models, with GPT-4 producing answers closely aligned with reference responses. Mid-tier models, such as Llama2, Llama3, and Mistral benefit significantly from NMISS, highlighting their ability to provide richer contextual information. This combined approach offers new insights into the reduction and more accurate assessment of hallucinations in LLMs, with applications in real-world healthcare tasks and other domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Domain Knowledge for Financial QA: A Multi-Retriever RAG Approach with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23848v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This research project addresses the errors of financial numerical reasoning Question Answering (QA) tasks due to the lack of domain knowledge in finance. Despite recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), financial numerical questions remain challenging because they require specific domain knowledge in finance and complex multi-step numeric reasoning. We implement a multi-retriever Retrieval Augmented Generators (RAG) system to retrieve both external domain knowledge and internal question contexts, and utilize the latest LLM to tackle these tasks. Through comprehensive ablation experiments and error analysis, we find that domain-specific training with the SecBERT encoder significantly contributes to our best neural symbolic model surpassing the FinQA paper's top model, which serves as our baseline. This suggests the potential superior performance of domain-specific training. Furthermore, our best prompt-based LLM generator achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with significant improvement (>7%), yet it is still below the human expert performance. This study highlights the trade-off between hallucinations loss and external knowledge gains in smaller models and few-shot examples. For larger models, the gains from external facts typically outweigh the hallucination loss. Finally, our findings confirm the enhanced numerical reasoning capabilities of the latest LLM, optimized for few-shot learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[TV-RAG: A Temporal-aware and Semantic Entropy-Weighted Framework for Long Video Retrieval and Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23483v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Video Language Models (LVLMs) have rapidly emerged as the focus of multimedia AI research. Nonetheless, when confronted with lengthy videos, these models struggle: their temporal windows are narrow, and they fail to notice fine-grained semantic shifts that unfold over extended durations. Moreover, mainstream text-based retrieval pipelines, which rely chiefly on surface-level lexical overlap, ignore the rich temporal interdependence among visual, audio, and subtitle channels. To mitigate these limitations, we propose TV-RAG, a training-free architecture that couples temporal alignment with entropy-guided semantics to improve long-video reasoning. The framework contributes two main mechanisms: \emph{(i)} a time-decay retrieval module that injects explicit temporal offsets into the similarity computation, thereby ranking text queries according to their true multimedia context; and \emph{(ii)} an entropy-weighted key-frame sampler that selects evenly spaced, information-dense frames, reducing redundancy while preserving representativeness. By weaving these temporal and semantic signals together, TV-RAG realises a dual-level reasoning routine that can be grafted onto any LVLM without re-training or fine-tuning. The resulting system offers a lightweight, budget-friendly upgrade path and consistently surpasses most leading baselines across established long-video benchmarks such as Video-MME, MLVU, and LongVideoBench, confirming the effectiveness of our model. The code can be found at https://github.com/AI-Researcher-Team/TV-RAG.</p></details> |  |

We present HiFi-RAG (Hierarchical Filtering RAG), the winning closed-source system in the Text-to-Text static evaluation of the MMU-RAGent NeurIPS 2025 Competition. Our approach moves beyond standard embedding-based retrieval via a multi-stage pipeline. We leverage the speed and cost-efficiency of Gemini 2.5 Flash (4-6x cheaper than Pro) for query formulation, hierarchical content filtering, and citation attribution, while reserving the reasoning capabilities of Gemini 2.5 Pro for final answer generation. On the MMU-RAGent validation set, our system outperformed the baseline, improving ROUGE-L to 0.274 (+19.6%) and DeBERTaScore to 0.677 (+6.2%).

We propose FVA-RAG (Falsification-Verification Alignment RAG), a pipeline that inverts the standard RAG workflow by treating the initial response as a draft hypothesis and explicitly retrieving anti-context to stress-test it. We evaluate on the full TruthfulQA-Generation benchmark (N=817) under a fully frozen protocol with 0 live web calls and identical retrieval budgets across methods. Using gpt-4o for generation and deterministic judging, FVA-RAG achieves 79.80-80.05% accuracy across two independently built frozen corpora , significantly outperforming prompted variants of Self-RAG (71.11-72.22%) and CRAG (71.36-73.93%) with p < 10^-6 according to McNemar's test. FVA-RAG triggers falsification on 24.5-29.3% of queries, demonstrating that targeted counter-evidence retrieval is decisive for mitigating premise-confirming hallucinations.</p></details> |  |

Existing works in financial sentiment analysis have not considered the impact of stock prices or market feedback on sentiment analysis. In this paper, we propose an adaptive framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with real-world stock market feedback to improve sentiment classification in the context of the Indian stock market. The proposed methodology fine-tunes the LLaMA 3.2 3B model using instruction-based learning on the SentiFin dataset. To enhance sentiment predictions, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline is employed that dynamically selects multi-source contextual information based on the cosine similarity of the sentence embeddings. Furthermore, a feedback-driven module is introduced that adjusts the reliability of the source by comparing predicted sentiment with actual next-day stock returns, allowing the system to iteratively adapt to market behavior. To generalize this adaptive mechanism across temporal data, a reinforcement learning agent trained using proximal policy optimization (PPO) is incorporated. The PPO agent learns to optimize source weighting policies based on cumulative reward signals from sentiment-return alignment. Experimental results on NIFTY 50 news headlines collected from 2024 to 2025 demonstrate that the proposed system significantly improves classification accuracy, F1-score, and market alignment over baseline models and static retrieval methods. The results validate the potential of combining instruction-tuned LLMs with dynamic feedback and reinforcement learning for robust, market-aware financial sentiment modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CODS 2025</p></details> |

Despite their recent success, multimodal RAG in the audio-visual domain remains challenging due to 1) limited modality coverage and multi-hop connectivity of existing MMKGs, and 2) retrieval based solely on similarity in a shared multimodal embedding space, which fails to filter out off-topic or redundant knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose M$^3$KG-RAG, a Multi-hop Multimodal Knowledge Graph-enhanced RAG that retrieves query-aligned audio-visual knowledge from MMKGs, improving reasoning depth and answer faithfulness in MLLMs. Specifically, we devise a lightweight multi-agent pipeline to construct multi-hop MMKG (M$^3$KG), which contains context-enriched triplets of multimodal entities, enabling modality-wise retrieval based on input queries. Furthermore, we introduce GRASP (Grounded Retrieval And Selective Pruning), which ensures precise entity grounding to the query, evaluates answer-supporting relevance, and prunes redundant context to retain only knowledge essential for response generation. Extensive experiments across diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that M$^3$KG-RAG significantly enhances MLLMs' multimodal reasoning and grounding over existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

This study investigates the design and application of an AI chatbot as an educational tool in higher education. Designed to operate in the Greek language, the chatbot addresses linguistic challenges unique to Greek while delivering accurate, context grounded support aligned with the curriculum. The AI chatbot is built on the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework by grounding its responses in specific course content. RAG architecture significantly enhances the chatbots reliability by providing accurate, context-aware responses while mitigating common challenges associated with large language models (LLMs), such as hallucinations and misinformation. The AI chatbot serves a dual purpose: it enables students to access accurate, ondemand academic support and assists educators in the rapid creation of relevant educational materials. This dual functionality promotes learner autonomy and streamlines the instructional design process. The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness, reliability, and perceived usability of RAG based chatbots in higher education, exploring their potential to enhance educational practices and outcomes as well as supporting the broader adoption of AI technologies in language specific educational contexts. Findings from this research are expected to contribute to the emerging field of AI driven education by demonstrating how intelligent systems can be effectively aligned with pedagogical goals.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, 6th Barcelona Conference on Education (BCE2025)</p></details> |

However, existing methods rely on model-internal signals (e.g., logits, entropy), which are fundamentally unreliable because LLMs are typically ill-calibrated and often exhibit high confidence in erroneous outputs. We propose QuCo-RAG, which shifts from subjective confidence to objective statistics computed from pre-training data. Our method quantifies uncertainty through two stages: (1) before generation, we identify low-frequency entities indicating long-tail knowledge gaps; (2) during generation, we verify entity co-occurrence in the pre-training corpus, where zero co-occurrence often signals hallucination risk. Both stages leverage Infini-gram for millisecond-latency queries over 4 trillion tokens, triggering retrieval when uncertainty is high. Experiments on multi-hop QA benchmarks show QuCo-RAG achieves EM gains of 5--12 points over state-of-the-art baselines with OLMo-2 models, and transfers effectively to models with undisclosed pre-training data (Llama, Qwen, GPT), improving EM by up to 14 points. Domain generalization on biomedical QA further validates the robustness of our paradigm. These results establish corpus-grounded verification as a principled, practically model-agnostic paradigm for dynamic RAG.

To leverage this data, large language models (LLMs) have been introduced, offering stronger semantic understanding and reasoning than traditional deep learning, thereby enhancing the explainability of detection results. Despite the growing prominence of LLMs in this field, there is a scarcity of scholarly works that systematically synthesize how advanced enhancement techniques, specifically Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Agentic systems, can be utilized to address these reliability and reasoning limitations. Here, we systematically survey the evolving landscape of LLM-based methods for social media mental disorder analysis, spanning standard pre-trained language models, RAG to mitigate hallucinations and contextual gaps, and agentic systems for autonomous reasoning and multi-step intervention. We organize existing work by technical paradigm and clinical target, extending beyond common internalizing disorders to include psychotic disorders and externalizing behaviors. Additionally, the paper comprehensively evaluates the performance of LLMs, including the impact of RAG, across various tasks.

| **[Replace, Don't Expand: Mitigating Context Dilution in Multi-Hop RAG via Fixed-Budget Evidence Assembly](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10787v2)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often fail on multi-hop queries when the initial retrieval misses a bridge fact. Prior corrective approaches, such as Self-RAG, CRAG, and Adaptive-$k$, typically address this by \textit{adding} more context or pruning existing lists. However, simply expanding the context window often leads to \textbf{context dilution}, where distractors crowd out relevant information. We propose \textbf{SEAL-RAG}, a training-free controller that adopts a \textbf{``replace, don't expand''} strategy to fight context dilution under a fixed retrieval depth $k$. SEAL executes a (\textbf{S}earch $\rightarrow$ \textbf{E}xtract $\rightarrow$ \textbf{A}ssess $\rightarrow$ \textbf{L}oop) cycle: it performs on-the-fly, entity-anchored extraction to build a live \textit{gap specification} (missing entities/relations), triggers targeted micro-queries, and uses \textit{entity-first ranking} to actively swap out distractors for gap-closing evidence. We evaluate SEAL-RAG against faithful re-implementations of Basic RAG, CRAG, Self-RAG, and Adaptive-$k$ in a shared environment on \textbf{HotpotQA} and \textbf{2WikiMultiHopQA}. On HotpotQA ($k=3$), SEAL improves answer correctness by \textbf{+3--13 pp} and evidence precision by \textbf{+12--18 pp} over Self-RAG. On 2WikiMultiHopQA ($k=5$), it outperforms Adaptive-$k$ by \textbf{+8.0 pp} in accuracy and maintains \textbf{96\%} evidence precision compared to 22\% for CRAG. These gains are statistically significant ($p<0.001$). By enforcing fixed-$k$ replacement, SEAL yields a predictable cost profile while ensuring the top-$k$ slots are optimized for precision rather than mere breadth. We release our code and data at https://github.com/mosherino/SEAL-RAG.</p></details> | 24 pages, 2 figures |
| **[The Semantic Illusion: Certified Limits of Embedding-Based Hallucination Detection in RAG Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15068v2)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems remain susceptible to hallucinations despite grounding in retrieved evidence. While current detection methods leverage embedding similarity and natural language inference (NLI), their reliability in safety-critical settings remains unproven. We apply conformal prediction to RAG hallucination detection, transforming heuristic scores into decision sets with finite-sample coverage guarantees (1-alpha). Using calibration sets of n=600, we demonstrate a fundamental dichotomy: on synthetic hallucinations (Natural Questions), embedding methods achieve 95% coverage with 0% False Positive Rate (FPR). However, on real hallucinations from RLHF-aligned models (HaluEval), the same methods fail catastrophically, yielding 100% FPR at target coverage. We analyze this failure through the lens of distributional tails, showing that while NLI models achieve acceptable AUC (0.81), the "hardest" hallucinations are semantically indistinguishable from faithful responses, forcing conformal thresholds to reject nearly all valid outputs. Crucially, GPT-4 as a judge achieves 7% FPR (95% CI:[3.4%, 13.7%]) on the same data, proving the task is solvable via reasoning but opaque to surface-level semantics--a phenomenon we term the "Semantic Illusion."</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[How to Discover Knowledge for FutureG: Contextual RAG and LLM Prompting for O-RAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02382v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a retrieval-augmented question answering framework for 5G/6G networks, where the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) has become central to disaggregated, virtualized, and AI-driven wireless systems. While O-RAN enables multi-vendor interoperability and cloud-native deployments, its fast-changing specifications and interfaces pose major challenges for researchers and practitioners. Manual navigation of these complex documents is labor-intensive and error-prone, slowing system design, integration, and deployment. To address this challenge, we adopt Contextual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Contextual RAG), a strategy in which candidate answer choices guide document retrieval and chunk-specific context to improve large language model (LLM) performance. This improvement over traditional RAG achieves more targeted and context-aware retrieval, which improves the relevance of documents passed to the LLM, particularly when the query alone lacks sufficient context for accurate grounding. Our framework is designed for dynamic domains where data evolves rapidly and models must be continuously updated or redeployed, all without requiring LLM fine-tuning. We evaluate this framework using the ORANBenchmark-13K dataset, and compare three LLMs, namely, Llama3.2, Qwen2.5-7B, and Qwen3.0-4B, across both Direct Question Answering (Direct Q&A) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategies. We show that Contextual RAG consistently improves accuracy over standard RAG and base prompting, while maintaining competitive runtime and CO2 emissions. These results highlight the potential of Contextual RAG to serve as a scalable and effective solution for domain-specific Q&A in ORAN and broader 5G/6G environments, enabling more accurate interpretation of evolving standards while preserving efficiency and sustainability.</p></details> |  |

Drawing on psychological insights, we propose LUFY, a simple yet effective method that focuses on emotionally arousing memories and retains less than 10% of the conversation. In the user experiment, participants interacted with three types of RAG chatbots, each for 2 hours over 4 sessions, marking the most extensive assessment of a chatbot's long-term capabilities to date -- more than four times longer than any existing benchmark. The results demonstrate that prioritizing arousing memories while forgetting the majority of the conversation significantly enhances user experience. This study pushes the frontier of long-term conversations and highlights the importance of forgetting unimportant parts of conversations.

| **[Leveraging Spreading Activation for Improved Document Retrieval in Knowledge-Graph-Based RAG Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15922v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite initial successes and a variety of architectures, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems still struggle to reliably retrieve and connect the multi-step evidence required for complicated reasoning tasks. Most of the standard RAG frameworks regard all retrieved information as equally reliable, overlooking the varying credibility and interconnected nature of large textual corpora. GraphRAG approaches offer potential improvement to RAG systems by integrating knowledge graphs, which structure information into nodes and edges, capture entity relationships, and enable multi-step logical traversal. However, GraphRAG is not always an ideal solution as it depends on high-quality graph representations of the corpus, which requires either pre-existing knowledge graphs that are expensive to build and update, or automated graph construction pipelines that are often unreliable. Moreover, systems following this paradigm typically use large language models to guide graph traversal and evidence retrieval, leading to challenges similar to those encountered with standard RAG. In this paper, we propose a novel RAG framework that employs the spreading activation algorithm to retrieve information from a corpus of documents interconnected by automatically constructed knowledge graphs, thereby enhancing the performance of large language models on complex tasks such as multi-hop question answering. Experiments show that our method achieves better or comparable performance to iterative RAG methodologies, while also being easily integrable as a plug-and-play module with a wide range of RAG-based approaches. Combining our method with chain-of-thought iterative retrieval yields up to a 39\% absolute gain in answer correctness compared to naive RAG, achieving these results with small open-weight language models and highlighting its effectiveness in resource-constrained settings.</p></details> | 20 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Ragged Blocks: Rendering Structured Text with Style](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06460v3)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whether it be source code in a programming language, prose in natural language, or otherwise, text is highly structured. Currently, text visualizations are confined either to _flat, line-based_ decorations, which can convey only limited information about textual structure, or _nested boxes_, which convey structure but often destroy the typographic layout of the underlying text. We hypothesize that the lack of rich styling options limits the kinds of information that are displayed alongside text, wherever it may be displayed. In this paper, we show that it is possible to achieve arbitrarily nested decorations while minimally disturbing the underlying typographic layout. Specifically, we present a layout algorithm that generates _ragged blocks_, or _rocks_, which are rectilinear polygons that allow nested text to be compactly rendered even when styled with borders and padding. Our layout algorithm is evaluated on a benchmark suite comprising representative source code files in multiple programming languages. The (ragged block) layouts produced by our algorithm are substantially more compact than the (rectangular block) layouts produced by conventional techniques, when uniformly styling every element in the syntax tree with borders and padding.</p></details> | <details><summary>UIST ...</summary><p>UIST 2025 Paper + Appendices</p></details> |

This survey examines how Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are being used to make VRD retrieval practical for RAG. We organize the literature into three roles: Modality-Unifying Captioners, Multimodal Embedders, and End-to-End Representers. We compare these roles along retrieval granularity, information fidelity, latency and index size, and compatibility with reranking and grounding. We also outline key trade-offs and offer some practical guidance on when to favor each role. Finally, we identify promising directions for future research, including adaptive retrieval units, model size reduction, and the development of evaluation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages; accepted at AACL-IJCNLP 2025 (main conference)</p></details> |
| **[Cog-RAG: Cognitive-Inspired Dual-Hypergraph with Theme Alignment Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13201v2)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the response quality and domain-specific performance of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge to combat hallucinations. In recent research, graph structures have been integrated into RAG to enhance the capture of semantic relations between entities. However, it primarily focuses on low-order pairwise entity relations, limiting the high-order associations among multiple entities. Hypergraph-enhanced approaches address this limitation by modeling multi-entity interactions via hyperedges, but they are typically constrained to inter-chunk entity-level representations, overlooking the global thematic organization and alignment across chunks. Drawing inspiration from the top-down cognitive process of human reasoning, we propose a theme-aligned dual-hypergraph RAG framework (Cog-RAG) that uses a theme hypergraph to capture inter-chunk thematic structure and an entity hypergraph to model high-order semantic relations. Furthermore, we design a cognitive-inspired two-stage retrieval strategy that first activates query-relevant thematic content from the theme hypergraph, and then guides fine-grained recall and diffusion in the entity hypergraph, achieving semantic alignment and consistent generation from global themes to local details. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Cog-RAG significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art baseline approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026 main conference</p></details> |
| **[Mixture-of-RAG: Integrating Text and Tables with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09554v3)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) achieve optimal utility when their responses are grounded in external knowledge sources. However, real-world documents, such as annual reports, scientific papers, and clinical guidelines, frequently combine extensive narrative content with complex, hierarchically structured tables. While existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems effectively integrate LLMs' generative capabilities with external retrieval-based information, their performance significantly deteriorates especially processing such heterogeneous text-table hierarchies. To address this limitation, we formalize the task of Heterogeneous Document RAG, which requires joint retrieval and reasoning across textual and hierarchical tabular data. We propose MixRAG, a novel three-stage framework: (i) hierarchy row-and-column-level (H-RCL) representation that preserves hierarchical structure and heterogeneous relationship, (ii) an ensemble retriever with LLM-based reranking for evidence alignment, and (iii) multi-step reasoning decomposition via a RECAP prompt strategy. To bridge the gap in available data for this domain, we release the dataset DocRAGLib, a 2k-document corpus paired with automatically aligned text-table summaries and gold document annotations. The comprehensive experiment results demonstrate that MixRAG boosts top-1 retrieval by 46% over strong text-only, table-only, and naive-mixture baselines, establishing new state-of-the-art performance for mixed-modality document grounding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGKDD 2026</p></details> |
| **[Semantic Grounding Index: Geometric Bounds on Context Engagement in RAG Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13771v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems hallucinate, what geometric trace does this leave in embedding space? We introduce the Semantic Grounding Index (SGI), defined as the ratio of angular distances from the response to the question versus the context on the unit hypersphere $\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$.Our central finding is \emph{semantic laziness}: hallucinated responses remain angularly proximate to questions rather than departing toward retrieved contexts. On HaluEval ($n$=5,000), we observe large effect sizes (Cohen's $d$ ranging from 0.92 to 1.28) across five embedding models with mean cross-model correlation $r$=0.85. Crucially, we derive from the spherical triangle inequality that SGI's discriminative power should increase with question-context angular separation $θ(q,c)$-a theoretical prediction confirmed empirically: effect size rises monotonically from $d$=0.61 -low $θ(q,c)$, to $d$=1.27 -high $θ(q,c)$, with AUC improving from 0.72 to 0.83. Subgroup analysis reveals that SGI excels on long responses ($d$=2.05) and short questions ($d$=1.22), while remaining robust across context lengths. Calibration analysis yields ECE=0.10, indicating SGI scores can serve as probability estimates, not merely rankings. A critical negative result on TruthfulQA (AUC=0.478) establishes that angular geometry measures topical engagement rather than factual accuracy. SGI provides computationally efficient, theoretically grounded infrastructure for identifying responses that warrant verification in production RAG deployments.</p></details> |  |
| **[GRADE: Generating multi-hop QA and fine-gRAined Difficulty matrix for RAG Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16994v2)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are widely adopted in knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, but current evaluations often overlook the structural complexity and multi-step reasoning required in real-world scenarios. These benchmarks overlook key factors such as the interaction between retrieval difficulty and reasoning depth. To address this gap, we propose GRADE, a novel evaluation framework that models task difficulty along two orthogonal dimensions: (1) reasoning depth, defined by the number of inference steps (hops), and (2) semantic distance between the query and its supporting evidence. We construct a synthetic multi-hop QA dataset from factual news articles by extracting knowledge graphs and augmenting them through semantic clustering to recover missing links, allowing us to generate diverse and difficulty-controlled queries. Central to our framework is a 2D difficulty matrix that combines generator-side and retriever-side difficulty. Experiments across multiple domains and models show that error rates strongly correlate with our difficulty measures, validating their diagnostic utility. GRADE enables fine-grained analysis of RAG performance and provides a scalable foundation for evaluating and improving multi-hop reasoning in real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 findings</p></details> |
| **[Bounding Hallucinations: Information-Theoretic Guarantees for RAG Systems via Merlin-Arthur Protocols](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11614v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models rely on retrieved evidence to guide large language model (LLM) generators, yet current systems treat retrieval as a weak heuristic rather than verifiable evidence. As a result, LLMs answer without support, hallucinate under incomplete or misleading context, and rely on spurious evidence. We introduce a training framework that treats the entire RAG pipeline -- both the retriever and the generator -- as an interactive proof system via an adaptation of the Merlin-Arthur (M/A) protocol. Arthur (the generator LLM) trains on questions of unkown provenance: Merlin provides helpful evidence, while Morgana injects adversarial, misleading context. Both use a linear-time XAI method to identify and modify the evidence most influential to Arthur. Consequently, Arthur learns to (i) answer when the context support the answer, (ii) reject when evidence is insufficient, and (iii) rely on the specific context spans that truly ground the answer. We further introduce a rigorous evaluation framework to disentangle explanation fidelity from baseline predictive errors. This allows us to introduce and measure the Explained Information Fraction (EIF), which normalizes M/A certified mutual-information guarantees relative to model capacity and imperfect benchmarks. Across three RAG datasets and two model families of varying sizes, M/A-trained LLMs show improved groundedness, completeness, soundness, and reject behavior, as well as reduced hallucinations -- without needing manually annotated unanswerable questions. The retriever likewise improves recall and MRR through automatically generated M/A hard positives and negatives. Our results demonstrate that autonomous interactive-proof-style supervision provides a principled and practical path toward reliable RAG systems that treat retrieved documents not as suggestions, but as verifiable evidence.</p></details> | 34 pages, 19 figures |
