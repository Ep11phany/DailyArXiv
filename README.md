| **[A Survey of Reinforcement Learning for Large Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08827v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we survey recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for reasoning with Large Language Models (LLMs). RL has achieved remarkable success in advancing the frontier of LLM capabilities, particularly in addressing complex logical tasks such as mathematics and coding. As a result, RL has emerged as a foundational methodology for transforming LLMs into LRMs. With the rapid progress of the field, further scaling of RL for LRMs now faces foundational challenges not only in computational resources but also in algorithm design, training data, and infrastructure. To this end, it is timely to revisit the development of this domain, reassess its trajectory, and explore strategies to enhance the scalability of RL toward Artificial SuperIntelligence (ASI). In particular, we examine research applying RL to LLMs and LRMs for reasoning abilities, especially since the release of DeepSeek-R1, including foundational components, core problems, training resources, and downstream applications, to identify future opportunities and directions for this rapidly evolving area. We hope this review will promote future research on RL for broader reasoning models. Github: https://github.com/TsinghuaC3I/Awesome-RL-for-LRMs</p></details> |  |
| **[TweakLLM: A Routing Architecture for Dynamic Tailoring of Cached Responses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23674v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) process millions of queries daily, making efficient response caching a compelling optimization for reducing cost and latency. However, preserving relevance to user queries using this approach proves difficult due to the personalized nature of chatbot interactions and the limited accuracy of semantic similarity search. To address this, we present TweakLLM, a novel routing architecture that employs a lightweight LLM to dynamically adapt cached responses to incoming prompts. Through comprehensive evaluation, including user studies with side-by-side comparisons, satisfaction voting, as well as multi-agent LLM debates, we demonstrate that TweakLLM maintains response quality comparable to frontier models while significantly improving cache effectiveness. Our results across real-world datasets highlight TweakLLM as a scalable, resource-efficient caching solution for high-volume LLM deployments without compromising user experience.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Large Language Model Hacking: Quantifying the Hidden Risks of Using LLMs for Text Annotation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08825v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming social science research by enabling the automation of labor-intensive tasks like data annotation and text analysis. However, LLM outputs vary significantly depending on the implementation choices made by researchers (e.g., model selection, prompting strategy, or temperature settings). Such variation can introduce systematic biases and random errors, which propagate to downstream analyses and cause Type I, Type II, Type S, or Type M errors. We call this LLM hacking. We quantify the risk of LLM hacking by replicating 37 data annotation tasks from 21 published social science research studies with 18 different models. Analyzing 13 million LLM labels, we test 2,361 realistic hypotheses to measure how plausible researcher choices affect statistical conclusions. We find incorrect conclusions based on LLM-annotated data in approximately one in three hypotheses for state-of-the-art models, and in half the hypotheses for small language models. While our findings show that higher task performance and better general model capabilities reduce LLM hacking risk, even highly accurate models do not completely eliminate it. The risk of LLM hacking decreases as effect sizes increase, indicating the need for more rigorous verification of findings near significance thresholds. Our extensive analysis of LLM hacking mitigation techniques emphasizes the importance of human annotations in reducing false positive findings and improving model selection. Surprisingly, common regression estimator correction techniques are largely ineffective in reducing LLM hacking risk, as they heavily trade off Type I vs. Type II errors. Beyond accidental errors, we find that intentional LLM hacking is unacceptably simple. With few LLMs and just a handful of prompt paraphrases, anything can be presented as statistically significant.</p></details> |  |
| **[Building High-Quality Datasets for Portuguese LLMs: From Common Crawl Snapshots to Industrial-Grade Corpora](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08824v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of large language models (LLMs) is deeply influenced by the quality and composition of their training data. While much of the existing work has centered on English, there remains a gap in understanding how to construct effective training corpora for other languages. We explore scalable methods for building web-based corpora for LLMs. We apply them to build a new 120B token corpus in Portuguese that achieves competitive results to an industrial-grade corpus. Using a continual pretraining setup, we study how different data selection and preprocessing strategies affect LLM performance when transitioning a model originally trained in English to another language. Our findings demonstrate the value of language-specific filtering pipelines, including classifiers for education, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), as well as toxic content. We show that adapting a model to the target language leads to performance improvements, reinforcing the importance of high-quality, language-specific data. While our case study focuses on Portuguese, our methods are applicable to other languages, offering insights for multilingual LLM development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Subjective Behaviors and Preferences in LLM: Language of Browsing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15474v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A Large Language Model (LLM) offers versatility across domains and tasks, purportedly benefiting users with a wide variety of behaviors and preferences. We question this perception about an LLM when users have inherently subjective behaviors and preferences, as seen in their ubiquitous and idiosyncratic browsing of websites or apps. The sequential behavior logs of pages, thus generated, form something akin to each user's self-constructed "language", albeit without the structure and grammar imbued in natural languages. We ask: (i) Can a small LM represent the "language of browsing" better than a large LM? (ii) Can an LM with a single set of parameters (or, single LM) adequately capture myriad users' heterogeneous, subjective behaviors and preferences? (iii) Can a single LM with high average performance, yield low variance in performance to make alignment good at user level? We introduce clusterwise LM training, HeTLM (Heterogeneity aware Training of Language Model), appropriate for subjective behaviors. We find that (i) a small LM trained using a page-level tokenizer outperforms large pretrained or finetuned LMs; (ii) HeTLM with heterogeneous cluster specific set of parameters outperforms a single LM of the same family, controlling for the number of parameters; and (iii) a higher mean and a lower variance in generation ensues, implying improved alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating LLMs Without Oracle Feedback: Agentic Annotation Evaluation Through Unsupervised Consistency Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08809v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs), when paired with prompt-based tasks, have significantly reduced data annotation costs and reliance on human annotators. However, evaluating the quality of their annotations remains challenging in dynamic, unsupervised environments where oracle feedback is scarce and conventional methods fail. To address this challenge, we propose a novel agentic annotation paradigm, where a student model collaborates with a noisy teacher (the LLM) to assess and refine annotation quality without relying on oracle feedback. The student model, acting as an unsupervised feedback mechanism, employs a user preference-based majority voting strategy to evaluate the consistency of the LLM outputs. To systematically measure the reliability of LLM-generated annotations, we introduce the Consistent and Inconsistent (CAI) Ratio, a novel unsupervised evaluation metric. The CAI Ratio not only quantifies the annotation quality of the noisy teacher under limited user preferences but also plays a critical role in model selection, enabling the identification of robust LLMs in dynamic, unsupervised environments. Applied to ten open-domain NLP datasets across four LLMs, the CAI Ratio demonstrates a strong positive correlation with LLM accuracy, establishing it as an essential tool for unsupervised evaluation and model selection in real-world settings.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Scaling Truth: The Confidence Paradox in AI Fact-Checking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08803v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of misinformation underscores the need for scalable and reliable fact-checking solutions. Large language models (LLMs) hold promise in automating fact verification, yet their effectiveness across global contexts remains uncertain. We systematically evaluate nine established LLMs across multiple categories (open/closed-source, multiple sizes, diverse architectures, reasoning-based) using 5,000 claims previously assessed by 174 professional fact-checking organizations across 47 languages. Our methodology tests model generalizability on claims postdating training cutoffs and four prompting strategies mirroring both citizen and professional fact-checker interactions, with over 240,000 human annotations as ground truth. Findings reveal a concerning pattern resembling the Dunning-Kruger effect: smaller, accessible models show high confidence despite lower accuracy, while larger models demonstrate higher accuracy but lower confidence. This risks systemic bias in information verification, as resource-constrained organizations typically use smaller models. Performance gaps are most pronounced for non-English languages and claims originating from the Global South, threatening to widen existing information inequalities. These results establish a multilingual benchmark for future research and provide an evidence base for policy aimed at ensuring equitable access to trustworthy, AI-assisted fact-checking.</p></details> | <details><summary>65 pa...</summary><p>65 pages, 26 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Calibrating MLLM-as-a-judge via Multimodal Bayesian Prompt Ensembles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08777v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate text-to-image (TTI) generation systems, providing automated judgments based on visual and textual context. However, these "judge" models often suffer from biases, overconfidence, and inconsistent performance across diverse image domains. While prompt ensembling has shown promise for mitigating these issues in unimodal, text-only settings, our experiments reveal that standard ensembling methods fail to generalize effectively for TTI tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a new multimodal-aware method called Multimodal Mixture-of-Bayesian Prompt Ensembles (MMB). Our method uses a Bayesian prompt ensemble approach augmented by image clustering, allowing the judge to dynamically assign prompt weights based on the visual characteristics of each sample. We show that MMB improves accuracy in pairwise preference judgments and greatly enhances calibration, making it easier to gauge the judge's true uncertainty. In evaluations on two TTI benchmarks, HPSv2 and MJBench, MMB outperforms existing baselines in alignment with human annotations and calibration across varied image content. Our findings highlight the importance of multimodal-specific strategies for judge calibration and suggest a promising path forward for reliable large-scale TTI evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 8 figures, Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[MPO: Boosting LLM Agents with Meta Plan Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02682v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled LLM-based agents to successfully tackle interactive planning tasks. However, despite their successes, existing approaches often suffer from planning hallucinations and require retraining for each new agent. To address these challenges, we propose the Meta Plan Optimization (MPO) framework, , which enhances agent planning capabilities by directly incorporating explicit guidance. Unlike previous methods that rely on complex knowledge, which either require significant human effort or lack quality assurance, MPO leverages high-level general guidance through meta plans to assist agent planning and enables continuous optimization of the meta plans based on feedback from the agent's task execution. Our experiments conducted on two representative tasks demonstrate that MPO significantly outperforms existing baselines. Moreover, our analysis indicates that MPO provides a plug-and-play solution that enhances both task completion efficiency and generalization capabilities in previous unseen scenarios.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |
| **[Making REST APIs Agent-Ready: From OpenAPI to MCP Servers for Tool-Augmented LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16044v3)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving from passive text generators into active agents that invoke external tools. To support this shift, scalable protocols for tool integration are essential. The Model Context Protocol (MCP), introduced by Anthropic in 2024, offers a schema-driven standard for dynamic tool discovery and invocation. Yet, building MCP servers remains manual and repetitive, requiring developers to write glue code, handle authentication, and configure schemas by hand-replicating much of the integration effort MCP aims to eliminate. This paper investigates whether MCP server construction can be meaningfully automated. We begin by analyzing adoption trends: among 22,000+ MCP-tagged GitHub repositories created within six months of release, fewer than 5% include servers, typically small, single-maintainer projects dominated by repetitive scaffolding. To address this gap, we present AutoMCP, a compiler that generates MCP servers from OpenAPI 2.0/3.0 specifications. AutoMCP parses REST API definitions and produces complete server implementations, including schema registration and authentication handling. We evaluate AutoMCP on 50 real-world APIs spanning 5,066 endpoints across over 10 domains. From a stratified sample of 1,023 tool calls, 76.5% succeeded out of the box. Manual failure analysis revealed five recurring issues, all attributable to inconsistencies or omissions in the OpenAPI contracts. After minor fixes, averaging 19 lines of spec changes per API, AutoMCP achieved 99.9% success. Our findings (i) analyze MCP adoption and quantify the cost of manual server development, (ii) demonstrate that OpenAPI specifications, despite quality issues, enable near-complete MCP server automation, and (iii) contribute a corpus of 5,066 callable tools along with insights on repairing common specification flaws.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating Compositional Reasoning in Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06037v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large pre-trained time series foundation models (TSFMs) have demonstrated promising zero-shot performance across a wide range of domains. However, a question remains: Do TSFMs succeed by memorizing patterns in training data, or do they possess the ability to reason about such patterns? While reasoning is a topic of great interest in the study of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is undefined and largely unexplored in the context of TSFMs. In this work, inspired by language modeling literature, we formally define compositional reasoning in forecasting and distinguish it from in-distribution generalization. We evaluate the reasoning and generalization capabilities of 16 popular deep learning forecasting models on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets. Additionally, through controlled studies, we systematically examine which design choices in 7 popular open-source TSFMs contribute to improved reasoning capabilities. Our study yields key insights into the impact of TSFM architecture design on compositional reasoning and generalization. We find that patch-based Transformers have the best reasoning performance, closely followed by residualized MLP-based architectures, which are 97\% less computationally complex in terms of FLOPs and 86\% smaller in terms of the number of trainable parameters. Interestingly, in some zero-shot out-of-distribution scenarios, these models can outperform moving average and exponential smoothing statistical baselines trained on in-distribution data. Only a few design choices, such as the tokenization method, had a significant (negative) impact on Transformer model performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[BcQLM: Efficient Vision-Language Understanding with Distilled Q-Gated Cross-Modal Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08715v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) advance, their large-scale architectures pose challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. In the age of large models, where energy efficiency, computational scalability and environmental sustainability are paramount, the development of lightweight and high-performance models is critical for real-world applications. As such, we propose a lightweight MLLM framework for end-to-end visual question answering. Our proposed approach centres on BreezeCLIP, a compact yet powerful vision-language encoder optimised for efficient multimodal understanding. With only 1.2 billion parameters overall, our model significantly reduces computational cost while achieving performance comparable to standard-size MLLMs. Experiments conducted on multiple datasets further validate its effectiveness in balancing accuracy and efficiency. The modular and extensible design enables generalisation to broader multimodal tasks. The proposed lightweight vision-language framework is denoted as BcQLM (BreezeCLIP-enhanced Q-Gated Multimodal Language Model). It offers a promising path toward deployable MLLMs under practical hardware constraints. The source code is available at https://github.com/thico0224/BcQLM.</p></details> |  |
| **[REGen: A Reliable Evaluation Framework for Generative Event Argument Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16838v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event argument extraction identifies arguments for predefined event roles in text. Existing work evaluates this task with exact match (EM), where predicted arguments must align exactly with annotated spans. While suitable for span-based models, this approach falls short for large language models (LLMs), which often generate diverse yet semantically accurate arguments. EM severely underestimates performance by disregarding valid variations. Furthermore, EM evaluation fails to capture implicit arguments (unstated but inferable) and scattered arguments (distributed across a document). These limitations underscore the need for an evaluation framework that better captures models' actual performance. To bridge this gap, we introduce REGen, a Reliable Evaluation framework for Generative event argument extraction. REGen combines the strengths of exact, relaxed, and LLM-based matching to better align with human judgment. Experiments on six datasets show that REGen reveals an average performance gain of +23.93 F1 over EM, reflecting capabilities overlooked by prior evaluation. Human validation further confirms REGen's effectiveness, achieving 87.67% alignment with human assessments of argument correctness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP-2025</p></details> |
| **[Scaling LLM Planning: NL2FLOW for Parametric Problem Generation and Rigorous Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02253v4)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust workflow composition is critical for effective agent performance, yet progress in Large Language Model (LLM) planning and reasoning is hindered by a scarcity of scalable evaluation data. This work introduces NL2Flow, a fully automated pipeline for generating and evaluating workflow planning problems. NL2Flow generates problems parametrically in a structured intermediate representation, translating them into both natural language and formal PDDL. I evaluate several open-source, instruct-tuned LLMs on a dataset of 2296 low-difficulty problems generated by NL2Flow. Results demonstrate that the best-performing model achieved 86% success in generating valid plans and 69% in generating optimal plans (for solvable problems). Regression analysis shows that the influence of problem characteristics on plan generation is contingent on both model and prompt design. Importantly, translating natural language problems into a structured JSON representation prior to symbolic planning significantly improved success rates, suggesting a benefit from neuro-symbolic integration. These findings underscore the importance of understanding error sources within LLM reasoning as systems scale to more complex tasks. As LLM reasoning scales to increasingly complex problems, understanding the shifting bottlenecks and sources of error within these systems will be crucial.</p></details> | 31 pages, 7 figures |
| **[LED: LLM Enhanced Open-Vocabulary Object Detection without Human Curated Data Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13794v5)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large foundation models trained on large-scale vision-language data can boost Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVD) via synthetic training data, yet the hand-crafted pipelines often introduce bias and overfit to specific prompts. We sidestep this issue by directly fusing hidden states from Large Language Models (LLMs) into detectors-an avenue surprisingly under-explored. This paper presents a systematic method to enhance visual grounding by utilizing decoder layers of the LLM of an MLLM. We introduce a zero-initialized cross-attention adapter to enable efficient knowledge fusion from LLMs to object detectors, a new approach called LED (LLM Enhanced Open-Vocabulary Object Detection). We find that intermediate LLM layers already encode rich spatial semantics; adapting only the early layers yields most of the gain. With Swin-T as the vision encoder, Qwen2-0.5B + LED lifts GroundingDINO by 3.82 % on OmniLabel at just 8.7 % extra GFLOPs, and a larger vision backbone pushes the improvement to 6.22 %. Extensive ablations on adapter variants, LLM scales and fusion depths further corroborate our design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Architecting Resilient LLM Agents: A Guide to Secure Plan-then-Execute Implementations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08646v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Model (LLM) agents become increasingly capable of automating complex, multi-step tasks, the need for robust, secure, and predictable architectural patterns is paramount. This paper provides a comprehensive guide to the ``Plan-then-Execute'' (P-t-E) pattern, an agentic design that separates strategic planning from tactical execution. We explore the foundational principles of P-t-E, detailing its core components - the Planner and the Executor - and its architectural advantages in predictability, cost-efficiency, and reasoning quality over reactive patterns like ReAct (Reason + Act). A central focus is placed on the security implications of this design, particularly its inherent resilience to indirect prompt injection attacks by establishing control-flow integrity. We argue that while P-t-E provides a strong foundation, a defense-in-depth strategy is necessary, and we detail essential complementary controls such as the Principle of Least Privilege, task-scoped tool access, and sandboxed code execution. To make these principles actionable, this guide provides detailed implementation blueprints and working code references for three leading agentic frameworks: LangChain (via LangGraph), CrewAI, and AutoGen. Each framework's approach to implementing the P-t-E pattern is analyzed, highlighting unique features like LangGraph's stateful graphs for re-planning, CrewAI's declarative tool scoping for security, and AutoGen's built-in Docker sandboxing. Finally, we discuss advanced patterns, including dynamic re-planning loops, parallel execution with Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), and the critical role of Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) verification, to offer a complete strategic blueprint for architects, developers, and security engineers aiming to build production-grade, resilient, and trustworthy LLM agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models for Mobile GUI Text Input Generation: An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08948v3)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile applications have become an essential part of our daily lives, making ensuring their quality an important activity. Graphical User Interface (GUI) testing is a quality assurance method that has frequently been used for mobile apps. Some GUIs require these text inputs to be able to move from one page to the next. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated excellent text-generation capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, there has not yet been any empirical study to evaluate different pre-trained LLMs' effectiveness at generating text inputs for mobile GUI testing. This paper reports on a large-scale empirical study that extensively investigates the effectiveness of eight state-of-the-art LLMs in Android text-input generation for UI pages. We collected 115 Android apps from Google Play and extracted contextual information from the UI pages to construct prompts for LLMs. The experimental results show that some LLMs can generate more effective and higher-quality text inputs. We conducted an experiment to assess the bug-detection capabilities of LLMs by directly generating invalid text inputs. We also invited professional testers to manually evaluate, modify, and re-create the LLM-generated text inputs. We integrated the text-input generation process into DroidBot to augment its UI-exploration capabilities. Finally, we present several valuable insights regarding the application of LLMs to Android testing, particularly for the generation of text inputs: These insights will benefit the Android testing community.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdsQA: Towards Advertisement Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08621v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have taken a great step towards AGI. Meanwhile, an increasing number of domain-specific problems such as math and programming boost these general-purpose models to continuously evolve via learning deeper expertise. Now is thus the time further to extend the diversity of specialized applications for knowledgeable LLMs, though collecting high quality data with unexpected and informative tasks is challenging. In this paper, we propose to use advertisement (ad) videos as a challenging test-bed to probe the ability of LLMs in perceiving beyond the objective physical content of common visual domain. Our motivation is to take full advantage of the clue-rich and information-dense ad videos' traits, e.g., marketing logic, persuasive strategies, and audience engagement. Our contribution is three-fold: (1) To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use ad videos with well-designed tasks to evaluate LLMs. We contribute AdsQA, a challenging ad Video QA benchmark derived from 1,544 ad videos with 10,962 clips, totaling 22.7 hours, providing 5 challenging tasks. (2) We propose ReAd-R, a Deepseek-R1 styled RL model that reflects on questions, and generates answers via reward-driven optimization. (3) We benchmark 14 top-tier LLMs on AdsQA, and our \texttt{ReAd-R}~achieves the state-of-the-art outperforming strong competitors equipped with long-chain reasoning capabilities by a clear margin.</p></details> | ICCV-2025 |

To probe these abilities, we developed a new benchmark based on the game Baba Is You where an agent manipulates both objects in the environment and rules, represented by movable tiles with words written on them, to reach a specified goal and win the game. We test three state-of-the-art multi-modal large language models (OpenAI GPT-4o, Google Gemini-1.5-Pro and Gemini-1.5-Flash) and find that they fail dramatically when generalization requires that the rules of the game must be manipulated and combined.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Drivel-ology: Challenging LLMs with Interpreting Nonsense with Depth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03867v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Drivelology, a unique linguistic phenomenon characterised as "nonsense with depth" - utterances that are syntactically coherent yet pragmatically paradoxical, emotionally loaded, or rhetorically subversive. While such expressions may resemble surface-level nonsense, they encode implicit meaning requiring contextual inference, moral reasoning, or emotional interpretation. We find that current large language models (LLMs), despite excelling at many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, consistently fail to grasp the layered semantics of Drivelological text. To investigate this, we construct a benchmark dataset of over 1,200+ meticulously curated and diverse examples across English, Mandarin, Spanish, French, Japanese, and Korean. Each example underwent careful expert review to verify its Drivelological characteristics, involving multiple rounds of discussion and adjudication to address disagreements. Using this dataset, we evaluate a range of LLMs on classification, generation, and reasoning tasks. Our results reveal clear limitations of LLMs: models often confuse Drivelology with shallow nonsense, produce incoherent justifications, or miss implied rhetorical functions altogether. These findings highlight a deep representational gap in LLMs' pragmatic understanding and challenge the assumption that statistical fluency implies cognitive comprehension. We release our dataset and code to facilitate further research in modelling linguistic depth beyond surface-level coherence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for oral presentation at the EMNLP 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |
| **[Memorization in Large Language Models in Medicine: Prevalence, Characteristics, and Implications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08604v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in medicine. To date, LLMs have been widely applied to tasks such as diagnostic assistance, medical question answering, and clinical information synthesis. However, a key open question remains: to what extent do LLMs memorize medical training data. In this study, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of memorization of LLMs in medicine, assessing its prevalence (how frequently it occurs), characteristics (what is memorized), volume (how much content is memorized), and potential downstream impacts (how memorization may affect medical applications). We systematically analyze common adaptation scenarios: (1) continued pretraining on medical corpora, (2) fine-tuning on standard medical benchmarks, and (3) fine-tuning on real-world clinical data, including over 13,000 unique inpatient records from Yale New Haven Health System. The results demonstrate that memorization is prevalent across all adaptation scenarios and significantly higher than reported in the general domain. Memorization affects both the development and adoption of LLMs in medicine and can be categorized into three types: beneficial (e.g., accurate recall of clinical guidelines and biomedical references), uninformative (e.g., repeated disclaimers or templated medical document language), and harmful (e.g., regeneration of dataset-specific or sensitive clinical content). Based on these findings, we offer practical recommendations to facilitate beneficial memorization that enhances domain-specific reasoning and factual accuracy, minimize uninformative memorization to promote deeper learning beyond surface-level patterns, and mitigate harmful memorization to prevent the leakage of sensitive or identifiable patient information.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Ensemble for RAG: Role of Context Length in Zero-Shot Question Answering for BioASQ Challenge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08596v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biomedical question answering (QA) poses significant challenges due to the need for precise interpretation of specialized knowledge drawn from a vast, complex, and rapidly evolving corpus. In this work, we explore how large language models (LLMs) can be used for information retrieval (IR), and an ensemble of zero-shot models can accomplish state-of-the-art performance on a domain-specific Yes/No QA task. Evaluating our approach on the BioASQ challenge tasks, we show that ensembles can outperform individual LLMs and in some cases rival or surpass domain-tuned systems - all while preserving generalizability and avoiding the need for costly fine-tuning or labeled data. Our method aggregates outputs from multiple LLM variants, including models from Anthropic and Google, to synthesize more accurate and robust answers. Moreover, our investigation highlights a relationship between context length and performance: while expanded contexts are meant to provide valuable evidence, they simultaneously risk information dilution and model disorientation. These findings emphasize IR as a critical foundation in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches for biomedical QA systems. Precise, focused retrieval remains essential for ensuring LLMs operate within relevant information boundaries when generating answers from retrieved documents. Our results establish that ensemble-based zero-shot approaches, when paired with effective RAG pipelines, constitute a practical and scalable alternative to domain-tuned systems for biomedical question answering.</p></details> | CEUR-WS, CLEF2025 |
| **[Pay Attention to Real World Perturbations! Natural Robustness Evaluation in Machine Reading Comprehension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16523v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As neural language models achieve human-comparable performance on Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) and see widespread adoption, ensuring their robustness in real-world scenarios has become increasingly important. Current robustness evaluation research, though, primarily develops synthetic perturbation methods, leaving unclear how well they reflect real life scenarios. Considering this, we present a framework to automatically examine MRC models on naturally occurring textual perturbations, by replacing paragraph in MRC benchmarks with their counterparts based on available Wikipedia edit history. Such perturbation type is natural as its design does not stem from an arteficial generative process, inherently distinct from the previously investigated synthetic approaches. In a large-scale study encompassing SQUAD datasets and various model architectures we observe that natural perturbations result in performance degradation in pre-trained encoder language models. More worryingly, these state-of-the-art Flan-T5 and Large Language Models (LLMs) inherit these errors. Further experiments demonstrate that our findings generalise to natural perturbations found in other more challenging MRC benchmarks. In an effort to mitigate these errors, we show that it is possible to improve the robustness to natural perturbations by training on naturally or synthetically perturbed examples, though a noticeable gap still remains compared to performance on unperturbed data.</p></details> |  |

However, their scalability to Large Language Models (LLMs) is fundamentally constrained by their vast parameter sizes. Notably, LLaMA-7B - the smallest model in LLaMA series - demands more than 1,000 cm2 of silicon area even in advanced CMOS nodes. This paper presents BitROM, the first CiROM-based accelerator that overcomes this limitation through co-design with BitNet's 1.58-bit quantization model, enabling practical and efficient LLM inference at the edge. BitROM introduces three key innovations: 1) a novel Bidirectional ROM Array that stores two ternary weights per transistor; 2) a Tri-Mode Local Accumulator optimized for ternary-weight computations; and 3) an integrated Decode-Refresh (DR) eDRAM that supports on-die KV-cache management, significantly reducing external memory access during decoding. In addition, BitROM integrates LoRA-based adapters to enable efficient transfer learning across various downstream tasks. Evaluated in 65nm CMOS, BitROM achieves 20.8 TOPS/W and a bit density of 4,967 kB/mm2 - offering a 10x improvement in area efficiency over prior digital CiROM designs. Moreover, the DR eDRAM contributes to a 43.6% reduction in external DRAM access, further enhancing deployment efficiency for LLMs in edge applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ASP-DAC 2026</p></details> |
| **[CM-Align: Consistency-based Multilingual Alignment for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08541v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current large language models (LLMs) generally show a significant performance gap in alignment between English and other languages. To bridge this gap, existing research typically leverages the model's responses in English as a reference to select the best/worst responses in other languages, which are then used for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training. However, we argue that there are two limitations in the current methods that result in noisy multilingual preference data and further limited alignment performance: 1) Not all English responses are of high quality, and using a response with low quality may mislead the alignment for other languages. 2) Current methods usually use biased or heuristic approaches to construct multilingual preference pairs. To address these limitations, we design a consistency-based data selection method to construct high-quality multilingual preference data for improving multilingual alignment (CM-Align). Specifically, our method includes two parts: consistency-guided English reference selection and cross-lingual consistency-based multilingual preference data construction. Experimental results on three LLMs and three common tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method, which further indicates the necessity of constructing high-quality preference data.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |

Despite their progress, LVMs are prone to hallucinations-producing inaccurate or irrelevant descriptions. Current benchmarks for video hallucination depend heavily on manual categorization of video content, neglecting the perception-based processes through which humans naturally interpret videos. We introduce MESH, a benchmark designed to evaluate hallucinations in LVMs systematically. MESH uses a Question-Answering framework with binary and multi-choice formats incorporating target and trap instances. It follows a bottom-up approach, evaluating basic objects, coarse-to-fine subject features, and subject-action pairs, aligning with human video understanding. We demonstrate that MESH offers an effective and comprehensive approach for identifying hallucinations in videos. Our evaluations show that while LVMs excel at recognizing basic objects and features, their susceptibility to hallucinations increases markedly when handling fine details or aligning multiple actions involving various subjects in longer videos.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agents of Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08535v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The substantial data volumes encountered in modern particle physics and other domains of fundamental physics research allow (and require) the use of increasingly complex data analysis tools and workflows. While the use of machine learning (ML) tools for data analysis has recently proliferated, these tools are typically special-purpose algorithms that rely, for example, on encoded physics knowledge to reach optimal performance. In this work, we investigate a new and orthogonal direction: Using recent progress in large language models (LLMs) to create a team of agents -- instances of LLMs with specific subtasks -- that jointly solve data analysis-based research problems in a way similar to how a human researcher might: by creating code to operate standard tools and libraries (including ML systems) and by building on results of previous iterations. If successful, such agent-based systems could be deployed to automate routine analysis components to counteract the increasing complexity of modern tool chains. To investigate the capabilities of current-generation commercial LLMs, we consider the task of anomaly detection via the publicly available and highly-studied LHC Olympics dataset. Several current models by OpenAI (GPT-4o, o4-mini, GPT-4.1, and GPT-5) are investigated and their stability tested. Overall, we observe the capacity of the agent-based system to solve this data analysis problem. The best agent-created solutions mirror the performance of human state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |

While advancements in large language models (LLMs) promise improvements in the adaptability and quality of educational technologies for SRL, there remain concerns about the hallucinations in content generated by LLMs, which can compromise both the learning experience and ethical standards. To address these challenges, we proposed GenAI-enabled approaches for evaluating personalised SRL scaffolds before they are presented to students, aiming for reducing hallucinations and improving the overall quality of LLM-generated personalised scaffolds. Specifically, two approaches are investigated. The first approach involved developing a multi-agent system approach for reliability evaluation to assess the extent to which LLM-generated scaffolds accurately target relevant SRL processes. The second approach utilised the "LLM-as-a-Judge" technique for quality evaluation that evaluates LLM-generated scaffolds for their helpfulness in supporting students. We constructed evaluation datasets, and compared our results with single-agent LLM systems and machine learning approach baselines. Our findings indicate that the reliability evaluation approach is highly effective and outperforms the baselines, showing almost perfect alignment with human experts' evaluations. Moreover, both proposed evaluation approaches can be harnessed to effectively reduce hallucinations. Additionally, we identified and discussed bias limitations of the "LLM-as-a-Judge" technique in evaluating LLM-generated scaffolds. We suggest incorporating these approaches into GenAI-powered personalised SRL scaffolding systems to mitigate hallucination issues and improve the overall scaffolding quality.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches often adopt a "black-box" paradigm, where a single Large Language Model (LLM) makes end-to-end decisions. However, it is plagued by critical vulnerabilities, including poor spatial reasoning, weak cross-modal grounding, and memory overload in long-horizon tasks. To systematically address these issues, we propose Memory Spatial Navigation(MSNav), a framework that fuses three modules into a synergistic architecture, which transforms fragile inference into a robust, integrated intelligence. MSNav integrates three modules: Memory Module, a dynamic map memory module that tackles memory overload through selective node pruning, enhancing long-range exploration; Spatial Module, a module for spatial reasoning and object relationship inference that improves endpoint recognition; and Decision Module, a module using LLM-based path planning to execute robust actions. Powering Spatial Module, we also introduce an Instruction-Object-Space (I-O-S) dataset and fine-tune the Qwen3-4B model into Qwen-Spatial (Qwen-Sp), which outperforms leading commercial LLMs in object list extraction, achieving higher F1 and NDCG scores on the I-O-S test set. Extensive experiments on the Room-to-Room (R2R) and REVERIE datasets demonstrate MSNav's state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements in Success Rate (SR) and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL).</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[HumanAgencyBench: Scalable Evaluation of Human Agency Support in AI Assistants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08494v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As humans delegate more tasks and decisions to artificial intelligence (AI), we risk losing control of our individual and collective futures. Relatively simple algorithmic systems already steer human decision-making, such as social media feed algorithms that lead people to unintentionally and absent-mindedly scroll through engagement-optimized content. In this paper, we develop the idea of human agency by integrating philosophical and scientific theories of agency with AI-assisted evaluation methods: using large language models (LLMs) to simulate and validate user queries and to evaluate AI responses. We develop HumanAgencyBench (HAB), a scalable and adaptive benchmark with six dimensions of human agency based on typical AI use cases. HAB measures the tendency of an AI assistant or agent to Ask Clarifying Questions, Avoid Value Manipulation, Correct Misinformation, Defer Important Decisions, Encourage Learning, and Maintain Social Boundaries. We find low-to-moderate agency support in contemporary LLM-based assistants and substantial variation across system developers and dimensions. For example, while Anthropic LLMs most support human agency overall, they are the least supportive LLMs in terms of Avoid Value Manipulation. Agency support does not appear to consistently result from increasing LLM capabilities or instruction-following behavior (e.g., RLHF), and we encourage a shift towards more robust safety and alignment targets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Send to which account? Evaluation of an LLM-based Scambaiting System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08493v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scammers are increasingly harnessing generative AI(GenAI) technologies to produce convincing phishing content at scale, amplifying financial fraud and undermining public trust. While conventional defenses, such as detection algorithms, user training, and reactive takedown efforts remain important, they often fall short in dismantling the infrastructure scammers depend on, including mule bank accounts and cryptocurrency wallets. To bridge this gap, a proactive and emerging strategy involves using conversational honeypots to engage scammers and extract actionable threat intelligence. This paper presents the first large-scale, real-world evaluation of a scambaiting system powered by large language models (LLMs). Over a five-month deployment, the system initiated over 2,600 engagements with actual scammers, resulting in a dataset of more than 18,700 messages. It achieved an Information Disclosure Rate (IDR) of approximately 32%, successfully extracting sensitive financial information such as mule accounts. Additionally, the system maintained a Human Acceptance Rate (HAR) of around 70%, indicating strong alignment between LLM-generated responses and human operator preferences. Alongside these successes, our analysis reveals key operational challenges. In particular, the system struggled with engagement takeoff: only 48.7% of scammers responded to the initial seed message sent by defenders. These findings highlight the need for further refinement and provide actionable insights for advancing the design of automated scambaiting systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Too Helpful, Too Harmless, Too Honest or Just Right?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08486v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong performance across a wide range of NLP tasks, yet aligning their outputs with the principles of Helpfulness, Harmlessness, and Honesty (HHH) remains a persistent challenge. Existing methods often optimize for individual alignment dimensions in isolation, leading to trade-offs and inconsistent behavior. While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures offer modularity, they suffer from poorly calibrated routing, limiting their effectiveness in alignment tasks. We propose TrinityX, a modular alignment framework that incorporates a Mixture of Calibrated Experts (MoCaE) within the Transformer architecture. TrinityX leverages separately trained experts for each HHH dimension, integrating their outputs through a calibrated, task-adaptive routing mechanism that combines expert signals into a unified, alignment-aware representation. Extensive experiments on three standard alignment benchmarks-Alpaca (Helpfulness), BeaverTails (Harmlessness), and TruthfulQA (Honesty)-demonstrate that TrinityX outperforms strong baselines, achieving relative improvements of 32.5% in win rate, 33.9% in safety score, and 28.4% in truthfulness. In addition, TrinityX reduces memory usage and inference latency by over 40% compared to prior MoE-based approaches. Ablation studies highlight the importance of calibrated routing, and cross-model evaluations confirm TrinityX's generalization across diverse LLM backbones.</p></details> | EMNLP'25 Main |

Since Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be very influenceable by relatively small changes in input and are trained on human-generated data, it is reasonable to assume that they could show a similar tendency. We present a study investigating the presence of acquiescence bias in LLMs across different models, tasks, and languages (English, German, and Polish). Our results indicate that, contrary to humans, LLMs display a bias towards answering no, regardless of whether it indicates agreement or disagreement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |

This creates concerns about issue bias, where an LLM tends to present just one perspective on a given issue, which in turn may influence how users think about this issue. So far, it has not been possible to measure which issue biases LLMs manifest in real user interactions, making it difficult to address the risks from biased LLMs. Therefore, we create IssueBench: a set of 2.49m realistic English-language prompts to measure issue bias in LLM writing assistance, which we construct based on 3.9k templates (e.g. "write a blog about") and 212 political issues (e.g. "AI regulation") from real user interactions. Using IssueBench, we show that issue biases are common and persistent in 10 state-of-the-art LLMs. We also show that biases are very similar across models, and that all models align more with US Democrat than Republican voter opinion on a subset of issues. IssueBench can easily be adapted to include other issues, templates, or tasks. By enabling robust and realistic measurement, we hope that IssueBench can bring a new quality of evidence to ongoing discussions about LLM biases and how to address them.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at TACL (pre-MIT Press publication version)</p></details> |

In this work, we explore the applications of Vision Language Models (VLMs), specifically a fine-tuned variant of LLaMa 3.2, to the task of identifying neutrino interactions in pixelated detector data from high-energy physics (HEP) experiments. We benchmark this model against a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, similar to those used in the NOvA and DUNE experiments, which have achieved high efficiency and purity in classifying electron and muon neutrino events. Our evaluation considers both the classification performance and interpretability of the model predictions. We find that VLMs can outperform CNNs, while also providing greater flexibility in integrating auxiliary textual or semantic information and offering more interpretable, reasoning-based predictions. This work highlights the potential of VLMs as a general-purpose backbone for physics event classification, due to their high performance, interpretability, and generalizability, which opens new avenues for integrating multimodal reasoning in experimental neutrino physics.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce VIPER, a novel framework for multimodal instruction-based planning that integrates VLM-based perception with LLM-based reasoning. Our approach uses a modular pipeline where a frozen VLM generates textual descriptions of image observations, which are then processed by an LLM policy to predict actions based on the task goal. We fine-tune the reasoning module using behavioral cloning and reinforcement learning, improving our agent's decision-making capabilities. Experiments on the ALFWorld benchmark show that VIPER significantly outperforms state-of-the-art visual instruction-based planners while narrowing the gap with purely text-based oracles. By leveraging text as an intermediate representation, VIPER also enhances explainability, paving the way for a fine-grained analysis of perception and reasoning components.</p></details> |  |

This capability is especially critical in the legal domain. In this work, we introduce a novel end-to-end RAG pipeline that improves upon previous baselines using three targeted enhancements: (i) a context-aware query translator that disentangles document references from natural-language questions and adapts retrieval depth and response style based on expertise and specificity, (ii) open-source retrieval strategies using SBERT and GTE embeddings that achieve substantial performance gains while remaining cost-efficient, and (iii) a comprehensive evaluation and generation framework that combines RAGAS, BERTScore-F1, and ROUGE-Recall to assess semantic alignment and faithfulness across models and prompt designs. Our results show that carefully designed open-source pipelines can rival proprietary approaches in retrieval quality, while a custom legal-grounded prompt consistently produces more faithful and contextually relevant answers than baseline prompting. Taken together, these contributions demonstrate the potential of task-aware, component-level tuning to deliver legally grounded, reproducible, and cost-effective RAG systems for legal research assistance.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to NLLP 2025 Workshop</p></details> |

We present GlyphWeaver, a novel interactive system to enable an easy creation of expressive glyph visualizations. Our system comprises three key components: a glyph domain-specific language (GDSL), a GDSL operation management mechanism, and a multimodal interaction interface. The GDSL is a hierarchical container model, where each container is independent and composable, providing a rigorous yet practical foundation for complex glyph visualizations. The operation management mechanism restricts modifications of the GDSL to atomic operations, making it accessible without requiring direct coding. The multimodal interaction interface enables direct manipulation, natural language commands, and parameter adjustments. A multimodal large language model acts as a translator, converting these inputs into GDSL operations. GlyphWeaver significantly lowers the barrier for designers, who often do not have extensive programming skills, to create sophisticated glyph visualizations. A case study and user interviews with 13 participants confirm its substantial gains in design efficiency and effectiveness of producing creative glyph visualizations.</p></details> |  |

We introduce MachineLearningLM, a portable continued-pretraining framework that equips a general-purpose LLM with robust in-context ML capability while preserving its general knowledge and reasoning for broader chat workflows. Our pretraining procedure synthesizes ML tasks from millions of structural causal models (SCMs), spanning shot counts up to 1,024. We begin with a random-forest teacher, distilling tree-based decision strategies into the LLM to strengthen robustness in numerical modeling. All tasks are serialized with a token-efficient prompt, enabling 3x to 6x more examples per context window and delivering up to 50x amortized throughput via batch inference. Despite a modest setup (Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct with LoRA rank 8), MachineLearningLM outperforms strong LLM baselines (e.g., GPT-5-mini) by an average of about 15% on out-of-distribution tabular classification across finance, physics, biology, and healthcare domains. It exhibits a striking many-shot scaling law: accuracy increases monotonically as in-context demonstrations grow from 8 to 1,024. Without any task-specific training, it attains random-forest-level accuracy across hundreds of shots. General chat capabilities, including knowledge and reasoning, are preserved: it achieves 75.4% on MMLU.</p></details> |  |
| **[Metis: Training Large Language Models with Advanced Low-Bit Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00404v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work identifies anisotropic parameter distributions as a fundamental barrier to training large language models (LLMs) with low-bit quantization: a few dominant singular values create wide numerical ranges that conflict with the inherent bias of block-wise quantization. This bias disproportionately preserves high-magnitude values while discarding smaller ones, causing training instability and low model performance. This work introduces Metis, a training framework that combines (i) spectral decomposition with random embedding to efficiently disentangle dominant from long-tail components, compressing broad distributions into quantization-friendly narrow ranges; (ii) adaptive learning rates in the spectral domain to amplify underrepresented directions and better capture diverse features critical for performance; and (iii) a dual-range regularizer that jointly constrains numerical precision and parameter range distribution, ensuring stable, unbiased low-bit training. With Metis, FP8 training surpasses FP32 baselines, and FP4 training achieves accuracy comparable to FP32, paving the way for robust and scalable LLM training under advanced low-bit quantization. The code implementation for Metis is available at: https://github.com/sii-research/Metis.</p></details> |  |

However, their application to hardware description languages, such as Verilog, is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality training data. Current approaches to Verilog code generation using LLMs often focus on syntactic correctness, resulting in code with functional errors. To address these challenges, we present AutoVeriFix, a novel Python-assisted two-stage framework designed to enhance the functional correctness of LLM-generated Verilog code. In the first stage, LLMs are employed to generate high-level Python reference models that define the intended circuit behavior. In the second stage, these Python models facilitate the creation of automated tests that guide the generation of Verilog RTL implementations. Simulation discrepancies between the reference model and the Verilog code are iteratively used to identify and correct errors, thereby improving the functional accuracy and reliability of the LLM-generated Verilog code. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in improving the functional correctness of generated Verilog code.</p></details> |  |

This study proposes an adaptive weight optimization framework for SIBT planning, driven by large language models (LLMs). A locally deployed DeepSeek-R1 LLM is integrated with an automatic planning algorithm in an iterative loop. Starting with fixed weights, the LLM evaluates plan quality and recommends new weights in the next iteration. This process continues until convergence criteria are met, after which the LLM conducts a comprehensive evaluation to identify the optimal plan. A clinical knowledge base, constructed and queried via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), enhances the model's domain-specific reasoning. The proposed method was validated on 23 patient cases, showing that the LLM-assisted approach produces plans that are comparable to or exceeding clinically approved and fixed-weight plans, in terms of dose homogeneity for the clinical target volume (CTV) and sparing of organs at risk (OARs). The study demonstrates the potential use of LLMs in SIBT planning automation.</p></details> |  |

At the same time, thanks to improvements in large language models (LLMs), there has also been a rapid development in AI agents that interact with and affect change in their surrounding environments. But how performant are AI agents at accelerating or even autonomously performing work-related tasks? The answer to this question has important implications both for industry looking to adopt AI into their workflows and for economic policy to understand the effects that adoption of AI may have on the labor market. To measure the progress of these LLM agents' performance on performing real-world professional tasks, in this paper we introduce TheAgentCompany, an extensible benchmark for evaluating AI agents that interact with the world in similar ways to those of a digital worker: by browsing the Web, writing code, running programs, and communicating with other coworkers. We build a self-contained environment with internal web sites and data that mimics a small software company environment, and create a variety of tasks that may be performed by workers in such a company. We test baseline agents powered by both closed API-based and open-weights language models (LMs), and find that the most competitive agent can complete 30% of tasks autonomously. This paints a nuanced picture on task automation with LM agents--in a setting simulating a real workplace, a good portion of simpler tasks could be solved autonomously, but more difficult long-horizon tasks are still beyond the reach of current systems. We release code, data, environment, and experiments on https://the-agent-company.com.</p></details> | Preprint |

Although several multimodal reasoning models have been explored in the medical domain, most of them focus exclusively on basic reasoning, which refers to shallow inference based on visual feature matching. However, real-world clinical diagnosis extends beyond basic reasoning, demanding reasoning processes that integrate heterogeneous clinical information (such as chief complaints and medical history) with multimodal medical imaging data. To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-Retinal-Reason, the first ophthalmic multimodal dataset with the full spectrum of perception and reasoning. It encompasses both basic reasoning tasks and complex reasoning tasks, aiming to enhance visual-centric fundamental reasoning capabilities and emulate realistic clinical thinking patterns. Building upon MM-Retinal-Reason, we propose OphthaReason, the first ophthalmology-specific multimodal reasoning model with step-by-step reasoning traces. To enable flexible adaptation to both basic and complex reasoning tasks, we specifically design a novel method called Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic Thinking (UADT), which estimates sample-level uncertainty via entropy and dynamically modulates the model's exploration depth using a shaped advantage mechanism. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on both basic and complex reasoning tasks, outperforming general-purpose MLLMs, medical MLLMs, RL-based medical MLLMs, and ophthalmic MLLMs by at least 24.92\%, 15.00\%, 21.20\%, and 17.66\%.

However, discovering ans\"atze that are both expressive and hardware-efficient remains a key challenge, particularly on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. In this work, we introduce a prompt-based framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate hardware-aware QCBM architectures. Prompts are conditioned on qubit connectivity, gate error rates, and hardware topology, while iterative feedback, including Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, circuit depth, and validity, is used to refine the circuits. We evaluate our method on a financial modeling task involving daily changes in Japanese government bond (JGB) interest rates. Our results show that the LLM-generated ans\"atze are significantly shallower and achieve superior generative performance compared to the standard baseline when executed on real IBM quantum hardware using 12 qubits. These findings demonstrate the practical utility of LLM-driven quantum architecture search and highlight a promising path toward robust, deployable generative models for near-term quantum devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work presented at the 3rd International Workshop on Quantum Machine Learning: From Research to Practice (QML@QCE'25)</p></details> |

However, neural text generation requires decoding methods like argmax and sampling, which are non-polynomial and thus computationally expensive under encryption, creating a significant performance bottleneck. We introduce cutmax, an HE-friendly argmax algorithm that reduces ciphertext operations compared to prior methods, enabling practical greedy decoding under encryption. We also propose the first HE-compatible nucleus (top-p) sampling method, leveraging cutmax for efficient stochastic decoding with provable privacy guarantees. Both techniques are polynomial, supporting efficient inference in privacy-preserving settings. Moreover, their differentiability facilitates gradient-based sequence-level optimization as a polynomial alternative to straight-through estimators. We further provide strong theoretical guarantees for cutmax, proving it converges globally to a unique two-level fixed point, independent of the input values beyond the identity of the maximizer, which explains its rapid convergence in just a few iterations. Evaluations on realistic LLM outputs show latency reductions of 24x-35x over baselines, advancing secure text generation.</p></details> |  |

Most recent instruction-tuning studies focus on seven-billion-parameter or larger models, leaving limited evidence on whether much smaller models can work reliably under low-resource, multi-task conditions. This work presents ETLCH, a billion-parameter LLaMA-based model fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation on only a few hundred to one thousand samples per task for JSON extraction, knowledge graph extraction, and named entity recognition. Despite its small scale, ETLCH outperforms strong baselines across most evaluation metrics, with substantial gains observed even at the lowest data scale. These findings demonstrate that well-tuned small models can deliver stable and accurate structured outputs at a fraction of the computational cost, enabling cost-effective and reliable information extraction pipelines in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, includes experiments on JSON extraction, knowledge graph extraction, and NER</p></details> |
| **[Co-Investigator AI: The Rise of Agentic AI for Smarter, Trustworthy AML Compliance Narratives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08380v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating regulatorily compliant Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) remains a high-cost, low-scalability bottleneck in Anti-Money Laundering (AML) workflows. While large language models (LLMs) offer promising fluency, they suffer from factual hallucination, limited crime typology alignment, and poor explainability -- posing unacceptable risks in compliance-critical domains. This paper introduces Co-Investigator AI, an agentic framework optimized to produce Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) significantly faster and with greater accuracy than traditional methods. Drawing inspiration from recent advances in autonomous agent architectures, such as the AI Co-Scientist, our approach integrates specialized agents for planning, crime type detection, external intelligence gathering, and compliance validation. The system features dynamic memory management, an AI-Privacy Guard layer for sensitive data handling, and a real-time validation agent employing the Agent-as-a-Judge paradigm to ensure continuous narrative quality assurance. Human investigators remain firmly in the loop, empowered to review and refine drafts in a collaborative workflow that blends AI efficiency with domain expertise. We demonstrate the versatility of Co-Investigator AI across a range of complex financial crime scenarios, highlighting its ability to streamline SAR drafting, align narratives with regulatory expectations, and enable compliance teams to focus on higher-order analytical work. This approach marks the beginning of a new era in compliance reporting -- bringing the transformative benefits of AI agents to the core of regulatory processes and paving the way for scalable, reliable, and transparent SAR generation.</p></details> |  |

Most LLMs generate the final result based solely on a single query and LLM's reasoning capabilities. However, with the advent of OpenAI-o1, 'slow thinking' techniques have garnered increasing attention because its process is closer to the human thought process. Inspired by the human ability to constantly associate and replenish knowledge during thinking, we developed the novel Chain-of-Associated-Thoughts (CoAT) framework, which introduces an innovative synergy between the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm and a dynamic mechanism for integrating new key information, termed 'associative memory'. By combining the structured exploration capabilities of MCTS with the adaptive learning capacity of associative memory, CoAT significantly expands the LLM search space, enabling our framework to explore diverse reasoning pathways and dynamically update its knowledge base in real-time. This allows the framework to not only revisit and refine earlier inferences but also adaptively incorporate evolving information, ensuring that the final output is both accurate and comprehensive. We validate CoAT's effectiveness across a variety of generative and reasoning tasks. Quantitative experiments show that CoAT achieves over 10% performance improvement on open-source multi-hop reasoning datasets (HotpotQA, MuSiQue) and more than 15% gain on our proprietary CRB dataset.</p></details> | 18 pages, 10 figures |

However, their performance in sensitive domains such as text detoxification has not received proper attention from the scientific community. This paper explores the possibility of using LLM-generated synthetic toxic data as an alternative to human-generated data for training models for detoxification. Using Llama 3 and Qwen activation-patched models, we generated synthetic toxic counterparts for neutral texts from ParaDetox and SST-2 datasets. Our experiments show that models fine-tuned on synthetic data consistently perform worse than those trained on human data, with a drop in performance of up to 30% in joint metrics. The root cause is identified as a critical lexical diversity gap: LLMs generate toxic content using a small, repetitive vocabulary of insults that fails to capture the nuances and variety of human toxicity. These findings highlight the limitations of current LLMs in this domain and emphasize the continued importance of diverse, human-annotated data for building robust detoxification systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating Mixture-of-Expert Inference with Adaptive Expert Split Mechanism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08342v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising architecture for modern large language models (LLMs). However, massive parameters impose heavy GPU memory (i.e., VRAM) demands, hindering the widespread adoption of MoE LLMs. Offloading the expert parameters to CPU RAM offers an effective way to alleviate the VRAM requirements for MoE inference. Existing approaches typically cache a small subset of experts in VRAM and dynamically prefetch experts from RAM during inference, leading to significant degradation in inference speed due to the poor cache hit rate and substantial expert loading latency. In this work, we propose MoEpic, an efficient MoE inference system with a novel expert split mechanism. Specifically, each expert is vertically divided into two segments: top and bottom. MoEpic caches the top segment of hot experts, so that more experts will be stored under the limited VRAM budget, thereby improving the cache hit rate. During each layer's inference, MoEpic predicts and prefetches the activated experts for the next layer. Since the top segments of cached experts are exempt from fetching, the loading time is reduced, which allows efficient transfer-computation overlap. Nevertheless, the performance of MoEpic critically depends on the cache configuration (i.e., each layer's VRAM budget and expert split ratio). To this end, we propose a divide-and-conquer algorithm based on fixed-point iteration for adaptive cache configuration. Extensive experiments on popular MoE LLMs demonstrate that MoEpic can save about half of the GPU cost, while lowering the inference latency by about 37.51%-65.73% compared to the baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks often lack relevance to real-world AI programming scenarios, making them inadequate for assessing the practical security risks associated with AI-generated code in production environments. To address this gap, we introduce A.S.E (AI Code Generation Security Evaluation), a repository-level evaluation benchmark designed to closely mirror real-world AI programming tasks, offering a comprehensive and reliable framework for assessing the security of AI-generated code. Our evaluation of leading LLMs on A.S.E reveals several key findings. In particular, current LLMs still struggle with secure coding. The complexity in repository-level scenarios presents challenges for LLMs that typically perform well on snippet-level tasks. Morever, a larger reasoning budget does not necessarily lead to better code generation. These observations offer valuable insights into the current state of AI code generation, assisting developers in selecting the most appropriate models for practical tasks, while laying the foundation for refining LLMs to generate secure and efficient code in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating Reinforcement Learning Algorithms Convergence using Pre-trained Large Language Models as Tutors With Advice Reusing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08329v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms often require long training to become useful, especially in complex environments with sparse rewards. While techniques like reward shaping and curriculum learning exist to accelerate training, these are often extremely specific and require the developer's professionalism and dedicated expertise in the problem's domain. Tackling this challenge, in this study, we explore the effectiveness of pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) as tutors in a student-teacher architecture with RL algorithms, hypothesizing that LLM-generated guidance allows for faster convergence. In particular, we explore the effectiveness of reusing the LLM's advice on the RL's convergence dynamics. Through an extensive empirical examination, which included 54 configurations, varying the RL algorithm (DQN, PPO, A2C), LLM tutor (Llama, Vicuna, DeepSeek), and environment (Blackjack, Snake, Connect Four), our results demonstrate that LLM tutoring significantly accelerates RL convergence while maintaining comparable optimal performance. Furthermore, the advice reuse mechanism shows a further improvement in training duration but also results in less stable convergence dynamics. Our findings suggest that LLM tutoring generally improves convergence, and its effectiveness is sensitive to the specific task, RL algorithm, and LLM model combination.</p></details> |  |

To bypass these detectors, paraphrase attacks have emerged to purposely rewrite these texts to evade detection. Despite the success, existing methods require substantial data and computational budgets to train a specialized paraphraser, and their attack efficacy greatly reduces when faced with advanced detection algorithms. To address this, we propose \textbf{Co}ntrastive \textbf{P}araphrase \textbf{A}ttack (CoPA), a training-free method that effectively deceives text detectors using off-the-shelf LLMs. The first step is to carefully craft instructions that encourage LLMs to produce more human-like texts. Nonetheless, we observe that the inherent statistical biases of LLMs can still result in some generated texts carrying certain machine-like attributes that can be captured by detectors. To overcome this, CoPA constructs an auxiliary machine-like word distribution as a contrast to the human-like distribution generated by the LLM. By subtracting the machine-like patterns from the human-like distribution during the decoding process, CoPA is able to produce sentences that are less discernible by text detectors. Our theoretical analysis suggests the superiority of the proposed attack. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CoPA in fooling text detectors across various scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP-2025</p></details> |

Adoption Patterns of Large Language Models in Scholarly Writing and Citation Outcomes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08306v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of generative AI tools is reshaping how scholars produce and communicate knowledge, raising questions about who benefits and who is left behind. We analyze over 230,000 Scopus-indexed computer science articles between 2021 and 2025 to examine how AI-assisted writing alters scholarly visibility across regions. Using zero-shot detection of AI-likeness, we track stylistic changes in writing and link them to citation counts, journal placement, and global citation flows before and after ChatGPT. Our findings reveal uneven outcomes: authors in the Global East adopt AI tools more aggressively, yet Western authors gain more per unit of adoption due to pre-existing penalties for "humanlike" writing. Prestigious journals continue to privilege more human-sounding texts, creating tensions between visibility and gatekeeping. Network analyses show modest increases in Eastern visibility and tighter intra-regional clustering, but little structural integration overall. These results highlight how AI adoption reconfigures the labor of academic writing and reshapes opportunities for recognition.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Adaptive Monitoring and Real-World Evaluation of Agentic AI Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00115v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic artificial intelligence (AI) -- multi-agent systems that combine large language models with external tools and autonomous planning -- are rapidly transitioning from research laboratories into high-stakes domains. Our earlier "Basic" paper introduced a five-axis framework and proposed preliminary metrics such as goal drift and harm reduction but did not provide an algorithmic instantiation or empirical evidence. This "Advanced" sequel fills that gap. First, we revisit recent benchmarks and industrial deployments to show that technical metrics still dominate evaluations: a systematic review of 84 papers from 2023--2025 found that 83% report capability metrics while only 30% consider human-centred or economic axes [2]. Second, we formalise an Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Monitoring (AMDM) algorithm that normalises heterogeneous metrics, applies per-axis exponentially weighted moving-average thresholds and performs joint anomaly detection via the Mahalanobis distance. Third, we conduct simulations and real-world experiments. AMDM cuts anomaly-detection latency from 12.3 s to 5.6 s on simulated goal drift and reduces false-positive rates from 4.5% to 0.9% compared with static thresholds. We present a comparison table and ROC/PR curves, and we reanalyse case studies to surface missing metrics. Code, data and a reproducibility checklist accompany this paper to facilitate replication.

Traditional alignment methods often rely on resource-intensive fine-tuning (FT), which may suffer from knowledge degradation and face challenges in scenarios where the model accessibility or computational resources are constrained. In contrast, training-free (TF) alignment techniques--leveraging in-context learning, decoding-time adjustments, and post-generation corrections--offer a promising alternative by enabling alignment without heavily retraining LLMs, making them adaptable to both open-source and closed-source environments. This paper presents the first systematic review of TF alignment methods, categorizing them by stages of pre-decoding, in-decoding, and post-decoding. For each stage, we provide a detailed examination from the viewpoint of LLMs and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), highlighting their mechanisms and limitations. Furthermore, we identify key challenges and future directions, paving the way for more inclusive and effective TF alignment techniques. By synthesizing and organizing the rapidly growing body of research, this survey offers a guidance for practitioners and advances the development of safer and more reliable LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 (findings), camera-ready version</p></details> |

It is therefore beneficial to develop an efficient method that can automatically extract training instances from unlabeled texts for training RE models. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been adopted in various natural language processing tasks, with RE also benefiting from their advances. However, when leveraging LLMs for RE with predefined relation categories, two key challenges arise. First, in a multi-class classification setting, LLMs often struggle to comprehensively capture the semantics of every relation, leading to suboptimal results. Second, although employing binary classification for each relation individually can mitigate this issue, it introduces significant computational overhead, resulting in impractical time complexity for real-world applications. Therefore, this paper proposes a framework called M-BRe to extract training instances from unlabeled texts for RE. It utilizes three modules to combine the advantages of both of the above classification approaches: Relation Grouping, Relation Extraction, and Label Decision. Extensive experiments confirm its superior capability in discovering high-quality training samples from unlabeled texts for RE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP2025 Main Conference</p></details> |
| **[A Systematic Survey on Large Language Models for Evolutionary Optimization: From Modeling to Solving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08269v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs), with their strong understanding and reasoning capabilities, are increasingly being explored for tackling optimization problems, especially in synergy with evolutionary computation. Despite rapid progress, however, the field still lacks a unified synthesis and a systematic taxonomy. This survey addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review of recent developments and organizing them within a structured framework. We classify existing research into two main stages: LLMs for optimization modeling and LLMs for optimization solving. The latter is further divided into three paradigms according to the role of LLMs in the optimization workflow: LLMs as stand-alone optimizers, low-level LLMs embedded within optimization algorithms, and high-level LLMs for algorithm selection and generation. For each category, we analyze representative methods, distill technical challenges, and examine their interplay with traditional approaches. We also review interdisciplinary applications spanning the natural sciences, engineering, and machine learning. By contrasting LLM-driven and conventional methods, we highlight key limitations and research gaps, and point toward future directions for developing self-evolving agentic ecosystems for optimization.

Existing studies primarily suffer from two limitations: (1) A heavy reliance on scarce, high-quality long-form response data for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or for pairwise preference reward in reinforcement learning (RL). (2) Focus on coarse-grained quality optimization dimensions, such as relevance, coherence, and helpfulness, overlooking the fine-grained specifics inherent to diverse long-form generation scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a framework using Adaptive Constraint-Enhanced reward for long-form generation Reinforcement Learning (ACE-RL). ACE-RL first automatically deconstructs each instruction into a set of fine-grained, adaptive constraint criteria by identifying its underlying intents and demands. Subsequently, we design a reward mechanism that quantifies the quality of long-form responses based on their satisfaction over corresponding constraints, converting subjective quality evaluation into constraint verification. Finally, we utilize reinforcement learning to guide models toward superior long-form generation capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our ACE-RL framework significantly outperforms existing SFT and RL baselines by 20.70% and 7.32% on WritingBench, and our top-performing model even surpasses proprietary systems like GPT-4o by 7.10%, providing a more effective training paradigm for LLMs to generate high-quality content across diverse long-form generation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review, our code is available at https://github.com/ZNLP/ACE-RL</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose the Forgetting-Aware Pruning Metric (FAPM), a novel pruning-based approach to balance CF and downstream task performance. Our investigation reveals that the degree to which task vectors (i.e., the subtraction of pre-trained weights from the weights fine-tuned on downstream tasks) overlap with pre-trained model parameters is a critical factor for CF. Based on this finding, FAPM employs the ratio of the task vector to pre-trained model parameters as a metric to quantify CF, integrating this measure into the pruning criteria. Importantly, FAPM does not necessitate modifications to the training process or model architecture, nor does it require any auxiliary data. We conducted extensive experiments across eight datasets, covering natural language inference, General Q&A, Medical Q&A, Math Q&A, reading comprehension, and cloze tests. The results demonstrate that FAPM limits CF to just 0.25\% while maintaining 99.67\% accuracy on downstream tasks. We provide the code to reproduce our results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by emnlp2025</p></details> |

Traditional RAG systems primarily rely on the in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of the large language model itself. Still, in-depth research on the specific capabilities needed by the RAG generation model is lacking, leading to challenges with inconsistent document quality and retrieval system imperfections. Even the limited studies that fine-tune RAG generative models often \textit{lack a granular focus on RAG task} or \textit{a deeper utilization of chain-of-thought processes}. To address this, we propose that RAG models should possess three progressively hierarchical abilities (1) Filtering: the ability to select relevant information; (2) Combination: the ability to combine semantic information across paragraphs; and (3) RAG-specific reasoning: the ability to further process external knowledge using internal knowledge. Thus, we introduce our new RAG instruction fine-tuning method, Hierarchical-Thought Instruction-Tuning Retrieval-Augmented Generation (HIRAG) incorporates a "think before answering" strategy. This method enhances the model's open-book examination capability by utilizing multi-level progressive chain-of-thought. Experiments show that the HIRAG training strategy significantly improves the model's performance on datasets such as RGB, PopQA, MuSiQue, HotpotQA, and PubmedQA.</p></details> |  |
| **[CITER: Collaborative Inference for Efficient Large Language Model Decoding with Token-Level Routing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01976v6)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have achieved remarkable success in various tasks but suffer from high computational costs during inference, limiting their deployment in resource-constrained applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel Collaborative Inference with Token-lEvel Routing (CITER) framework that enables efficient collaboration between small and large language models (SLMs \& LLMs) through a token-level routing strategy. Specifically, CITER routes non-critical tokens to an SLM for efficiency and routes critical tokens to an LLM for generalization quality. We formulate router training as a policy optimization, where the router receives rewards based on both the quality of predictions and the inference costs of generation. This allows the router to learn to predict token-level routing scores and make routing decisions based on both the current token and the future impact of its decisions. To further accelerate the reward evaluation process, we introduce a shortcut which significantly reduces the costs of the reward estimation and improving the practicality of our approach. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that CITER reduces the inference costs while preserving high-quality generation, offering a promising solution for real-time and resource-constrained applications. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/aiming-lab/CITER.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, we propose CoT-RAG, a novel reasoning framework with three key designs: (i) Knowledge Graph-driven CoT Generation, featuring knowledge graphs to modulate reasoning chain generation of LLMs, thereby enhancing reasoning credibility; (ii) Learnable Knowledge Case-aware RAG, which incorporates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) into knowledge graphs to retrieve relevant sub-cases and sub-descriptions, providing LLMs with learnable information; (iii) Pseudo Program Prompting Execution, which promotes greater logical rigor by guiding LLMs to execute reasoning tasks as pseudo-programs. Evaluations on nine public datasets spanning three reasoning tasks reveal significant accuracy gains-ranging from 4.0% to 44.3%-over state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, tests on four domain-specific datasets demonstrate exceptional accuracy and efficient execution, underscoring its practical applicability and scalability.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have changed the landscape of NLP by enabling more accessible and automated text analysis (e.g., topic detection, summarization, information extraction, etc.). We introduce VIDEE, a system that supports entry-level data analysts to conduct advanced text analytics with intelligent agents. VIDEE instantiates a human-agent collaroration workflow consisting of three stages: (1) Decomposition, which incorporates a human-in-the-loop Monte-Carlo Tree Search algorithm to support generative reasoning with human feedback, (2) Execution, which generates an executable text analytics pipeline, and (3) Evaluation, which integrates LLM-based evaluation and visualizations to support user validation of execution results. We conduct two quantitative experiments to evaluate VIDEE's effectiveness and analyze common agent errors. A user study involving participants with varying levels of NLP and text analytics experience -- from none to expert -- demonstrates the system's usability and reveals distinct user behavior patterns. The findings identify design implications for human-agent collaboration, validate the practical utility of VIDEE for non-expert users, and inform future improvements to intelligent text analytics systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Arce: Augmented Roberta with Contextualized Elucidations for Ner in Automated Rule Checking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07286v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate information extraction from specialized texts is a critical challenge, particularly for named entity recognition (NER) in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) domain to support automated rule checking (ARC). The performance of standard pre-trained models is often constrained by the domain gap, as they struggle to interpret the specialized terminology and complex relational contexts inherent in AEC texts. Although this issue can be mitigated by further pre-training on large, human-curated domain corpora, as exemplified by methods like ARCBERT, this approach is both labor-intensive and cost-prohibitive. Consequently, leveraging large language models (LLMs) for automated knowledge generation has emerged as a promising alternative. However, the optimal strategy for generating knowledge that can genuinely enhance smaller, efficient models remains an open question. To address this, we propose ARCE (augmented RoBERTa with contextualized elucidations), a novel approach that systematically explores and optimizes this generation process. ARCE employs an LLM to first generate a corpus of simple, direct explanations, which we term Cote, and then uses this corpus to incrementally pre-train a RoBERTa model prior to its fine-tuning on the downstream task. Our extensive experiments show that ARCE establishes a new state-of-the-art on a benchmark AEC dataset, achieving a Macro-F1 score of 77.20%. This result also reveals a key finding: simple, explanation-based knowledge proves surprisingly more effective than complex, role-based rationales for this task. The code is publicly available at:https://github.com/nxcc-lab/ARCE.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks mostly test surface-level parsing, such as reading labels and legends, while overlooking deeper scientific reasoning. We propose DomainCQA, a framework for constructing domain-specific CQA benchmarks that emphasize both visual comprehension and knowledge-intensive reasoning. It integrates complexity-aware chart selection, multitier QA generation, and expert validation. Applied to astronomy, DomainCQA yields AstroChart, a benchmark of 1,690 QA pairs over 482 charts, exposing persistent weaknesses in fine-grained perception, numerical reasoning, and domain knowledge integration across 21 MLLMs. Fine-tuning on AstroChart improves performance across fundamental and advanced tasks. Pilot QA sets in biochemistry, economics, medicine, and social science further demonstrate DomainCQA's generality. Together, our results establish DomainCQA as a unified pipeline for constructing and augmenting domain-specific chart reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> | 85 pages, 59 figures |

To address this gap, we introduce MetaExplainer, a neuro-symbolic framework designed to generate user-centered explanations. Our approach employs a three-stage process: first, we decompose user questions into machine-readable formats using state-of-the-art large language models (LLM); second, we delegate the task of generating system recommendations to model explainer methods; and finally, we synthesize natural language explanations that summarize the explainer outputs. Throughout this process, we utilize an Explanation Ontology to guide the language models and explainer methods. By leveraging LLMs and a structured approach to explanation generation, MetaExplainer aims to enhance the interpretability and trustworthiness of AI systems across various applications, providing users with tailored, question-driven explanations that better meet their needs. Comprehensive evaluations of MetaExplainer demonstrate a step towards evaluating and utilizing current state-of-the-art explanation frameworks.

| **[Exploratory Retrieval-Augmented Planning For Continual Embodied Instruction Following](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08222v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents an Exploratory Retrieval-Augmented Planning (ExRAP) framework, designed to tackle continual instruction following tasks of embodied agents in dynamic, non-stationary environments. The framework enhances Large Language Models' (LLMs) embodied reasoning capabilities by efficiently exploring the physical environment and establishing the environmental context memory, thereby effectively grounding the task planning process in time-varying environment contexts. In ExRAP, given multiple continual instruction following tasks, each instruction is decomposed into queries on the environmental context memory and task executions conditioned on the query results. To efficiently handle these multiple tasks that are performed continuously and simultaneously, we implement an exploration-integrated task planning scheme by incorporating the {information-based exploration} into the LLM-based planning process. Combined with memory-augmented query evaluation, this integrated scheme not only allows for a better balance between the validity of the environmental context memory and the load of environment exploration, but also improves overall task performance. Furthermore, we devise a {temporal consistency refinement} scheme for query evaluation to address the inherent decay of knowledge in the memory. Through experiments with VirtualHome, ALFRED, and CARLA, our approach demonstrates robustness against a variety of embodied instruction following scenarios involving different instruction scales and types, and non-stationarity degrees, and it consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art LLM-based task planning approaches in terms of both goal success rate and execution efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages.

While recent large language model (LLM) benchmarks emphasize in-visit diagnostic reasoning, they fail to evaluate models' ability to support patients after the visit. We introduce DischargeSim, a novel benchmark that evaluates LLMs on their ability to act as personalized discharge educators. DischargeSim simulates post-visit, multi-turn conversations between LLM-driven DoctorAgents and PatientAgents with diverse psychosocial profiles (e.g., health literacy, education, emotion). Interactions are structured across six clinically grounded discharge topics and assessed along three axes: (1) dialogue quality via automatic and LLM-as-judge evaluation, (2) personalized document generation including free-text summaries and structured AHRQ checklists, and (3) patient comprehension through a downstream multiple-choice exam. Experiments across 18 LLMs reveal significant gaps in discharge education capability, with performance varying widely across patient profiles. Notably, model size does not always yield better education outcomes, highlighting trade-offs in strategy use and content prioritization. DischargeSim offers a first step toward benchmarking LLMs in post-visit clinical education and promoting equitable, personalized patient support.</p></details> | <details><summary>Equal...</summary><p>Equal contribution for the first two authors.

To address this gap, we present PolicyStory, an information tool designed to offer lucid, chronological, and summarized insights into Indian policy issues. PolicyStory collects news articles from diverse sources, clusters them by topic, and generates three levels of summaries from longitudinal media discourse on policies, leveraging open source large language models. A user study around the tool indicated that PolicyStory effectively aided users in grasping policy developments over time, with positive feedback highlighting its usability and clarity of summaries. By providing users a birds' eye view of complex policy topics, PolicyStory serves as a valuable resource.</p></details> |  |

We present componentization, an approach that decomposes model outputs into modular, independently editable units while preserving context. We describe Modular and Adaptable Output Decomposition (MAOD), which segments responses into coherent components and maintains links among them, and we outline the Component-Based Response Architecture (CBRA) as one way to implement this idea. Our reference prototype, MAODchat, uses a microservices design with state-machine-based decomposition agents, vendor-agnostic model adapters, and real-time component manipulation with recomposition. In an exploratory study with four participants from academic, engineering, and product roles, we observed that component-level editing aligned with several common workflows and enabled iterative refinement and selective reuse. Participants also mentioned possible team workflows. Our contributions are: (1) a definition of componentization for transforming monolithic outputs into manipulable units, (2) CBRA and MAODchat as a prototype architecture, (3) preliminary observations from a small user study, (4) MAOD as an algorithmic sketch for semantic segmentation, and (5) example Agent-to-Agent protocols for automated decomposition. We view componentization as a promising direction for turning passive text consumption into more active, component-level collaboration.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

In computer science, methods gain popularity after surpassing benchmarks of predictive accuracy, becoming the "state of the art." Computer scientists favor novelty and innovation for different reasons, but prioritizing technical prestige over methodological fit could unintentionally limit the scope of sociological inquiry. To illustrate, we focus on computational text analysis and revisit a prior study of college admissions essays, comparing analyses with both older and newer methods. These methods vary in flexibility and opacity, allowing us to compare performance across distinct methodological regimes. We find that newer techniques did not outperform prior results in meaningful ways. We also find that using the current state of the art, generative AI and large language models, could introduce bias and confounding that is difficult to extricate. We therefore argue that sociological inquiry benefits from methodological pluralism that aligns analytic choices with theoretical and empirical questions. While we frame this sociologically, scholars in other disciplines may confront what we call the "state-of-the-art fallacy", the belief that the tool computer scientists deem to be the best will work across topics, domains, and questions.</p></details> |  |

We develop a logic-first treatment of XML prompting that unifies (i) grammar-constrained decoding, (ii) fixed-point semantics over lattices of hierarchical prompts, and (iii) convergent human-AI interaction loops. We formalize a complete lattice of XML trees under a refinement order and prove that monotone prompt-to-prompt operators admit least fixed points (Knaster-Tarski) that characterize steady-state protocols; under a task-aware contraction metric on trees, we further prove Banach-style convergence of iterative guidance. We instantiate these results with context-free grammars (CFGs) for XML schemas and show how constrained decoding guarantees well-formedness while preserving task performance. A set of multi-layer human-AI interaction recipes demonstrates practical deployment patterns, including multi-pass "plan $\to$ verify $\to$ revise" routines and agentic tool use. We provide mathematically complete proofs and tie our framework to recent advances in grammar-aligned decoding, chain-of-verification, and programmatic prompting.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, multiple XML prompts</p></details> |

We hypothesize that a pre-trained language model can improve its reasoning skills given only a single prompt specifying the topic (e.g., algebra word problems) and asking the model to generate its own questions. To do this, we propose Self-Questioning Language Models (SQLM): an asymmetric self-play framework where a proposer is given the topic and generates a question for a solver, who tries to answer it. Both the proposer and solver are trained via reinforcement learning. The proposer receives a reward if the problem is not too easy or too difficult, and the solver receives a reward based on majority voting, a proxy for correctness in the absence of ground-truth answers. For coding, the proposer can instead generate unit tests which are used for verification. We study this asymmetric self-play framework on three benchmarks: three-digit multiplication, algebra problems from the OMEGA benchmark, and programming problems from Codeforces. By continually generating more interesting problems and attempting to solve them, language models can improve on downstream benchmarks without access to any curated training datasets.</p></details> |  |

We test o1-mini, o3-mini, DeepSeek-R1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview, and Grok 3 Mini Beta on graph coloring as a variable-complexity constraint-satisfaction logic problem, and find evidence from both error rate comparisons and CoT/explanation text analysis that RLLMs are prone to hallucinate graph edges not specified in the prompt. This phenomenon persists across multiple problem complexity levels and semantic frames, and it appears to account for a significant fraction of the incorrect answers from every tested model, and the vast majority of them for some models. We also validate the generalizability of this input-conflicting hallucination phenomenon with smaller-scale experiments on a type of stable matching problem. Our results indicate that RLLMs may possess broader issues with misrepresentation of problem specifics, and we offer suggestions for design choices to mitigate this weakness.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages (9 excluding references and appendices); 9 figures (6 excluding appendices)</p></details> |
| **[Bias after Prompting: Persistent Discrimination in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08146v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A dangerous assumption that can be made from prior work on the bias transfer hypothesis (BTH) is that biases do not transfer from pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to adapted models. We invalidate this assumption by studying the BTH in causal models under prompt adaptations, as prompting is an extremely popular and accessible adaptation strategy used in real-world applications. In contrast to prior work, we find that biases can transfer through prompting and that popular prompt-based mitigation methods do not consistently prevent biases from transferring. Specifically, the correlation between intrinsic biases and those after prompt adaptation remain moderate to strong across demographics and tasks -- for example, gender (rho >= 0.94) in co-reference resolution, and age (rho >= 0.98) and religion (rho >= 0.69) in question answering. Further, we find that biases remain strongly correlated when varying few-shot composition parameters, such as sample size, stereotypical content, occupational distribution and representational balance (rho >= 0.90). We evaluate several prompt-based debiasing strategies and find that different approaches have distinct strengths, but none consistently reduce bias transfer across models, tasks or demographics. These results demonstrate that correcting bias, and potentially improving reasoning ability, in intrinsic models may prevent propagation of biases to downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |

The approach combines the predictive strength of black-box models with the interpretability required for reliable decision-making. We use LLM-powered feature engineering to extract and synthesize complex signals from unstructured data, which are then processed within a layered ensemble of models including XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression. The ensemble first produces a continuous estimate of success likelihood, which is then thresholded to produce a binary rare-event prediction. We apply this framework to the domain of Venture Capital (VC), where investors must evaluate startups with limited and noisy early-stage data. The empirical results show strong performance: the model achieves precision between 9.8X and 11.1X the random classifier baseline in three independent test subsets. Feature sensitivity analysis further reveals interpretable success drivers: the startup's category list accounts for 15.6% of predictive influence, followed by the number of founders, while education level and domain expertise contribute smaller yet consistent effects.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |
| **[SCA-LLM: Spectral-Attentive Channel Prediction with Large Language Models in MIMO-OFDM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08139v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the success of large language models (LLMs) has inspired growing interest in exploring their potential applications in wireless communications, especially for channel prediction tasks. However, directly applying LLMs to channel prediction faces a domain mismatch issue stemming from their text-based pre-training. To mitigate this, the ``adapter + LLM" paradigm has emerged, where an adapter is designed to bridge the domain gap between the channel state information (CSI) data and LLMs. While showing initial success, existing adapters may not fully exploit the potential of this paradigm. To address this limitation, this work provides a key insight that learning representations from the spectral components of CSI features can more effectively help bridge the domain gap. Accordingly, we propose a spectral-attentive framework, named SCA-LLM, for channel prediction in multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems. Specifically, its novel adapter can capture finer spectral details and better adapt the LLM for channel prediction than previous methods. Extensive simulations show that SCA-LLM achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance and strong generalization, yielding up to $-2.4~\text{dB}$ normalized mean squared error (NMSE) advantage over the previous LLM based method. Ablation studies further confirm the superiority of SCA-LLM in mitigating domain mismatch.</p></details> |  |

While recent zero-shot methods leverage large language models (LLMs) to address this, they often struggle with sparse metadata and hallucinated or incomplete knowledge. We propose ColdRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation approach that builds a domain-specific knowledge graph dynamically to enhance LLM-based recommendation in cold-start scenarios, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. ColdRAG begins by converting structured item attributes into rich natural-language profiles, from which it extracts entities and relationships to construct a unified knowledge graph capturing item semantics. Given a user's interaction history, it scores edges in the graph using an LLM, retrieves candidate items with supporting evidence, and prompts the LLM to rank them. By enabling multi-hop reasoning over this graph, ColdRAG grounds recommendations in verifiable evidence, reducing hallucinations and strengthening semantic connections. Experiments on three public benchmarks demonstrate that ColdRAG surpasses existing zero-shot baselines in both Recall and NDCG. This framework offers a practical solution to cold-start recommendation by combining knowledge-graph reasoning with retrieval-augmented LLM generation.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Such loops were shown to lead to distribution shifts - models misrepresenting the true underlying distributions of human data (also called model collapse). However, how human data properties affect such shifts remains poorly understood. In this paper, we provide the first empirical examination of the effect of such properties on the outcome of recursive training. We first confirm that using different human datasets leads to distribution shifts of different magnitudes. Through exhaustive manipulation of dataset properties combined with regression analyses, we then identify a set of properties predicting distribution shift magnitudes. Lexical diversity is found to amplify these shifts, while semantic diversity and data quality mitigate them. Furthermore, we find that these influences are highly modular: data scrapped from a given internet domain has little influence on the content generated for another domain. Finally, experiments on political bias reveal that human data properties affect whether the initial bias will be amplified or reduced. Overall, our results portray a novel view, where different parts of internet may undergo different types of distribution shift.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |

Weight and activation quantization (WAQ) offers a promising solution by reducing both memory footprint and arithmetic complexity. Traditional WAQ designs rely on uniform integer quantization for hardware efficiency, but often suffer from significant model performance degradation at low precision. In contrast, K-Means quantization, a non-uniform technique, achieves higher accuracy by aligning with the Gaussian-like distributions of weights and activations in LLMs. However, two key challenges prevent the efficient deployment of K-Means-based WAQ designs for LLM inference: (1) The non-uniform structure of K-Means-quantized data precludes direct execution on low-precision compute units, necessitating dequantization and floating-point matrix multiplications (MatMuls) during inference. (2) Activation outliers hinder effective low-precision quantization. Offline thresholding methods for outlier detection degrade model performance substantially, while existing online detection techniques introduce significant runtime overhead. To address the aforementioned challenges and fully unleash the potential of K-Means-based WAQ for LLM inference, in this paper, we propose KLLM, an LLM inference accelerator for efficient execution with K-Means-quantized weights and activations. KLLM features an index-based computation scheme for efficient execution of MatMuls and nonlinear operations on K-Means-quantized data, which avoids most of the dequantization and full-precision computations. Moreover, KLLM incorporates a lightweight outlier detection engine, Orizuru, that efficiently identifies the top-$k$ largest and smallest elements in the activation data stream during online inference.</p></details> |  |

Existing encoder-plus-decoder methods such as LangBridge and MindMerger raise accuracy on mid and high-resource languages, yet they leave a large gap on LRLs. We present MERLIN, a two-stage model-stacking framework that applies a curriculum learning strategy -- from general bilingual bitext to task-specific data -- and adapts only a small set of DoRA weights. On the AfriMGSM benchmark MERLIN improves exact-match accuracy by +12.9 pp over MindMerger and outperforms GPT-4o-mini. It also yields consistent gains on MGSM and MSVAMP (+0.9 and +2.8 pp), demonstrating effectiveness across both low and high-resource settings.</p></details> | under submission |

Large language models (LLMs) are not trained for this objective, which raises the question: are LLMs capable of evolving efficient human-like semantic systems? To address this question, we focus on the domain of color as a key testbed of cognitive theories of categorization and replicate with LLMs (Gemini 2.0-flash and Llama 3.3-70B-Instruct) two influential human behavioral studies. First, we conduct an English color-naming study, showing that Gemini aligns well with the naming patterns of native English speakers and achieves a significantly high IB-efficiency score, while Llama exhibits an efficient but lower complexity system compared to English. Second, to test whether LLMs simply mimic patterns in their training data or actually exhibit a human-like inductive bias toward IB-efficiency, we simulate cultural evolution of pseudo color-naming systems in LLMs via iterated in-context language learning. We find that akin to humans, LLMs iteratively restructure initially random systems towards greater IB-efficiency and increased alignment with patterns observed across the world's languages. These findings demonstrate that LLMs are capable of evolving perceptually grounded, human-like semantic systems, driven by the same fundamental principle that governs semantic efficiency across human languages.</p></details> |  |

Although recent studies have examined the effectiveness of LLMs in recommending and suggesting refactoring, there is a limited understanding of how developers express their refactoring needs when interacting with ChatGPT. In this paper, our goal is to explore interactions related to refactoring between developers and ChatGPT to better understand how developers identify areas for improvement in code, and how ChatGPT addresses developers' needs. Our approach involves text mining 715 refactoring-related interactions from 29,778 ChatGPT prompts and responses, as well as the analysis of developers' explicit refactoring intentions.</p></details> |  |

Developers must navigate documentation, understand APIs, and write integration code, creating significant barriers to efficient software reuse. To address this, we present EnvX, a framework that leverages Agentic AI to agentize GitHub repositories, transforming them into intelligent, autonomous agents capable of natural language interaction and inter-agent collaboration. Unlike existing approaches that treat repositories as static code resources, EnvX reimagines them as active agents through a three-phase process: (1) TODO-guided environment initialization, which sets up the necessary dependencies, data, and validation datasets; (2) human-aligned agentic automation, allowing repository-specific agents to autonomously perform real-world tasks; and (3) Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol, enabling multiple agents to collaborate. By combining large language model capabilities with structured tool integration, EnvX automates not just code generation, but the entire process of understanding, initializing, and operationalizing repository functionality. We evaluate EnvX on the GitTaskBench benchmark, using 18 repositories across domains such as image processing, speech recognition, document analysis, and video manipulation. Our results show that EnvX achieves a 74.07% execution completion rate and 51.85% task pass rate, outperforming existing frameworks. Case studies further demonstrate EnvX's ability to enable multi-repository collaboration via the A2A protocol. This work marks a shift from treating repositories as passive code resources to intelligent, interactive agents, fostering greater accessibility and collaboration within the open-source ecosystem.</p></details> |  |

However, LLM personalization might also increase unintended side effects. Recent work suggests that persona prompting can lead models to falsely refuse user requests. However, no work has fully quantified the extent of this issue. To address this gap, we measure the impact of 15 sociodemographic personas (based on gender, race, religion, and disability) on false refusal. To control for other factors, we also test 16 different models, 3 tasks (Natural Language Inference, politeness, and offensiveness classification), and nine prompt paraphrases. We propose a Monte Carlo-based method to quantify this issue in a sample-efficient manner. Our results show that as models become more capable, personas impact the refusal rate less and less. Certain sociodemographic personas increase false refusal in some models, which suggests underlying biases in the alignment strategies or safety mechanisms. However, we find that the model choice and task significantly influence false refusals, especially in sensitive content tasks. Our findings suggest that persona effects have been overestimated, and might be due to other factors.</p></details> |  |

Yet, multiple recent benchmarks, such as LVBench, Neptune, and ActivityNet-RTL, show performance wanes for tasks requiring complex reasoning on videos as queries grow more complex and videos grow longer. In this work, we ask: can existing perception capabilities be leveraged to successfully perform more complex video reasoning? In particular, we develop a large language model agent given access to video modules as subagents or tools. Rather than following a fixed procedure to solve queries as in previous work such as Visual Programming, ViperGPT, and MoReVQA, the agent uses the results of each call to a module to determine subsequent steps. Inspired by work in the textual reasoning domain, we introduce a critic to distinguish between instances of successful and unsuccessful sequences from the agent. We show that the combination of our agent and critic achieve strong performance on the previously-mentioned datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, activating such capabilities through training remains challenging, as existing methods predominantly rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) over synthetic data, which encourages teacher-forced imitation rather than exploration and generalization. Different from them, we propose \textbf{Parallel-R1}, the first reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables parallel thinking behaviors for complex real-world reasoning tasks. Our framework employs a progressive curriculum that explicitly addresses the cold-start problem in training parallel thinking with RL. We first use SFT on prompt-generated trajectories from easier tasks to instill the parallel thinking ability, then transition to RL to explore and generalize this skill on harder problems. Experiments on various math benchmarks, including MATH, AMC23, and AIME, show that Parallel-R1 successfully instills parallel thinking, leading to 8.4% accuracy improvements over the sequential thinking model trained directly on challenging tasks with RL. Further analysis reveals a clear shift in the model's thinking behavior: at an early stage, it uses parallel thinking as an exploration strategy, while in a later stage, it uses the same capability for multi-perspective verification. Most significantly, we validate parallel thinking as a \textbf{mid-training exploration scaffold}, where this temporary exploratory phase unlocks a higher performance ceiling after RL, yielding a 42.9% improvement over the baseline on AIME25. Our model, data, and code will be open-source at https://github.com/zhengkid/Parallel-R1.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://zhengkid.github.io/Parallel_R1.github.io/</p></details> |

We attribute this gap to the prevailing text-only supervision paradigm, which provides only indirect guidance for the visual pathway and often leads MLLMs to discard fine-grained visual details during training. In this paper, we present VIsual Representation ALignment (VIRAL), a simple yet effective regularization strategy that aligns the internal visual representations of MLLMs with those of pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs). By explicitly enforcing this alignment, VIRAL enables the model not only to retain critical visual details from the input vision encoder but also to complement additional visual knowledge from VFMs, thereby enhancing its ability to reason over complex visual inputs. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across all tasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to validate the key design choices underlying our framework. We believe this simple finding opens up an important direction for the effective integration of visual information in training MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/VIRAL/</p></details> |

SimpleQA Verified was created through a rigorous multi-stage filtering process involving de-duplication, topic balancing, and source reconciliation to produce a more reliable and challenging evaluation set, alongside improvements in the autorater prompt. On this new benchmark, Gemini 2.5 Pro achieves a state-of-the-art F1-score of 55.6, outperforming other frontier models, including GPT-5. This work provides the research community with a higher-fidelity tool to track genuine progress in parametric model factuality and to mitigate hallucinations.

| **[Is Your LLM Overcharging You? Tokenization, Transparency, and Incentives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21627v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art large language models require specialized hardware and substantial energy to operate. As a consequence, cloud-based services that provide access to large language models have become very popular. In these services, the price users pay for an output provided by a model depends on the number of tokens the model uses to generate it -- they pay a fixed price per token. In this work, we show that this pricing mechanism creates a financial incentive for providers to strategize and misreport the (number of) tokens a model used to generate an output, and users cannot prove, or even know, whether a provider is overcharging them. However, we also show that, if an unfaithful provider is obliged to be transparent about the generative process used by the model, misreporting optimally without raising suspicion is hard. Nevertheless, as a proof-of-concept, we develop an efficient heuristic algorithm that allows providers to significantly overcharge users without raising suspicion. Crucially, we demonstrate that the cost of running the algorithm is lower than the additional revenue from overcharging users, highlighting the vulnerability of users under the current pay-per-token pricing mechanism. Further, we show that, to eliminate the financial incentive to strategize, a pricing mechanism must price tokens linearly on their character count. While this makes a provider's profit margin vary across tokens, we introduce a simple prescription under which the provider who adopts such an incentive-compatible pricing mechanism can maintain the average profit margin they had under the pay-per-token pricing mechanism. Along the way, to illustrate and complement our theoretical results, we conduct experiments with several large language models from the $\texttt{Llama}$, $\texttt{Gemma}$ and $\texttt{Ministral}$ families, and input prompts from the LMSYS Chatbot Arena platform.</p></details> |  |

However, the complexity of data structures and algorithmic logic often results in functional deficiencies and security vulnerabilities in generated code, reducing it to a prototype requiring extensive manual debugging. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can enhance correctness and security by leveraging external code manuals, it simultaneously introduces new attack surfaces. In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of attack surfaces in Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG), focusing on malicious dependency hijacking. We demonstrate how poisoned documentation containing hidden malicious dependencies (e.g., matplotlib_safe) can subvert RACG, exploiting dual trust chains: LLM reliance on RAG and developers' blind trust in LLM suggestions. To construct poisoned documents, we propose ImportSnare, a novel attack framework employing two synergistic strategies: 1)Position-aware beam search optimizes hidden ranking sequences to elevate poisoned documents in retrieval results, and 2)Multilingual inductive suggestions generate jailbreaking sequences to manipulate LLMs into recommending malicious dependencies. Through extensive experiments across Python, Rust, and JavaScript, ImportSnare achieves significant attack success rates (over 50% for popular libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn) in general, and is also able to succeed even when the poisoning ratio is as low as 0.01%, targeting both custom and real-world malicious packages. Our findings reveal critical supply chain risks in LLM-powered development, highlighting inadequate security alignment for code generation tasks. To support future research, we will release the multilingual benchmark suite and datasets.

| **[Guided Reasoning in LLM-Driven Penetration Testing Using Structured Attack Trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07939v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven interest in automating cybersecurity penetration testing workflows, offering the promise of faster and more consistent vulnerability assessment for enterprise systems. Existing LLM agents for penetration testing primarily rely on self-guided reasoning, which can produce inaccurate or hallucinated procedural steps. As a result, the LLM agent may undertake unproductive actions, such as exploiting unused software libraries or generating cyclical responses that repeat prior tactics. In this work, we propose a guided reasoning pipeline for penetration testing LLM agents that incorporates a deterministic task tree built from the MITRE ATT&CK Matrix, a proven penetration testing kll chain, to constrain the LLM's reaoning process to explicitly defined tactics, techniques, and procedures. This anchors reasoning in proven penetration testing methodologies and filters out ineffective actions by guiding the agent towards more productive attack procedures. To evaluate our approach, we built an automated penetration testing LLM agent using three LLMs (Llama-3-8B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4) and applied it to navigate 10 HackTheBox cybersecurity exercises with 103 discrete subtasks representing real-world cyberattack scenarios. Our proposed reasoning pipeline guided the LLM agent through 71.8\%, 72.8\%, and 78.6\% of subtasks using Llama-3-8B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4, respectively. Comparatively, the state-of-the-art LLM penetration testing tool using self-guided reasoning completed only 13.5\%, 16.5\%, and 75.7\% of subtasks and required 86.2\%, 118.7\%, and 205.9\% more model queries. This suggests that incorporating a deterministic task tree into LLM reasoning pipelines can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of automated cybersecurity assessments</p></details> |  |

This study explores Android penetration testing automation using LLM-based tools, especially PentestGPT, to identify and execute rooting techniques. Through a comparison of the traditional manual rooting process and exploitation methods produced using AI, this study evaluates the efficacy, reliability, and scalability of automated penetration testing in achieving high-level privilege access on Android devices. With the use of an Android emulator (Genymotion) as the testbed, we fully execute both traditional and exploit-based rooting methods, automating the process using AI-generated scripts. Secondly, we create a web application by integrating OpenAI's API to facilitate automated script generation from LLM-processed responses. The research focuses on the effectiveness of AI-enabled exploitation by comparing automated and manual penetration testing protocols, by determining LLM weaknesses and strengths along the way. We also provide security suggestions of AI-enabled exploitation, including ethical factors and potential misuse. The findings exhibit that while LLMs can significantly streamline the workflow of exploitation, they need to be controlled by humans to ensure accuracy and ethical application. This study adds to the increasing body of literature on AI-powered cybersecurity and its effect on ethical hacking, security research, and mobile device security.</p></details> |  |

Researchers have explored methods for automatically generating counterspeech to health misinformation as a mitigation strategy. Existing approaches often produce uniform responses, ignoring that the health literacy level of the audience could affect the accessibility and effectiveness of counterspeech. We propose a Controlled-Literacy framework using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with reinforcement learning (RL) to generate tailored counterspeech adapted to different health literacy levels. In particular, we retrieve knowledge aligned with specific health literacy levels, enabling accessible and factual information to support generation. We design a reward function incorporating subjective user preferences and objective readability-based rewards to optimize counterspeech to the target health literacy level. Experiment results show that Controlled-Literacy outperforms baselines by generating more accessible and user-preferred counterspeech. This research contributes to more equitable and impactful public health communication by improving the accessibility and comprehension of counterspeech to health misinformation</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Findings of EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we explore how large language models (LLMs) can be used for information retrieval (IR), and an ensemble of zero-shot models can accomplish state-of-the-art performance on a domain-specific Yes/No QA task. Evaluating our approach on the BioASQ challenge tasks, we show that ensembles can outperform individual LLMs and in some cases rival or surpass domain-tuned systems - all while preserving generalizability and avoiding the need for costly fine-tuning or labeled data. Our method aggregates outputs from multiple LLM variants, including models from Anthropic and Google, to synthesize more accurate and robust answers. Moreover, our investigation highlights a relationship between context length and performance: while expanded contexts are meant to provide valuable evidence, they simultaneously risk information dilution and model disorientation. These findings emphasize IR as a critical foundation in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches for biomedical QA systems. Precise, focused retrieval remains essential for ensuring LLMs operate within relevant information boundaries when generating answers from retrieved documents. Our results establish that ensemble-based zero-shot approaches, when paired with effective RAG pipelines, constitute a practical and scalable alternative to domain-tuned systems for biomedical question answering.</p></details> | CEUR-WS, CLEF2025 |

This capability is especially critical in the legal domain. In this work, we introduce a novel end-to-end RAG pipeline that improves upon previous baselines using three targeted enhancements: (i) a context-aware query translator that disentangles document references from natural-language questions and adapts retrieval depth and response style based on expertise and specificity, (ii) open-source retrieval strategies using SBERT and GTE embeddings that achieve substantial performance gains while remaining cost-efficient, and (iii) a comprehensive evaluation and generation framework that combines RAGAS, BERTScore-F1, and ROUGE-Recall to assess semantic alignment and faithfulness across models and prompt designs. Our results show that carefully designed open-source pipelines can rival proprietary approaches in retrieval quality, while a custom legal-grounded prompt consistently produces more faithful and contextually relevant answers than baseline prompting. Taken together, these contributions demonstrate the potential of task-aware, component-level tuning to deliver legally grounded, reproducible, and cost-effective RAG systems for legal research assistance.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to NLLP 2025 Workshop</p></details> |

Yet, no prior work has explored knowledge base question answering over visual document images with queries provided directly in speech. We propose TextlessRAG, the first end-to-end framework for speech-based question answering over large-scale document images. Unlike prior methods, TextlessRAG eliminates ASR, TTS and OCR, directly interpreting speech, retrieving relevant visual knowledge, and generating answers in a fully textless pipeline. To further boost performance, we integrate a layout-aware reranking mechanism to refine retrieval. Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in both efficiency and accuracy. To advance research in this direction, we also release the first bilingual speech--document RAG dataset, featuring Chinese and English voice queries paired with multimodal document content. Both the dataset and our pipeline will be made available at repository:https://github.com/xiepeijinhit-hue/textlessrag</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures, |
| **[CyberRAG: An Agentic RAG cyber attack classification and reporting tool](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02424v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) in large enterprises can generate hundreds of thousands of alerts per hour, overwhelming analysts with logs requiring rapidly evolving expertise. Conventional machine-learning detectors reduce alert volume but still yield many false positives, while standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines often retrieve irrelevant context and fail to justify predictions. We present CyberRAG, a modular agent-based RAG framework that delivers real-time classification, explanation, and structured reporting for cyber-attacks. A central LLM agent orchestrates: (i) fine-tuned classifiers specialized by attack family; (ii) tool adapters for enrichment and alerting; and (iii) an iterative retrieval-and-reason loop that queries a domain-specific knowledge base until evidence is relevant and self-consistent. Unlike traditional RAG, CyberRAG adopts an agentic design that enables dynamic control flow and adaptive reasoning. This architecture autonomously refines threat labels and natural-language justifications, reducing false positives and enhancing interpretability. It is also extensible: new attack types can be supported by adding classifiers without retraining the core agent. CyberRAG was evaluated on SQL Injection, XSS, and SSTI, achieving over 94\% accuracy per class and a final classification accuracy of 94.92\% through semantic orchestration. Generated explanations reached 0.94 in BERTScore and 4.9/5 in GPT-4-based expert evaluation, with robustness preserved against adversarial and unseen payloads. These results show that agentic, specialist-oriented RAG can combine high detection accuracy with trustworthy, SOC-ready prose, offering a flexible path toward partially automated cyber-defense workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Iterative LLM Framework for SIBT utilizing RAG-based Adaptive Weight Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08407v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Seed implant brachytherapy (SIBT) is an effective cancer treatment modality; however, clinical planning often relies on manual adjustment of objective function weights, leading to inefficiencies and suboptimal results. This study proposes an adaptive weight optimization framework for SIBT planning, driven by large language models (LLMs). A locally deployed DeepSeek-R1 LLM is integrated with an automatic planning algorithm in an iterative loop. Starting with fixed weights, the LLM evaluates plan quality and recommends new weights in the next iteration. This process continues until convergence criteria are met, after which the LLM conducts a comprehensive evaluation to identify the optimal plan. A clinical knowledge base, constructed and queried via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), enhances the model's domain-specific reasoning. The proposed method was validated on 23 patient cases, showing that the LLM-assisted approach produces plans that are comparable to or exceeding clinically approved and fixed-weight plans, in terms of dose homogeneity for the clinical target volume (CTV) and sparing of organs at risk (OARs). The study demonstrates the potential use of LLMs in SIBT planning automation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aligning LLMs for the Classroom with Knowledge-Based Retrieval -- A Comparative RAG Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07846v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models like ChatGPT are increasingly used in classrooms, but they often provide outdated or fabricated information that can mislead students. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) improves reliability of LLMs by grounding responses in external resources. We investigate two accessible RAG paradigms, vector-based retrieval and graph-based retrieval to identify best practices for classroom question answering (QA). Existing comparative studies fail to account for pedagogical factors such as educational disciplines, question types, and practical deployment costs. Using a novel dataset, EduScopeQA, of 3,176 questions across academic subjects, we measure performance on various educational query types, from specific facts to broad thematic discussions. We also evaluate system alignment with a dataset of systematically altered textbooks that contradict the LLM's latent knowledge. We find that OpenAI Vector Search RAG (representing vector-based RAG) performs well as a low-cost generalist, especially for quick fact retrieval. On the other hand, GraphRAG Global excels at providing pedagogically rich answers to thematic queries, and GraphRAG Local achieves the highest accuracy with the dense, altered textbooks when corpus integrity is critical. Accounting for the 10-20x higher resource usage of GraphRAG (representing graph-based RAG), we show that a dynamic branching framework that routes queries to the optimal retrieval method boosts fidelity and efficiency. These insights provide actionable guidelines for educators and system designers to integrate RAG-augmented LLMs into learning environments effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

However, most existing RAG research in finance focuses predominantly on textual data, overlooking the rich visual content in financial documents, resulting in the loss of key analytical insights. To bridge this gap, we present FinRAGBench-V, a comprehensive visual RAG benchmark tailored for finance which effectively integrates multimodal data and provides visual citation to ensure traceability. It includes a bilingual retrieval corpus with 60,780 Chinese and 51,219 English pages, along with a high-quality, human-annotated question-answering (QA) dataset spanning heterogeneous data types and seven question categories. Moreover, we introduce RGenCite, an RAG baseline that seamlessly integrates visual citation with generation. Furthermore, we propose an automatic citation evaluation method to systematically assess the visual citation capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Extensive experiments on RGenCite underscore the challenging nature of FinRAGBench-V, providing valuable insights for the development of multimodal RAG systems in finance.</p></details> |  |

Existing coarse-ranking optimization approaches often struggle to balance domain-specific knowledge learning with query enhencement, resulting in suboptimal retrieval performance. To address this challenge, we propose MoLER, a domain-aware RAG method that uses MoL-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning to optimize retrieval. MoLER has a two-stage pipeline: a continual pre-training (CPT) phase using a Mixture of Losses (MoL) to balance domain-specific knowledge with general language capabilities, and a reinforcement learning (RL) phase leveraging Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to optimize query and passage generation for maximizing document recall. A key innovation is our Multi-query Single-passage Late Fusion (MSLF) strategy, which reduces computational overhead during RL training while maintaining scalable inference via Multi-query Multi-passage Late Fusion (MMLF). Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that MoLER achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming baseline methods. MoLER bridges the knowledge gap in RAG systems, enabling robust and scalable retrieval in specialized domains.</p></details> |  |

However, LLMs often fail to faithfully integrate retrieved evidence into their generated responses, leading to factual inconsistencies. To quantify this gap, we introduce Entity-Context Divergence (ECD), a metric that measures the extent to which retrieved information is accurately reflected in model outputs. We systematically evaluate contemporary LLMs on their ability to preserve factual consistency in retrieval-augmented settings, a capability we define as RAG-ability. Our empirical analysis reveals that RAG-ability remains low across most LLMs, highlighting significant challenges in entity retention and context fidelity. This paper introduces Radiant (Retrieval AugmenteD entIty-context AligNmenT), a novel framework that merges RAG with alignment designed to optimize the interplay between retrieved evidence and generated content. Radiant extends Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to teach LLMs how to integrate provided additional information into subsequent generations. As a behavior correction mechanism, Radiant boosts RAG performance across varied retrieval scenarios, such as noisy web contexts, knowledge conflicts, and hallucination reduction. This enables more reliable, contextually grounded, and factually coherent content generation.</p></details> |  |

Addressing the shortcomings of conventional health search engines and the lag in public access to biomedical research, the system integrates diverse sources, including PubMed articles, curated Q&A datasets, and medical encyclopedias ,to retrieve relevant information and generate concise, context-aware responses. The retrieval pipeline uses MiniLM-based semantic embeddings and FAISS vector search, while answer generation is performed by a fine-tuned Mistral-7B-v0.3 language model optimized using QLoRA for efficient, low-resource training. The system supports both general medical queries and domain-specific tasks, with a focused evaluation on breast cancer literature demonstrating the value of domain-aligned retrieval. Empirical results, measured using BERTScore (F1), show substantial improvements in factual consistency and semantic relevance compared to baseline models. The findings underscore the potential of RAG-enhanced language models to bridge the gap between complex biomedical literature and accessible public health knowledge, paving the way for future work on multilingual adaptation, privacy-preserving inference, and personalized medical AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Graph RAG as Human Choice Model: Building a Data-Driven Mobility Agent with Preference Chain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16172v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding human behavior in urban environments is a crucial field within city sciences. However, collecting accurate behavioral data, particularly in newly developed areas, poses significant challenges. Recent advances in generative agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), have shown promise in simulating human behaviors without relying on extensive datasets. Nevertheless, these methods often struggle with generating consistent, context-sensitive, and realistic behavioral outputs. To address these limitations, this paper introduces the Preference Chain, a novel method that integrates Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LLMs to enhance context-aware simulation of human behavior in transportation systems. Experiments conducted on the Replica dataset demonstrate that the Preference Chain outperforms standard LLM in aligning with real-world transportation mode choices. The development of the Mobility Agent highlights potential applications of proposed method in urban mobility modeling for emerging cities, personalized travel behavior analysis, and dynamic traffic forecasting. Despite limitations such as slow inference and the risk of hallucination, the method offers a promising framework for simulating complex human behavior in data-scarce environments, where traditional data-driven models struggle due to limited data availability.</p></details> |  |

Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization for Preserving Agentic RAG Capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20324v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a post-training approach to elicit agentic RAG behaviors such as search and planning from language models. However, compact language models (e.g., 0.5B parameters) struggle due to poor reasoning ability, resulting in sparse rewards and unstable training. To overcome these difficulties, we propose Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization (DGPO), which addresses the challenges through cold-start initialization from teacher demonstrations and continuous teacher guidance during policy optimization. To systematically evaluate our approach, we introduce Agentic RAG Capabilities (ARC), a fine-grained metric analyzing reasoning, search coordination, and response synthesis. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that DGPO enables compact models to achieve sophisticated agentic search behaviors, even outperforming the larger teacher model in some cases. DGPO makes agentic RAG feasible in computing resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  |

Our approach addresses the challenges of understanding and retrieving complex technical content by leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). First, we enhance user queries by generating expanded representations that better capture user intent and improve dataset diversity, thereby enriching the fine-tuning process for embedding models. Second, we apply summary extraction techniques to encode essential contextual information, refining the representation of technical documents. To further enhance retrieval performance, we fine-tune a bi-encoder BERT model using soft prompting, incorporating separate learning parameters for queries and document context to capture fine-grained semantic nuances. We evaluate our approach on two public datasets, RAG-EDA and Rust-Docs-QA, demonstrating that Technical-Embeddings significantly outperforms baseline models in both precision and recall. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating query expansion and contextual summarization to enhance information access and comprehension in technical domains. This work advances the state of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, offering new avenues for efficient and accurate technical document retrieval in engineering and product development workflows.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves accuracy by grounding outputs in external knowledge, especially in domains like healthcare, where precision is vital. However, RAG remains opaque and essentially a black box, heavily dependent on data quality. We developed a method-agnostic, perturbation-based framework that provides token and component-level interoperability for Graph RAG using SMILE and named it as Knowledge-Graph (KG)-SMILE. By applying controlled perturbations, computing similarities, and training weighted linear surrogates, KG-SMILE identifies the graph entities and relations most influential to generated outputs, thereby making RAG more transparent. We evaluate KG-SMILE using comprehensive attribution metrics, including fidelity, faithfulness, consistency, stability, and accuracy. Our findings show that KG-SMILE produces stable, human-aligned explanations, demonstrating its capacity to balance model effectiveness with interpretability and thereby fostering greater transparency and trust in machine learning technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Iterative RAG for Knowledge Visual Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00798v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced multimodal understanding, their performance remains limited on knowledge-intensive visual questions that require external knowledge beyond the image. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a promising solution for providing models with external knowledge, its conventional single-pass framework often fails to gather sufficient knowledge. To overcome this limitation, we propose MI-RAG, a Multimodal Iterative RAG framework that leverages reasoning to enhance retrieval and update reasoning over newly retrieved knowledge across modalities. At each iteration, MI-RAG leverages an accumulated reasoning record to dynamically formulate a multi-query. These queries then drive a joint search across heterogeneous knowledge bases containing both visually-grounded and textual knowledge. The newly acquired knowledge is synthesized into the reasoning record, progressively refining understanding across iterations. Experiments on challenging benchmarks, including Encyclopedic VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA, show that MI-RAG significantly improves both retrieval recall and answer accuracy, establishing a scalable approach for compositional reasoning in knowledge-intensive VQA.</p></details> |  |

However, effectively combining evidence from these heterogeneous sources is challenging as the respective similarity scores are not inter-comparable. Additionally, aggregating beliefs from the outputs of multiple rankers can improve the effectiveness of RAG. Our proposed method first aggregates the top-documents from a number of IR models using a standard rank fusion technique for each source (labeled and unlabeled). Next, we standardize the retrieval score distributions within each source by applying z-score transformation before merging the top-retrieved documents from the two sources. We evaluate our approach on the fact verification task, demonstrating that it consistently improves over the best-performing individual ranker or source and also shows better out-of-domain generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[VaccineRAG: Boosting Multimodal Large Language Models' Immunity to Harmful RAG Samples](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04502v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances the response accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating retrieval and generation modules with external knowledge, demonstrating particular strength in real-time queries and Visual Question Answering tasks. However, the effectiveness of RAG is frequently hindered by the precision of the retriever: many retrieved samples fed into the generation phase are irrelevant or misleading, posing a critical bottleneck to LLMs' performance. To address this challenge, we introduce VaccineRAG, a novel Chain-of-Thought-based retrieval-augmented generation dataset. On one hand, VaccineRAG employs a benchmark to evaluate models using data with varying positive/negative sample ratios, systematically exposing inherent weaknesses in current LLMs. On the other hand, it enhances models' sample-discrimination capabilities by prompting LLMs to generate explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) analysis for each sample before producing final answers. Furthermore, to enhance the model's ability to learn long-sequence complex CoT content, we propose Partial-GRPO. By modeling the outputs of LLMs as multiple components rather than a single whole, our model can make more informed preference selections for complex sequences, thereby enhancing its capacity to learn complex CoT. Comprehensive evaluations and ablation studies on VaccineRAG validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The code and dataset will be publicly released soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[FinS-Pilot: A Benchmark for Online Financial RAG System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02037v2)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various professional domains, with their performance typically evaluated through standardized benchmarks. In the financial field, the stringent demands for professional accuracy and real-time data processing often necessitate the use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques. However, the development of financial RAG benchmarks has been constrained by data confidentiality issues and the lack of dynamic data integration. To address this issue, we introduce FinS-Pilot, a novel benchmark for evaluating RAG systems in online financial applications. Constructed from real-world financial assistant interactions, our benchmark incorporates both real-time API data and text data, organized through an intent classification framework covering critical financial domains. The benchmark enables comprehensive evaluation of financial assistants' capabilities in handling both static knowledge and time-sensitive market information.Through systematic experiments with multiple Chinese leading LLMs, we demonstrate FinS-Pilot's effectiveness in identifying models suitable for financial applications while addressing the current gap in specialized evaluation tools for the financial domain. Our work contributes both a practical evaluation framework and a curated dataset to advance research in financial NLP systems. The code and dataset are accessible on GitHub.</p></details> |  |
| **[REFRAG: Rethinking RAG based Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01092v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in leveraging extensive external knowledge to enhance responses in multi-turn and agentic applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, processing long-context inputs introduces significant system latency and demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced throughput and a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system efficiency. While minimizing latency for long-context inputs is a primary objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG require specialized consideration. In RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated passages from retrieval, with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages often exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during re-ranking, leading to block-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those in standard LLM generation tasks. Based on this observation, we argue that most computations over the RAG context during decoding are unnecessary and can be eliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose REFRAG, an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve latency in RAG applications. By exploiting the sparsity structure, we demonstrate a 30.85 the time-to-first-token acceleration (3.75 improvement to previous work) without loss in perplexity. In addition, our optimization framework for large context enables REFRAG to extend the context size of LLMs by 16. We provide rigorous validation of REFRAG across diverse long-context tasks, including RAG, multi-turn conversations, and long document summarization, spanning a wide range of datasets. Experimental results confirm that REFRAG delivers substantial speedup with no loss in accuracy compared to LLaMA models and other state-of-the-art baselines across various context sizes.</p></details> |  |
| **[EviNote-RAG: Enhancing RAG Models via Answer-Supportive Evidence Notes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00877v1)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) empowered with retrieval mechanisms have achieved strong progress in open-domain question answering (QA). Yet, the conventional retrieve--then--answer paradigm often suffers from two key limitations: (1) low signal-to-noise ratio in retrieved evidence, where useful information is buried under irrelevant content, and (2) error accumulation in multi-hop reasoning when incomplete or noisy passages are involved. To address these challenges, we present EviNote-RAG, an agentic RAG framework that introduces a structured retrieve--note--answer pipeline. Instead of directly reasoning over raw retrievals, the model is trained to compose Supportive-Evidence Notes (SENs), concise, human-like notes that preserve only answer-relevant information, highlight uncertainty, and explicitly state when no useful evidence exists. This distillation process is further reinforced by the Evidence Quality Reward (EQR), an entailment-based signal that evaluates whether SENs logically support the final answer. Together, SENs and EQR guide the model toward faithful and robust reasoning, while reducing the impact of noise. Experiments on in-domain and out-of-domain QA benchmarks show that EviNote-RAG consistently outperforms strong baselines in accuracy, generalization, and training stability. In particular, it achieves state-of-the-art results while enhancing robustness and efficiency, yielding relative F1 gains of 20\% on HotpotQA (+0.093), 40\% on Bamboogle (+0.151), and 91\% on 2Wiki (+0.256) via denser rewards and reduced verbosity.</p></details> |  |

As an essential part of RAG, external knowledge bases are commonly built by extracting structured data from unstructured PDF documents using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However, given the imperfect prediction of OCR and the inherent non-uniform representation of structured data, knowledge bases inevitably contain various OCR noises. In this paper, we introduce OHRBench, the first benchmark for understanding the cascading impact of OCR on RAG systems. OHRBench includes 8,561 carefully selected unstructured document images from seven real-world RAG application domains, along with 8,498 Q&A pairs derived from multimodal elements in documents, challenging existing OCR solutions used for RAG. To better understand OCR's impact on RAG systems, we identify two primary types of OCR noise: Semantic Noise and Formatting Noise and apply perturbation to generate a set of structured data with varying degrees of each OCR noise. Using OHRBench, we first conduct a comprehensive evaluation of current OCR solutions and reveal that none is competent for constructing high-quality knowledge bases for RAG systems. We then systematically evaluate the impact of these two noise types and demonstrate the trend relationship between the degree of OCR noise and RAG performance. Our OHRBench, including PDF documents, Q&As, and the ground truth structured data are released at: https://github.com/opendatalab/OHR-Bench</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Empirical Insights into Reasoning under Incomplete Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08344v2)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) is an increasingly explored approach for combining the reasoning capabilities of large language models with the structured evidence of knowledge graphs. However, current evaluation practices fall short: existing benchmarks often include questions that can be directly answered using existing triples in KG, making it unclear whether models perform reasoning or simply retrieve answers directly. Moreover, inconsistent evaluation metrics and lenient answer matching criteria further obscure meaningful comparisons. In this work, we introduce a general method for constructing benchmarks, together with an evaluation protocol, to systematically assess KG-RAG methods under knowledge incompleteness. Our empirical results show that current KG-RAG methods have limited reasoning ability under missing knowledge, often rely on internal memorization, and exhibit varying degrees of generalization depending on their design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Context Compression for Efficient RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22931v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge but incurs significant inference costs due to lengthy retrieved contexts. While context compression mitigates this issue, existing methods apply fixed compression rates, over-compressing simple queries or under-compressing complex ones. We propose Adaptive Context Compression for RAG (ACC-RAG), a framework that dynamically adjusts compression rates based on input complexity, optimizing inference efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. ACC-RAG combines a hierarchical compressor (for multi-granular embeddings) with a context selector to retain minimal sufficient information, akin to human skimming. Evaluated on Wikipedia and five QA datasets, ACC-RAG outperforms fixed-rate methods and matches/unlocks over 4 times faster inference versus standard RAG while maintaining or improving accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[MODE: Mixture of Document Experts for RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00100v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) often relies on large vector databases and cross-encoders tuned for large-scale corpora, which can be excessive for small, domain-specific collections. We present MODE (Mixture of Document Experts), a lightweight alternative that replaces fine-grained nearest-neighbor search with cluster-and-route retrieval. Documents are embedded, grouped into semantically coherent clusters, and represented by cached centroids. At query time, we route to the top centroid(s) and retrieve context only within those clusters, eliminating external vector-database infrastructure and reranking while keeping latency low. On HotpotQA and SQuAD corpora with 100-500 chunks, MODE matches or exceeds a dense-retrieval baseline in answer quality while reducing end-to-end retrieval time. Ablations show that cluster granularity and multi-cluster routing control the recall/precision trade-off, and that tighter clusters improve downstream accuracy. MODE offers a practical recipe for small and medium corpora where simplicity, speed, and topical focus matter.</p></details> |  |

In response, we developed a mental health support chatbot designed to augment professional healthcare, with a strong emphasis on safe and meaningful application. Our approach involved rigorous evaluation, covering accuracy, empathy, trustworthiness, privacy, and bias. We employed a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework, integrated prompt engineering, and fine-tuned a pre-trained model on novel datasets. The resulting system, Mentalic Net Conversational AI, achieved a BERT Score of 0.898, with other evaluation metrics falling within satisfactory ranges.

This paper introduces an ontology-driven Graph RAG framework designed to overcome these limitations. We ground our knowledge graph in a formal, LRMoo-inspired model that distinguishes abstract legal Works from their versioned Expressions. We model temporal states as efficient aggregations that reuse the versioned expressions (CTVs) of unchanged components, and we reify legislative events as first-class Action nodes to make causality explicit and queryable. This structured backbone enables a unified, planner-guided query strategy that applies explicit policies to deterministically resolve complex requests for (i) point-in-time retrieval, (ii) hierarchical impact analysis, and (iii) auditable provenance reconstruction. Through a case study on the Brazilian Constitution, we demonstrate how this approach provides a verifiable, temporally-correct substrate for LLMs, enabling higher-order analytical capabilities while drastically reducing the risk of factual errors. The result is a practical framework for building more trustworthy and explainable legal AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a major revision that significantly expands and deepens the original manuscript.

However, the effectiveness and trustworthiness of these systems critically depends on how they are evaluated, particularly on whether the evaluation process captures real-world constraints like protecting sensitive information. While current evaluation efforts for RAG systems have primarily focused on the development of performance metrics, far less attention has been given to the design and quality of the underlying evaluation datasets, despite their pivotal role in enabling meaningful, reliable assessments. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-agent framework for generating synthetic QA datasets for RAG evaluation that prioritize semantic diversity and privacy preservation. Our approach involves: (1) a Diversity agent leveraging clustering techniques to maximize topical coverage and semantic variability, (2) a Privacy Agent that detects and mask sensitive information across multiple domains and (3) a QA curation agent that synthesizes private and diverse QA pairs suitable as ground truth for RAG evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our evaluation sets outperform baseline methods in diversity and achieve robust privacy masking on domain-specific datasets. This work offers a practical and ethically aligned pathway toward safer, more comprehensive RAG system evaluation, laying the foundation for future enhancements aligned with evolving AI regulations and compliance standards.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECAI ...</summary><p>ECAI 2025 TRUST AI workshop</p></details> |

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) indexing methods aim to address this challenge by selectively retrieving only necessary document segments. However, narrative texts possess unique characteristics that limit the effectiveness of these existing approaches. Specifically, understanding narrative texts requires more than isolated segments, as the broader context and sequential relationships between segments are crucial for comprehension. To address these limitations, we propose ChronoRAG, a novel RAG framework specialized for narrative texts. This approach focuses on two essential aspects: refining dispersed document information into coherent and structured passages, and preserving narrative flow by explicitly capturing and maintaining the temporal order among retrieved passages. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of ChronoRAG through experiments on the NarrativeQA dataset, showing substantial improvements in tasks requiring both factual identification and comprehension of complex sequential relationships, underscoring that reasoning over temporal order is crucial in resolving narrative QA.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

However, co-locating the vector retriever and the LLM on shared GPU infrastructure introduces significant challenges: vector search is memory and I/O intensive, while LLM inference demands high throughput and low latency. Naive resource sharing often leads to severe performance degradation, particularly under high request load or large index sizes. We present VectorLiteRAG, a deployment-friendly RAG system that achieves latency-compliant inference without requiring additional hardware resources. VectorLiteRAG introduces a fine-grained GPU resource allocation mechanism based on detailed performance modeling and access pattern analysis. By estimating search latency and query hit rate distributions, it identifies an optimal index partitioning point across CPU and GPU tiers to minimize contention and maximize throughput. Our evaluations show that VectorLiteRAG consistently expands the SLO compliant request rate range across all tested configurations, including both small and large LLMs, and small and large vector databases compared to naive baselines and state of the art alternatives. In the best case, VectorLiteRAG improves the attainable SLO throughput by up to 1.5 times without compromising generation quality or requiring additional compute resources.</p></details> |  |

Our benchmark is built on a user manual for an agricultural machine, available in English, French, and German. It simulates a cross-lingual information retrieval scenario where questions are posed in English against all three language versions of the manual. The evaluation focuses on realistic "needle-in-a-haystack" challenges and includes unanswerable questions to test for hallucinations. We compare nine long-context LLMs using direct prompting against three Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategies (keyword, semantic, hybrid), with an LLM-as-a-judge for evaluation. Our findings for this specific manual show that Hybrid RAG consistently outperforms direct long-context prompting. Models like Gemini 2.5 Flash and the smaller Qwen 2.5 7B achieve high accuracy (over 85%) across all languages with RAG. This paper contributes a detailed analysis of LLM performance in a specialized industrial domain and an open framework for similar evaluations, highlighting practical trade-offs and challenges.</p></details> |  |

On the first level of analytics, the fine-tuned model generates graph and text summaries with sentiment scores as well as JSON representations of summaries. Higher levels perform hierarchical stacking that consolidates sets of graph-based and text-based summaries as well as summaries of summaries into comprehensive reports. The combination of graph and text summaries provides complementary views of cryptocurrency news. The model is fine-tuned with 4-bit quantization using the PEFT/LoRA approach. The representation of cryptocurrency news as knowledge graph can essentially eliminate problems with large language model hallucinations. The obtained results demonstrate that the use of fine-tuned Mistral 7B LLM models for multilevel cryptocurrency news analysis can conduct informative qualitative and quantitative analytics, providing important insights.</p></details> |  |

Learned query optimizers (LQOs) can improve performance over time by incorporating feedback; however, they suffer from cold-start issues and often require retraining when workloads shift or schemas change. Recent LLM-based query optimizers leverage pre-trained and fine-tuned LLMs to mitigate these challenges. Nevertheless, they neglect LLMs' in-context learning and execution records as feedback for continuous evolution. In this paper, we present SEFRQO, a Self-Evolving Fine-tuned RAG-based Query Optimizer. SEFRQO mitigates the cold-start problem of LQOs by continuously learning from execution feedback via a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. We employ both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement fine-tuning to prepare the LLM to produce syntactically correct and performance-efficient query hints. Moreover, SEFRQO leverages the LLM's in-context learning capabilities by dynamically constructing prompts with references to similar queries and the historical execution record of the same query. This self-evolving paradigm iteratively optimizes the prompt to minimize query execution latency. Evaluations show that SEFRQO outperforms state-of-the-art LQOs, achieving up to 65.05% and 93.57% reductions in query latency on the CEB and Stack workloads, respectively, compared to PostgreSQL.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at SIGMOD 2026 (https://2026.sigmod.org/)</p></details> |

Despite its widespread use, most RAG pipelines continue to treat retrieval and reasoning as isolated components, retrieving documents once and then generating answers without further interaction. This static design often limits performance on complex tasks that require iterative evidence gathering or high-precision retrieval. Recent work in both the information retrieval (IR) and NLP communities has begun to close this gap by introducing adaptive retrieval and ranking methods that incorporate feedback. In this survey, we present a structured overview of advanced retrieval and ranking mechanisms that integrate such feedback. We categorize feedback signals based on their source and role in improving the query, retrieved context, or document pool. By consolidating these developments, we aim to bridge IR and NLP perspectives and highlight retrieval as a dynamic, learnable component of end-to-end RAG systems.</p></details> | 18 pages, 1 figure |

Simulating Vulnerabilities, and Threats in Multimodal Medical RAG System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17215v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) augmented with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) are increasingly employed in medical AI to enhance factual grounding through external clinical image-text retrieval. However, this reliance creates a significant attack surface. We propose MedThreatRAG, a novel multimodal poisoning framework that systematically probes vulnerabilities in medical RAG systems by injecting adversarial image-text pairs. A key innovation of our approach is the construction of a simulated semi-open attack environment, mimicking real-world medical systems that permit periodic knowledge base updates via user or pipeline contributions. Within this setting, we introduce and emphasize Cross-Modal Conflict Injection (CMCI), which embeds subtle semantic contradictions between medical images and their paired reports. These mismatches degrade retrieval and generation by disrupting cross-modal alignment while remaining sufficiently plausible to evade conventional filters. While basic textual and visual attacks are included for completeness, CMCI demonstrates the most severe degradation. Evaluations on IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR QA tasks show that MedThreatRAG reduces answer F1 scores by up to 27.66% and lowers LLaVA-Med-1.5 F1 rates to as low as 51.36%. Our findings expose fundamental security gaps in clinical RAG systems and highlight the urgent need for threat-aware design and robust multimodal consistency checks. Finally, we conclude with a concise set of guidelines to inform the safe development of future multimodal medical RAG systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sumbi...</summary><p>Sumbitted to 2025 AAAI main track</p></details> |

While RDF/OWL reasoners enable graph-based reasoning, they are limited to fragments of first-order logic, preventing deeper temporal and semantic analysis. This paper addresses both challenges by developing automatic historical event extraction models using multiple LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Llama 3.2) with three enhancement strategies: pure base generation, knowledge graph enhancement, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). We conducted comprehensive evaluations using historical texts from Thucydides. Our findings reveal that enhancement strategies optimize different performance dimensions rather than providing universal improvements. For coverage and historical breadth, base generation achieves optimal performance with Claude and GPT-4 extracting comprehensive events. However, for precision, RAG enhancement improves coordinate accuracy and metadata completeness. Model architecture fundamentally determines enhancement sensitivity: larger models demonstrate robust baseline performance with incremental RAG improvements, while Llama 3.2 shows extreme variance from competitive performance to complete failure. We then developed an automated translation pipeline converting extracted RDF representations into Coq proof assistant specifications, enabling higher-order reasoning beyond RDF capabilities including multi-step causal verification, temporal arithmetic with BC dates, and formal proofs about historical causation. The Coq formalization validates that RAG-discovered event types represent legitimate domain-specific semantic structures rather than ontological violations.</p></details> |  |

These benchmarks overlook key factors such as the interaction between retrieval difficulty and reasoning depth. To address this gap, we propose \textsc{GRADE}, a novel evaluation framework that models task difficulty along two orthogonal dimensions: (1) reasoning depth, defined by the number of inference steps (hops), and (2) semantic distance between the query and its supporting evidence. We construct a synthetic multi-hop QA dataset from factual news articles by extracting knowledge graphs and augmenting them through semantic clustering to recover missing links, allowing us to generate diverse and difficulty-controlled queries. Central to our framework is a 2D difficulty matrix that combines generator-side and retriever-side difficulty. Experiments across multiple domains and models show that error rates strongly correlate with our difficulty measures, validating their diagnostic utility. \textsc{GRADE} enables fine-grained analysis of RAG performance and provides a scalable foundation for evaluating and improving multi-hop reasoning in real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 findings</p></details> |

Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help, but their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor feedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce Deep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for medical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical retrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge sources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More crutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its environment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure, and diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from large-scale data through RL. Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches across multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic baselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks for both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and retrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the uniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional implementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight improvements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight into its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more reliable and precise preliminary diagnoses.

Existing approaches often rely on heavy training and large computational resources. While foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) offer strong generalization, they still struggle to handle COD tasks without fine-tuning and require high-quality prompts to yield good performance. However, generating such prompts manually is costly and inefficient. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{First RAG, Second SEG (RAG-SEG)}, a training-free paradigm that decouples COD into two stages: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for generating coarse masks as prompts, followed by SAM-based segmentation (SEG) for refinement. RAG-SEG constructs a compact retrieval database via unsupervised clustering, enabling fast and effective feature retrieval. During inference, the retrieved features produce pseudo-labels that guide precise mask generation using SAM2. Our method eliminates the need for conventional training while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark COD datasets demonstrate that RAG-SEG performs on par with or surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Notably, all experiments are conducted on a \textbf{personal laptop}, highlighting the computational efficiency and practicality of our approach. We present further analysis in the Appendix, covering limitations, salient object detection extension, and possible improvements.</p></details> |  |

Within the ORAN architecture, Large Language Models (LLMs) can be specialized to generate xApps and rApps by leveraging specifications and API definitions from the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) platform. However, fine-tuning base LLMs for telecom-specific tasks remains expensive and resource-intensive. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a practical alternative through in-context learning, enabling domain adaptation without full retraining. While traditional RAG systems rely on vector-based retrieval, emerging variants such as GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG incorporate knowledge graphs or dual retrieval strategies to support multi-hop reasoning and improve factual grounding. Despite their promise, these methods lack systematic, metric-driven evaluations, particularly in high-stakes domains such as ORAN. In this study, we conduct a comparative evaluation of Vector RAG, GraphRAG, and Hybrid GraphRAG using ORAN specifications. We assess performance across varying question complexities using established generation metrics: faithfulness, answer relevance, context relevance, and factual correctness. Results show that both GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG outperform traditional RAG. Hybrid GraphRAG improves factual correctness by 8%, while GraphRAG improves context relevance by 11%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Each to Their Own: Exploring the Optimal Embedding in RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17442v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, as Large Language Models (LLMs) have fundamentally impacted various fields, the methods for incorporating up-to-date information into LLMs or adding external knowledge to construct domain-specific models have garnered wide attention. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), serving as an inference-time scaling method, is notable for its low cost and minimal effort for parameter tuning. However, due to heterogeneous training data and model architecture, the variant embedding models used in RAG exhibit different benefits across various areas, often leading to different similarity calculation results and, consequently, varying response quality from LLMs. To address this problem, we propose and examine two approaches to enhance RAG by combining the benefits of multiple embedding models, named Mixture-Embedding RAG and Confident RAG. Mixture-Embedding RAG simply sorts and selects retrievals from multiple embedding models based on standardized similarity; however, it does not outperform vanilla RAG. In contrast, Confident RAG generates responses multiple times using different embedding models and then selects the responses with the highest confidence level, demonstrating average improvements of approximately 10% and 5% over vanilla LLMs and RAG, respectively. The consistent results across different LLMs and embedding models indicate that Confident RAG is an efficient plug-and-play approach for various domains. We will release our code upon publication.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers a practical and privacy-preserving way to enhance LLMs with external medical knowledge. However, most existing approaches rely on surface-level semantic retrieval and lack the structured reasoning needed for clinical decision support. We introduce MedCoT-RAG, a domain-specific framework that combines causal-aware document retrieval with structured chain-of-thought prompting tailored to medical workflows. This design enables models to retrieve evidence aligned with diagnostic logic and generate step-by-step causal reasoning reflective of real-world clinical practice. Experiments on three diverse medical QA benchmarks show that MedCoT-RAG outperforms strong baselines by up to 10.3% over vanilla RAG and 6.4% over advanced domain-adapted methods, improving accuracy, interpretability, and consistency in complex medical tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, despite the emergence of various RAG frameworks, a single RAG framework still cannot adapt well to a broad range of downstream tasks. Therefore, how to leverage the advantages of multiple RAG systems has become an area worth exploring. To address this issue, we have conducted a comprehensive and systematic investigation into ensemble methods based on RAG systems. Specifically, we have analyzed the RAG ensemble framework from both theoretical and mechanistic analysis perspectives. From the theoretical analysis, we provide the first explanation of the RAG ensemble framework from the perspective of information entropy. In terms of mechanism analysis, we have explored the RAG ensemble framework from both the pipeline and module levels. We carefully select four different pipelines (Branching, Iterative, Loop, and Agentic) and three different modules (Generator, Retriever, and Reranker) to solve seven different research questions. The experiments show that aggregating multiple RAG systems is both generalizable and robust, whether at the pipeline level or the module level. Our work lays the foundation for similar research on the multi-RAG system ensemble.</p></details> |  |

Grid codes, the regulations governing grid operations, are complex and often lack automated interpretation solutions, which hinders industry expansion and undermines profitability for electricity companies. We introduce GridCodex, an end to end framework for grid code reasoning and compliance that leverages large language models and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Our framework advances conventional RAG workflows through multi stage query refinement and enhanced retrieval with RAPTOR. We validate the effectiveness of GridCodex with comprehensive benchmarks, including automated answer assessment across multiple dimensions and regulatory agencies. Experimental results showcase a 26.4% improvement in answer quality and more than a 10 fold increase in recall rate. An ablation study further examines the impact of base model selection.</p></details> |  |

We assess the reliability of synthetic benchmarks across two experiments: one varying retriever parameters while keeping the generator fixed, and another varying the generator with fixed retriever parameters. Across four datasets, of which two open-domain and two proprietary, we find that synthetic benchmarks reliably rank the RAGs varying in terms of retriever configuration, aligning well with human-labeled benchmark baselines. However, they fail to produce consistent RAG rankings when comparing generator architectures. The breakdown possibly arises from a combination of task mismatch between the synthetic and human benchmarks, and stylistic bias favoring certain generators.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for the SynDAiTE workshop at the European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML-PKDD 2025), September 15, 2025 - Porto, Portugal</p></details> |

However, its current workflow remains largely text-centric, limiting its applicability in geoscience. Many geoscientific tasks are inherently evidence-hungry. Typical examples involve imputing missing observations using analog scenes, retrieving equations and parameters to calibrate models, geolocating field photos based on visual cues, or surfacing historical case studies to support policy analyses. A simple ``retrieve-then-generate'' pipeline is insufficient for these needs. We envision Geo-RAG, a next-generation paradigm that reimagines RAG as a modular retrieve $\rightarrow$ reason $\rightarrow$ generate $\rightarrow$ verify loop. Geo-RAG supports four core capabilities: (i) retrieval of multi-modal Earth data; (ii) reasoning under physical and domain constraints; (iii) generation of science-grade artifacts; and (iv) verification of generated hypotheses against numerical models, ground measurements, and expert assessments. This shift opens new opportunities for more trustworthy and transparent geoscience workflows.</p></details> |  |

| **[ComoRAG: A Cognitive-Inspired Memory-Organized RAG for Stateful Long Narrative Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10419v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Narrative comprehension on long stories and novels has been a challenging domain attributed to their intricate plotlines and entangled, often evolving relations among characters and entities. Given the LLM's diminished reasoning over extended context and high computational cost, retrieval-based approaches remain a pivotal role in practice. However, traditional RAG methods can fall short due to their stateless, single-step retrieval process, which often overlooks the dynamic nature of capturing interconnected relations within long-range context. In this work, we propose ComoRAG, holding the principle that narrative reasoning is not a one-shot process, but a dynamic, evolving interplay between new evidence acquisition and past knowledge consolidation, analogous to human cognition when reasoning with memory-related signals in the brain. Specifically, when encountering a reasoning impasse, ComoRAG undergoes iterative reasoning cycles while interacting with a dynamic memory workspace. In each cycle, it generates probing queries to devise new exploratory paths, then integrates the retrieved evidence of new aspects into a global memory pool, thereby supporting the emergence of a coherent context for the query resolution. Across four challenging long-context narrative benchmarks (200K+ tokens), ComoRAG outperforms strong RAG baselines with consistent relative gains up to 11% compared to the strongest baseline. Further analysis reveals that ComoRAG is particularly advantageous for complex queries requiring global comprehension, offering a principled, cognitively motivated paradigm for retrieval-based long context comprehension towards stateful reasoning.

Within financial sectors, modern enterprises increasingly rely on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to address complex compliance requirements in financial document workflows. However, existing solutions struggle to account for the inherent heterogeneity of data (e.g., text, tables, diagrams) and evolving nature of regulatory standards used in financial filings, leading to compromised accuracy in critical information extraction. We propose the FinSage framework as a solution, utilizing a multi-aspect RAG framework tailored for regulatory compliance analysis in multi-modal financial documents. FinSage introduces three innovative components: (1) a multi-modal pre-processing pipeline that unifies diverse data formats and generates chunk-level metadata summaries, (2) a multi-path sparse-dense retrieval system augmented with query expansion (HyDE) and metadata-aware semantic search, and (3) a domain-specialized re-ranking module fine-tuned via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to prioritize compliance-critical content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FinSage achieves an impressive recall of 92.51% on 75 expert-curated questions derived from surpasses the best baseline method on the FinanceBench question answering datasets by 24.06% in accuracy. Moreover, FinSage has been successfully deployed as financial question-answering agent in online meetings, where it has already served more than 1,200 people.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 34th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM2025)</p></details> |

Auditing Membership Leakage in Semi-Black-box RAG Controlling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09105v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and its Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) significantly improve the knowledge coverage and contextual understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) by introducing external knowledge sources. However, retrieval and multimodal fusion obscure content provenance, rendering existing membership inference methods unable to reliably attribute generated outputs to pre-training, external retrieval, or user input, thus undermining privacy leakage accountability To address these challenges, we propose the first Source-aware Membership Audit (SMA) that enables fine-grained source attribution of generated content in a semi-black-box setting with retrieval control capabilities. To address the environmental constraints of semi-black-box auditing, we further design an attribution estimation mechanism based on zero-order optimization, which robustly approximates the true influence of input tokens on the output through large-scale perturbation sampling and ridge regression modeling. In addition, SMA introduces a cross-modal attribution technique that projects image inputs into textual descriptions via MLLMs, enabling token-level attribution in the text modality, which for the first time facilitates membership inference on image retrieval traces in MRAG systems. This work shifts the focus of membership inference from 'whether the data has been memorized' to 'where the content is sourced from', offering a novel perspective for auditing data provenance in complex generative systems.</p></details> |  |

Data augmentation can potentially alleviate the data shortage, but augmenting vulnerable code is challenging and requires a generative solution that maintains vulnerability. Previous works have only focused on generating samples that contain single statements or specific types of vulnerabilities. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to solve various code generation and comprehension tasks with inspiring results, especially when fused with retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Therefore, we propose VulScribeR, a novel LLM-based solution that leverages carefully curated prompt templates to augment vulnerable datasets. More specifically, we explore three strategies to augment both single and multi-statement vulnerabilities, with LLMs, namely Mutation, Injection, and Extension. Our extensive evaluation across four vulnerability datasets and DLVD models, using three LLMs, show that our approach beats two SOTA methods Vulgen and VGX, and Random Oversampling (ROS) by 27.48%, 27.93%, and 15.41% in f1-score with 5K generated vulnerable samples on average, and 53.84%, 54.10%, 69.90%, and 40.93% with 15K generated vulnerable samples. Our approach demonstrates its feasibility for large-scale data augmentation by generating 1K samples at as cheap as US$ 1.88.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TOSEM; 26 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables, 3 prompt templates, 1 algorithm</p></details> |

These systems face challenges in understanding and generating authentic Cantonese colloquial expressions due to limited annotated data and linguistic variability. The review evaluates the integration of LoRA within RAG frameworks, benchmarks PEFT methods for retrieval and generation accuracy, identify domain adaptation strategies under limited data, and compares fine-tuning techniques aimed at improving semantic fidelity under data-scarce conditions. A systematic analysis of recent studies employing diverse LoRA variants, synthetic data generation, user feedback integration, and adaptive parameter allocation was conducted to assess their impact on computational efficiency, retrieval precision, linguistic authenticity, and scalability. Findings reveal that dynamic and ensemble LoRA adaptations significantly reduce trainable parameters without sacrificing retrieval accuracy and generation quality in dialectal contexts. However, limitations remain in fully preserving fine-grained linguistic nuances, especially for low-resource settings like Cantonese. The integration of real-time user feedback and domain-specific data remains underdeveloped, limiting model adaptability and personalization. While selective parameter freezing and nonlinear adaptation methods offer better trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy, their robustness at scale remains an open challenge. This review highlights the promise of PEFT-enhanced RAG systems for domain-specific language tasks and calls for future work targeting dialectal authenticity, dynamic adaptation, and scalable fine-tuning pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 1 figure, 8 tables</p></details> |

These limitations manifest as two key challenges: pervasive misinformation in the web environment, which introduces unreliable or misleading content that can degrade retrieval accuracy, and the underutilization of web tools, which, if effectively employed, could enhance query precision and help mitigate this noise, ultimately improving the retrieval results in RAG systems. To address these issues, we propose WebFilter, a novel RAG framework that generates source-restricted queries and filters out unreliable content. This approach combines a retrieval filtering mechanism with a behavior- and outcome-driven reward strategy, optimizing both query formulation and retrieval outcomes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WebFilter improves answer quality and retrieval precision, outperforming existing RAG methods on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, user understanding, practices and expectations regarding these memory systems are not yet well understood. This paper presents a thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with 18 users to explore their mental models of LLM's Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)-based memory, current usage practices, perceived benefits and drawbacks, privacy concerns and expectations for future memory systems. Our findings reveal diverse and often incomplete mental models of how memory operates. While users appreciate the potential for enhanced personalization and efficiency, significant concerns exist regarding privacy, control and the accuracy of remembered information. Users express a desire for granular control over memory generation, management, usage and updating, including clear mechanisms for reviewing, editing, deleting and categorizing memories, as well as transparent insight into how memories and inferred information are used. We discuss design implications for creating more user-centric, transparent, and trustworthy LLM memory systems.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods primarily focus on improving retrieval and rely on large language models (LLMs) to implicitly integrate the retrieved context with the query. However, such models are often sensitive to retrieval quality and may generate responses that are misaligned with user preferences. To address this limitation, we propose PrLM, a reinforcement learning framework that trains LLMs to explicitly reason over retrieved user profiles. Guided by a contrastively trained personalization reward model, PrLM effectively learns from user responses without requiring annotated reasoning paths. Experiments on three personalized text generation datasets show that PrLM outperforms existing methods and remains robust across varying numbers of retrieved profiles and different retrievers.</p></details> |  |

We present classification using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which shifts traditional classification tasks from determining the correct category in accordance with pre-trained parameters to evaluating content in relation to contextual knowledge retrieved at inference. In hate speech detection, this transforms the task from "is this hate speech?" to "does this violate the hate speech policy?" Our Contextual Policy Engine (CPE) - an agentic RAG system - demonstrates this approach and offers three key advantages: (1) robust classification accuracy comparable to leading commercial systems, (2) inherent explainability via retrieved policy segments, and (3) dynamic policy updates without model retraining. Through three experiments, we demonstrate strong baseline performance and show that the system can apply fine-grained policy control by correctly adjusting protection for specific identity groups without requiring retraining or compromising overall performance. These findings establish that RAG can transform classification into a more flexible, transparent, and adaptable process for content moderation and wider classification problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[UR$^2$: Unify RAG and Reasoning through Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06165v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities through two complementary paradigms: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which enhances knowledge grounding, and Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), which optimizes complex reasoning abilities. However, these two capabilities are often developed in isolation, and existing efforts to unify them remain narrow in scope-typically limited to open-domain QA with fixed retrieval settings and task-specific assumptions. This lack of integration constrains generalization and limits the applicability of RAG-RL methods to broader domains. To bridge this gap, we propose UR2 (Unified RAG and Reasoning), a general framework that unifies retrieval and reasoning through reinforcement learning. UR2 introduces two key contributions: a difficulty-aware curriculum training that selectively invokes retrieval only for challenging problems, and a hybrid knowledge access strategy combining domain-specific offline corpora with LLM-generated summaries. These components are designed to enable dynamic coordination between retrieval and reasoning, improving adaptability across a diverse range of tasks. Experiments across open-domain QA, MMLU-Pro, medical, and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that UR2 (built on Qwen2.5-3/7B and LLaMA-3.1-8B) significantly outperforms existing RAG and RL methods, achieving comparable performance to GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4.1-mini on several benchmarks. We have released all code, models, and data at https://github.com/Tsinghua-dhy/UR2.</p></details> |  |
| **[You Don't Need Pre-built Graphs for RAG: Retrieval Augmented Generation with Adaptive Reasoning Structures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06105v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often suffer from hallucination, generating factually incorrect statements when handling questions beyond their knowledge and perception. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this by retrieving query-relevant contexts from knowledge bases to support LLM reasoning. Recent advances leverage pre-constructed graphs to capture the relational connections among distributed documents, showing remarkable performance in complex tasks. However, existing Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) methods rely on a costly process to transform the corpus into a graph, introducing overwhelming token cost and update latency. Moreover, real-world queries vary in type and complexity, requiring different logic structures for accurate reasoning. The pre-built graph may not align with these required structures, resulting in ineffective knowledge retrieval. To this end, we propose a \textbf{\underline{Logic}}-aware \textbf{\underline{R}}etrieval-\textbf{\underline{A}}ugmented \textbf{\underline{G}}eneration framework (\textbf{LogicRAG}) that dynamically extracts reasoning structures at inference time to guide adaptive retrieval without any pre-built graph. LogicRAG begins by decomposing the input query into a set of subproblems and constructing a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to model the logical dependencies among them. To support coherent multi-step reasoning, LogicRAG then linearizes the graph using topological sort, so that subproblems can be addressed in a logically consistent order. Besides, LogicRAG applies graph pruning to reduce redundant retrieval and uses context pruning to filter irrelevant context, significantly reducing the overall token cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LogicRAG achieves both superior performance and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

While GraphRAG has shown promise for multi-hop reasoning and structured retrieval, its adoption has been limited by the high computational cost of constructing knowledge graphs using large language models (LLMs) and the latency of graph-based retrieval. To address these challenges, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a dependency-based knowledge graph construction pipeline that leverages industrial-grade NLP libraries to extract entities and relations from unstructured text completely eliminating reliance on LLMs; and (2) a lightweight graph retrieval strategy that combines hybrid query node identification with efficient one-hop traversal for high-recall, low-latency subgraph extraction. We evaluate our framework on two SAP datasets focused on legacy code migration and demonstrate strong empirical performance. Our system achieves up to 15% and 4.35% improvements over traditional RAG baselines based on LLM-as-Judge and RAGAS metrics, respectively. Moreover, our dependency-based construction approach attains 94% of the performance of LLM-generated knowledge graphs (61.87% vs. 65.83%) while significantly reducing cost and improving scalability. These results validate the feasibility of deploying GraphRAG systems in real-world, large-scale enterprise applications without incurring prohibitive resource requirements paving the way for practical, explainable, and domain-adaptable retrieval-augmented reasoning.</p></details> |  |

We introduce RankArena, a unified platform for comparing and analysing the performance of retrieval pipelines, rerankers, and RAG systems using structured human and LLM-based feedback as well as for collecting such feedback. RankArena supports multiple evaluation modes: direct reranking visualisation, blind pairwise comparisons with human or LLM voting, supervised manual document annotation, and end-to-end RAG answer quality assessment. It captures fine-grained relevance feedback through both pairwise preferences and full-list annotations, along with auxiliary metadata such as movement metrics, annotation time, and quality ratings. The platform also integrates LLM-as-a-judge evaluation, enabling comparison between model-generated rankings and human ground truth annotations. All interactions are stored as structured evaluation datasets that can be used to train rerankers, reward models, judgment agents, or retrieval strategy selectors. Our platform is publicly available at https://rankarena.ngrok.io/, and the Demo video is provided https://youtu.be/jIYAP4PaSSI.</p></details> | Accept at CIKM 2025 |

Despite impressive advancements, vanilla RAG-based VQA methods that rely on unstructured documents and overlook the structural relationships among knowledge elements frequently introduce irrelevant or misleading content, reducing answer accuracy and reliability. To overcome these challenges, a promising solution is to integrate multimodal knowledge graphs (KGs) into RAG-based VQA frameworks to enhance the generation by introducing structured multimodal knowledge. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel multimodal knowledge-augmented generation framework (mKG-RAG) based on multimodal KGs for knowledge-intensive VQA tasks. Specifically, our approach leverages MLLM-powered keyword extraction and vision-text matching to distill semantically consistent and modality-aligned entities/relationships from multimodal documents, constructing high-quality multimodal KGs as structured knowledge representations. In addition, a dual-stage retrieval strategy equipped with a question-aware multimodal retriever is introduced to improve retrieval efficiency while refining precision. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for knowledge-based VQA.</p></details> |  |

However, existing RAG methods typically retrieve from either text or images in isolation, limiting their ability to address complex queries that require multi-hop reasoning or up-to-date factual knowledge. To address this limitation, we propose QA-Dragon, a Query-Aware Dynamic RAG System for Knowledge-Intensive VQA. Specifically, QA-Dragon introduces a domain router to identify the query's subject domain for domain-specific reasoning, along with a search router that dynamically selects optimal retrieval strategies. By orchestrating both text and image search agents in a hybrid setup, our system supports multimodal, multi-turn, and multi-hop reasoning, enabling it to tackle complex VQA tasks effectively. We evaluate our QA-Dragon on the Meta CRAG-MM Challenge at KDD Cup 2025, where it significantly enhances the reasoning performance of base models under challenging scenarios. Our framework achieves substantial improvements in both answer accuracy and knowledge overlap scores, outperforming baselines by 5.06% on the single-source task, 6.35% on the multi-source task, and 5.03% on the multi-turn task.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The source code for our system is released in https://github.com/jzzzzh/QA-Dragon</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal RAG Enhanced Visual Description](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09170v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Textual descriptions for multimodal inputs entail recurrent refinement of queries to produce relevant output images. Despite efforts to address challenges such as scaling model size and data volume, the cost associated with pre-training and fine-tuning remains substantial. However, pre-trained large multimodal models (LMMs) encounter a modality gap, characterised by a misalignment between textual and visual representations within a common embedding space. Although fine-tuning can potentially mitigate this gap, it is typically expensive and impractical due to the requirement for extensive domain-driven data. To overcome this challenge, we propose a lightweight training-free approach utilising Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to extend across the modality using a linear mapping, which can be computed efficiently. During inference, this mapping is applied to images embedded by an LMM enabling retrieval of closest textual descriptions from the training set. These textual descriptions, in conjunction with an instruction, cater as an input prompt for the language model to generate new textual descriptions. In addition, we introduce an iterative technique for distilling the mapping by generating synthetic descriptions via the language model facilitating optimisation for standard utilised image description measures. Experimental results on two benchmark multimodal datasets demonstrate significant improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM CIKM 2025. 5 pages, 2 figures</p></details> |
| **[PAIRS: Parametric-Verified Adaptive Information Retrieval and Selection for Efficient RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04057v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a cornerstone technique for enhancing large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. However, current RAG systems face two critical limitations: (1) they inefficiently retrieve information for every query, including simple questions that could be resolved using the LLM's parametric knowledge alone, and (2) they risk retrieving irrelevant documents when queries contain sparse information signals. To address these gaps, we introduce Parametric-verified Adaptive Information Retrieval and Selection (PAIRS), a training-free framework that integrates parametric and retrieved knowledge to adaptively determine whether to retrieve and how to select external information. Specifically, PAIRS employs a dual-path generation mechanism: First, the LLM produces both a direct answer and a context-augmented answer using self-generated pseudo-context. When these outputs converge, PAIRS bypasses external retrieval entirely, dramatically improving the RAG system's efficiency. For divergent cases, PAIRS activates a dual-path retrieval (DPR) process guided by both the original query and self-generated contextual signals, followed by an Adaptive Information Selection (AIS) module that filters documents through weighted similarity to both sources. This simple yet effective approach can not only enhance efficiency by eliminating unnecessary retrievals but also improve accuracy through contextually guided retrieval and adaptive information selection. Experimental results on six question-answering (QA) benchmarks show that PAIRS reduces retrieval costs by around 25% (triggering for only 75% of queries) while still improving accuracy-achieving +1.1% EM and +1.0% F1 over prior baselines on average.</p></details> |  |
| **[MetaGen Blended RAG: Unlocking Zero-Shot Precision for Specialized Domain Question-Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18247v3)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) struggles with domain-specific enterprise datasets, often isolated behind firewalls and rich in complex, specialized terminology unseen by LLMs during pre-training. Semantic variability across domains like medicine, networking, or law hampers RAG's context precision, while fine-tuning solutions are costly, slow, and lack generalization as new data emerges. Achieving zero-shot precision with retrievers without fine-tuning still remains a key challenge. We introduce 'MetaGen Blended RAG', a novel enterprise search approach that enhances semantic retrievers through a metadata generation pipeline and hybrid query indexes using dense and sparse vectors. By leveraging key concepts, topics, and acronyms, our method creates metadata-enriched semantic indexes and boosted hybrid queries, delivering robust, scalable performance without fine-tuning. On the biomedical PubMedQA dataset, MetaGen Blended RAG achieves 82% retrieval accuracy and 77% RAG accuracy, surpassing all prior zero-shot RAG benchmarks and even rivaling fine-tuned models on that dataset, while also excelling on datasets like SQuAD and NQ. This approach redefines enterprise search using a new approach to building semantic retrievers with unmatched generalization across specialized domains.</p></details> |  |

Our fact-checking system is a simple two-step RAG pipeline based on our last year's submission. We show how the pipeline can be redeployed on-premise, achieving state-of-the-art fact-checking performance (in sense of Ev2R test-score), even under the constraint of a single NVidia A10 GPU, 23GB of graphical memory and 60s running time per claim.</p></details> |  |
| **[Token-Level Precise Attack on RAG: Searching for the Best Alternatives to Mislead Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03110v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in providing trustworthy responses for knowledge-intensive tasks, they still face critical limitations such as hallucinations and outdated knowledge. To address these issues, the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework enhances LLMs with access to external knowledge via a retriever, enabling more accurate and real-time outputs about the latest events. However, this integration brings new security vulnerabilities: the risk that malicious content in the external database can be retrieved and used to manipulate model outputs. Although prior work has explored attacks on RAG systems, existing approaches either rely heavily on access to the retriever or fail to jointly consider both retrieval and generation stages, limiting their effectiveness, particularly in black-box scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose Token-level Precise Attack on the RAG (TPARAG), a novel framework that targets both white-box and black-box RAG systems. TPARAG leverages a lightweight white-box LLM as an attacker to generate and iteratively optimize malicious passages at the token level, ensuring both retrievability and high attack success in generation. Extensive experiments on open-domain QA datasets demonstrate that TPARAG consistently outperforms previous approaches in retrieval-stage and end-to-end attack effectiveness. These results further reveal critical vulnerabilities in RAG pipelines and offer new insights into improving their robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Multi-Round Diagnostic RAG Framework for Emulating Clinical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07724v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, accurately and quickly deploying medical large language models (LLMs) has become a trend. Among these, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has garnered attention due to rapid deployment and privacy protection. However, the challenge hinder the practical deployment of RAG for medical diagnosis: the semantic gap between colloquial patient descriptions and the professional terminology within medical knowledge bases. We try to address the challenge from the data perspective and the method perspective. First, to address the semantic gap in existing knowledge bases, we construct DiagnosGraph, a generalist knowledge graph covering both modern medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine. It contains 876 common diseases with the graph of 7,997 nodes and 37,201 triples. To bridge the gap between colloquial patient narratives and academic medical knowledge, DiagnosGraph also introduces $1,908$ medical record by formalizing the patient chief complaint and proposing a medical diagnosis. Second, we introduce the Multi-Round Diagnostic RAG (MRD-RAG) framework. It utilizes a multi-round dialogue to refine diagnostic possibilities, emulating the clinical reasoning of a physician. Experiments conducted on four medical benchmarks, with evaluations by human physicians, demonstrate that MRD-RAG enhances the diagnostic performance of LLMs, highlighting its potential to make automated diagnosis more accurate and human-aligned.</p></details> |  |
| **[Highlight & Summarize: RAG without the jailbreaks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02872v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preventing jailbreaking and model hijacking of Large Language Models (LLMs) is an important yet challenging task. For example, when interacting with a chatbot, malicious users can input specially crafted prompts to cause the LLM to generate undesirable content or perform a completely different task from its intended purpose. Existing mitigations for such attacks typically rely on hardening the LLM's system prompt or using a content classifier trained to detect undesirable content or off-topic conversations. However, these probabilistic approaches are relatively easy to bypass due to the very large space of possible inputs and undesirable outputs. In this paper, we present and evaluate Highlight & Summarize (H&S), a new design pattern for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that prevents these attacks by design. The core idea is to perform the same task as a standard RAG pipeline (i.e., to provide natural language answers to questions, based on relevant sources) without ever revealing the user's question to the generative LLM. This is achieved by splitting the pipeline into two components: a highlighter, which takes the user's question and extracts relevant passages ("highlights") from the retrieved documents, and a summarizer, which takes the highlighted passages and summarizes them into a cohesive answer. We describe several possible instantiations of H&S and evaluate their generated responses in terms of correctness, relevance, and response quality. Surprisingly, when using an LLM-based highlighter, the majority of H&S responses are judged to be better than those of a standard RAG pipeline.</p></details> |  |

One such domain is software development, where researchers have pushed the automation of a number of code tasks through LLM agents. Software development is a complex ecosystem, that stretches far beyond code implementation and well into the realm of code maintenance. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent system to localize bugs in large pre-existing codebases using information retrieval and LLMs. Our system introduces a novel Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, Meta-RAG, where we utilize summaries to condense codebases by an average of 79.8\%, into a compact, structured, natural language representation. We then use an LLM agent to determine which parts of the codebase are critical for bug resolution, i.e. bug localization. We demonstrate the usefulness of Meta-RAG through evaluation with the SWE-bench Lite dataset. Meta-RAG scores 84.67 % and 53.0 % for file-level and function-level correct localization rates, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we evaluate four methodologies for Out-Of-Domain (OOD) query detection: GPT-4o, regression-based, Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-based, and Neural Collapse (NC), to ensure the RAG system only responds to queries confined to the system's knowledge base. Specifically, our evaluation explores two novel dimensionality reduction and feature separation strategies: \textit{PCA}, where top components are selected using explained variance or OOD separability, and an adaptation of \textit{Neural Collapse Feature Separation}. We validate our approach on standard datasets (StackExchange and MSMARCO) and real-world applications (Substance Use and COVID-19), including tests against LLM-simulated and actual attacks on a COVID-19 vaccine chatbot. Through human and LLM-based evaluations of response correctness and relevance, we confirm that an external OOD detector is crucial for maintaining response relevance.</p></details> |  |

Although informative, this volume can lead to cognitive overload, making it difficult for users to quickly and accurately find the information they need. Existing Product Question Answering (PQA) systems often fail to utilize rich user context and diverse product information effectively. We propose a scalable, end-to-end framework for e-commerce PQA using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that deeply integrates contextual understanding. Our system leverages conversational history, user profiles, and product attributes to deliver relevant and personalized answers. It adeptly handles objective, subjective, and multi-intent queries across heterogeneous sources, while also identifying information gaps in the catalog to support ongoing content improvement.

We present PunGPT2, the first fully open-source suite of Punjabi large language models, trained from scratch on a 35GB domain-diverse corpus encompassing literature, religious texts, news, and social discourse. Unlike prior multilingual approaches, PunGPT2 captures rich syntactic and morphological features unique to Punjabi through a tokenizer optimised with byte pair encoding and linguistically aligned pretraining objectives. To improve factual grounding and domain recall, we introduce Pun-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework combining PunGPT2 with a dense FAISS retriever over a curated Punjabi knowledge base. We further develop Pun-Instruct, a parameter-efficient, instruction-tuned variant using QLoRA, enabling robust zero-shot and instruction-following performance with significantly reduced compute needs. As a key innovation, we propose Quantum-RAG, a novel hybrid retrieval system that fuses sparse (BM25) and dense methods with quantum-inspired semantic matching. By encoding queries using amplitude-based embeddings and retrieving via quantum kernel similarity, Quantum-RAG achieves improved contextual relevance with minimal memory overhead marking the first practical integration of quantum representations in low-resource language generation. Our models significantly outperform strong multilingual baselines (mBERT, mT5, MuRIL) in perplexity, factuality, and fluency. This work provides a scalable, reproducible blueprint for extending LLM capabilities to underrepresented languages and pioneers quantum-aware retrieval in low-resource NLP</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by incorporating external information, often from graph-structured data. However, existing graph-based RAG methods suffer from poor graph quality due to incomplete extraction and insufficient utilization of query information during retrieval. To overcome these limitations, we propose Clue-RAG, a novel approach that introduces (1) a multi-partite graph index incorporates Chunk, knowledge unit, and entity to capture semantic content at multiple levels of granularity, coupled with a hybrid extraction strategy that reduces LLM token usage while still producing accurate and disambiguated knowledge units, and (2) Q-Iter, a query-driven iterative retrieval strategy that enhances relevance through semantic search and constrained graph traversal. Experiments on three QA benchmarks show that Clue-RAG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 99.33% higher Accuracy and 113.51% higher F1 score while reducing indexing costs by 72.58%. Remarkably, Clue-RAG matches or outperforms baselines even without using an LLM for indexing. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of Clue-RAG in advancing graph-based RAG systems.</p></details> |  |

Sherpa Rx integrated Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines with Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB) data to generate contextually relevant responses. A dataset (N=260 queries) spanning 26 CPIC guidelines was used to evaluate drug-gene interactions, dosing recommendations, and therapeutic implications. In Phase 1, only CPIC data was embedded. Phase 2 additionally incorporated PharmGKB content. Responses were scored on accuracy, relevance, clarity, completeness (5-point Likert scale), and recall. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests compared accuracy between Phase 1 and Phase 2, and between Phase 2 and ChatGPT-4omini. A 20-question quiz assessed the tool's real-world applicability against other models. In Phase 1 (N=260), Sherpa Rx demonstrated high performance of accuracy 4.9, relevance 5.0, clarity 5.0, completeness 4.8, and recall 0.99. The subset analysis (N=20) showed improvements in accuracy (4.6 vs. 4.4, Phase 2 vs. Phase 1 subset) and completeness (5.0 vs. 4.8). ChatGPT-4omini performed comparably in relevance (5.0) and clarity (4.9) but lagged in accuracy (3.9) and completeness (4.2). Differences in accuracy between Phase 1 and Phase 2 was not statistically significant. However, Phase 2 significantly outperformed ChatGPT-4omini. On the 20-question quiz, Sherpa Rx achieved 90% accuracy, outperforming other models. Integrating additional resources like CPIC and PharmGKB with RAG enhances AI accuracy and performance. This study highlights the transformative potential of generative AI like Sherpa Rx in pharmacogenomics, improving decision-making with accurate, personalized responses.</p></details> |  |

Among completion tasks, Method Body Completion (MBC) is particularly challenging as it involves generating complete method bodies based on their signatures and context. This task becomes significantly harder in large repositories, where method bodies must integrate repositoryspecific elements such as custom APIs, inter-module dependencies, and project-specific conventions. In this paper, we introduce RAMBO, a novel RAG-based approach for repository-level MBC. Instead of retrieving similar method bodies, RAMBO identifies essential repository-specific elements, such as classes, methods, and variables/fields, and their relevant usages. By incorporating these elements and their relevant usages into the code generation process, RAMBO ensures more accurate and contextually relevant method bodies. Our experimental results with leading code LLMs across 40 Java projects show that RAMBO significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art repository-level MBC approaches, with the improvements of up to 46% in BLEU, 57% in CodeBLEU, 36% in Compilation Rate, and up to 3X in Exact Match. Notably, RAMBO surpassed RepoCoder Oracle method by up to 12% in Exact Match, setting a new benchmark for repository-level MBC.</p></details> |  |

While previous approaches in the Indian context have relied on internal case content such as facts, issues, and reasoning, they often overlook a core element of common law systems, which is reliance on statutory provisions and judicial precedents. In this work, we propose NyayaRAG, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that simulates realistic courtroom scenarios by providing models with factual case descriptions, relevant legal statutes, and semantically retrieved prior cases. NyayaRAG evaluates the effectiveness of these combined inputs in predicting court decisions and generating legal explanations using a domain-specific pipeline tailored to the Indian legal system. We assess performance across various input configurations using both standard lexical and semantic metrics as well as LLM-based evaluators such as G-Eval. Our results show that augmenting factual inputs with structured legal knowledge significantly improves both predictive accuracy and explanation quality.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods have aimed to enhance models' search and reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL). Although these methods demonstrate promising results, they face challenges in training stability and encounter issues such as substantial inference time and restricted capabilities due to reliance on single-query mode. In this paper, we propose RAG-R1, a novel training framework designed to enable LLMs to adaptively leverage internal and external knowledge during the reasoning process. We further expand the generation and retrieval processes within the framework from single-query mode to multi-query parallelism, with the aim of reducing inference time and enhancing the model's capabilities. Extensive experiments on seven question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the strongest baseline by up to 13.2% and decreases inference time by 11.1%.</p></details> |  |

Existing RAG methods often suffer from deviations in reasoning paths and cumulative errors in intermediate steps, reducing the fidelity of the final answer. To address these limitations, we propose PAR-RAG (Plan-then-Act-and-Review RAG), a novel framework inspired by the PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) cycle, to enhance both the accuracy and factual consistency in multi-hop question answering. Specifically, PAR-RAG selects exemplars matched by the semantic complexity of the current question to guide complexity-aware top-down planning, resulting in more precise and coherent multi-step reasoning trajectories. This design mitigates reasoning drift and reduces the risk of suboptimal path convergence, a common issue in existing RAG approaches. Furthermore, a dual-verification mechanism evaluates and corrects intermediate errors, ensuring that the reasoning process remains factually grounded. Experimental results on various QA benchmarks demonstrate that PAR-RAG outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness in both performance and reasoning robustness.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |

Full-scale indices incur high memory costs; periodic rebuilds introduce latency that undermines data freshness; naive sampling sacrifices semantic coverage. We present Streaming RAG, a unified pipeline that combines multi-vector cosine screening, mini-batch clustering, and a counter-based heavy-hitter filter to maintain a compact prototype set. We further prove an approximation bound \$E\[R(K\_t)] \ge R^\* - L \Delta\$ linking retrieval quality to clustering variance. An incremental index upsert mechanism refreshes prototypes without interrupting queries. Experiments on eight real-time streams show statistically significant gains in Recall\@10 (up to 3 points, p < 0.01), end-to-end latency below 15 ms, and throughput above 900 documents per second under a 150 MB budget. Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis over cluster count, admission probability, relevance threshold, and counter capacity validates default settings. In open-domain question answering with GPT-3.5 Turbo, we record 3.2-point gain in Exact Match and 2.8-point gain in F1 on SQuAD; abstractive summarization yields ROUGE-L improvements. Streaming RAG establishes a new Pareto frontier for retrieval augmentation.</p></details> |  |

However, their effectiveness remains constrained when reasoning extends beyond the knowledge acquired during pretraining. Conventional approaches, such as fine-tuning or retrieval-augmented generation, face limitations in either imposing high computational overhead or failing to fully exploit structured scientific data. To overcome these challenges, we propose DrugMCTS, a novel framework that synergistically integrates RAG, multi-agent collaboration, and Monte Carlo Tree Search for drug repositioning. The framework employs five specialized agents tasked with retrieving and analyzing molecular and protein information, thereby enabling structured and iterative reasoning. Extensive experiments on the DrugBank and KIBA datasets demonstrate that DrugMCTS achieves substantially higher recall and robustness compared to both general-purpose LLMs and deep learning baselines. Our results highlight the importance of structured reasoning, agent-based collaboration, and feedback-driven search mechanisms in advancing LLM applications for drug repositioning.</p></details> |  |

Although many fine-tuning techniques have been developed to reduce the time and computational cost involved, the challenge persists as LLMs continue to grow in size and complexity. To address this, a new approach to knowledge expansion in LLMs is needed. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers one such alternative by storing external knowledge in a database and retrieving relevant chunks to support question answering. However, naive implementations of RAG face significant limitations in scalability and answer accuracy. This paper introduces KeyKnowledgeRAG (K2RAG), a novel framework designed to overcome these limitations. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer paradigm, K2RAG integrates dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text summarization to improve retrieval quality and system efficiency. The framework also includes a preprocessing step that summarizes the training data, significantly reducing the training time. K2RAG was evaluated using the MultiHopRAG dataset, where the proposed pipeline was trained on the document corpus and tested on a separate evaluation set. Results demonstrated notable improvements over common naive RAG implementations. K2RAG achieved the highest mean answer similarity score of 0.57, and reached the highest third quartile (Q3) similarity of 0.82, indicating better alignment with ground-truth answers. In addition to improved accuracy, the framework proved highly efficient. The summarization step reduced the average training time of individual components by 93%, and execution speed was up to 40% faster than traditional knowledge graph-based RAG systems. K2RAG also demonstrated superior scalability, requiring three times less VRAM than several naive RAG implementations tested in this study.</p></details> | 21 pages, 14 figures |

Currently, text visualizations are confined either to _flat, line-based_ decorations, which can convey only limited information about textual structure, or _nested boxes_, which convey structure but often destroy the typographic layout of the underlying text. We hypothesize that the lack of rich styling options limits the kinds of information that are displayed alongside text, wherever it may be displayed. In this paper, we show that it is possible to achieve arbitrarily nested decorations while minimally disturbing the underlying typographic layout. Specifically, we present a layout algorithm that generates _ragged blocks_, or _rocks_, which are rectilinear polygons that allow nested text to be compactly rendered even when styled with borders and padding. Our layout algorithm is evaluated on a benchmark suite comprising representative source code files in multiple programming languages. The (ragged block) layouts produced by our algorithm are substantially more compact than the (rectangular block) layouts produced by conventional techniques, when uniformly styling every element in the syntax tree with borders and padding.</p></details> | <details><summary>UIST ...</summary><p>UIST 2025 Paper + Appendices</p></details> |

Hybrid Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, combining graph queries with vector search offer promise but are typically static, rely on proprietary tools, and lack uncertainty estimates. We present an agentic approach that encapsulates the hybrid RAG pipeline within an autonomous agent capable of (1) dynamically selecting between GraphRAG and VectorRAG for each query, (2) adapting instruction-tuned generation in real time to researcher needs, and (3) quantifying uncertainty during inference. This dynamic orchestration improves relevance, reduces hallucinations, and promotes reproducibility. Our pipeline ingests bibliometric open-access data from PubMed, arXiv, and Google Scholar APIs, builds a Neo4j citation-based knowledge graph (KG), and embeds full-text PDFs into a FAISS vector store (VS) using the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model. A Llama-3.3-70B agent selects GraphRAG (translating queries to Cypher for KG) or VectorRAG (combining sparse and dense retrieval with re-ranking). Instruction tuning refines domain-specific generation, and bootstrapped evaluation yields standard deviation for evaluation metrics. On synthetic benchmarks mimicking real-world queries, the Instruction-Tuned Agent with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) outperforms the baseline, achieving a gain of 0.63 in VS Context Recall and a 0.56 gain in overall Context Precision.

| **[RaGS: Unleashing 3D Gaussian Splatting from 4D Radar and Monocular Cues for 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19856v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>4D millimeter-wave radar has emerged as a promising sensor for autonomous driving, but effective 3D object detection from both 4D radar and monocular images remains a challenge. Existing fusion approaches typically rely on either instance-based proposals or dense BEV grids, which either lack holistic scene understanding or are limited by rigid grid structures. To address these, we propose RaGS, the first framework to leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) as representation for fusing 4D radar and monocular cues in 3D object detection. 3D GS naturally suits 3D object detection by modeling the scene as a field of Gaussians, dynamically allocating resources on foreground objects and providing a flexible, resource-efficient solution. RaGS uses a cascaded pipeline to construct and refine the Gaussian field. It starts with the Frustum-based Localization Initiation (FLI), which unprojects foreground pixels to initialize coarse 3D Gaussians positions. Then, the Iterative Multimodal Aggregation (IMA) fuses semantics and geometry, refining the limited Gaussians to the regions of interest. Finally, the Multi-level Gaussian Fusion (MGF) renders the Gaussians into multi-level BEV features for 3D object detection. By dynamically focusing on sparse objects within scenes, RaGS enable object concentrating while offering comprehensive scene perception. Extensive experiments on View-of-Delft, TJ4DRadSet, and OmniHD-Scenes benchmarks demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance. Code will be released.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, conference</p></details> |
| **[Culinary Crossroads: A RAG Framework for Enhancing Diversity in Cross-Cultural Recipe Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21934v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In cross-cultural recipe adaptation, the goal is not only to ensure cultural appropriateness and retain the original dish's essence, but also to provide diverse options for various dietary needs and preferences. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a promising approach, combining the retrieval of real recipes from the target cuisine for cultural adaptability with large language models (LLMs) for relevance. However, it remains unclear whether RAG can generate diverse adaptation results. Our analysis shows that RAG tends to overly rely on a limited portion of the context across generations, failing to produce diverse outputs even when provided with varied contextual inputs. This reveals a key limitation of RAG in creative tasks with multiple valid answers: it fails to leverage contextual diversity for generating varied responses. To address this issue, we propose CARRIAGE, a plug-and-play RAG framework for cross-cultural recipe adaptation that enhances diversity in both retrieval and context organization. To our knowledge, this is the first RAG framework that explicitly aims to generate highly diverse outputs to accommodate multiple user preferences. Our experiments show that CARRIAGE achieves Pareto efficiency in terms of diversity and quality of recipe adaptation compared to closed-book LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[FB-RAG: Improving RAG with Forward and Backward Lookup](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17206v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) struggles with complex queries that lack strong signals to retrieve the most relevant context, forcing a trade-off between choosing a small context that misses key information and a large context that confuses the LLM. To address this, we propose Forward-Backward RAG (FB-RAG), a new training-free framework based on a simple yet powerful forward-looking strategy. FB-RAG employs a light-weight LLM to peek into potential future generations, using evidence from multiple sampled outputs to precisely identify the most relevant context for a final, more powerful generator. This improves performance without complex finetuning or Reinforcement Learning common in prior work. Across 9 datasets, FB-RAG consistently delivers strong results. Further, the performance gains can be achieved with reduced latency due to a shorter, more focused prompt for the powerful generator. On EN.QA dataset, FB-RAG matches the leading baseline with over 48% latency reduction or achieves an 8% performance improvement with a 10% latency reduction. Our analysis finds cases where even when the forward-looking LLM fails to generate correct answers, its attempts are sufficient to guide the final model to an accurate response, demonstrating how smaller LLMs can systematically improve the performance and efficiency of larger ones.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a rigorous evaluation of RAG systems: the challenge of due diligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21753v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of generative AI, has driven significant advancements in high-risk sectors like healthcare and finance. The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, combining language models (LLMs) with search engines, is particularly notable for its ability to generate responses from document corpora. Despite its potential, the reliability of RAG systems in critical contexts remains a concern, with issues such as hallucinations persisting. This study evaluates a RAG system used in due diligence for an investment fund. We propose a robust evaluation protocol combining human annotations and LLM-Judge annotations to identify system failures, like hallucinations, off-topic, failed citations, and abstentions. Inspired by the Prediction Powered Inference (PPI) method, we achieve precise performance measurements with statistical guarantees. We provide a comprehensive dataset for further analysis. Our contributions aim to enhance the reliability and scalability of RAG systems evaluation protocols in industrial applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>in Fr...</summary><p>in French language.

| **[Efficacy of AI RAG Tools for Complex Information Extraction and Data Annotation Tasks: A Case Study Using Banks Public Disclosures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21360v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We utilize a within-subjects design with randomized task assignments to understand the effectiveness of using an AI retrieval augmented generation (RAG) tool to assist analysts with an information extraction and data annotation task. We replicate an existing, challenging real-world annotation task with complex multi-part criteria on a set of thousands of pages of public disclosure documents from global systemically important banks (GSIBs) with heterogeneous and incomplete information content. We test two treatment conditions. First, a "naive" AI use condition in which annotators use only the tool and must accept the first answer they are given. And second, an "interactive" AI treatment condition where annotators use the tool interactively, and use their judgement to follow-up with additional information if necessary. Compared to the human-only baseline, the use of the AI tool accelerated task execution by up to a factor of 10 and enhanced task accuracy, particularly in the interactive condition. We find that when extrapolated to the full task, these methods could save up to 268 hours compared to the human-only approach. Additionally, our findings suggest that annotator skill, not just with the subject matter domain, but also with AI tools, is a factor in both the accuracy and speed of task performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Stage Verification-Centric Framework for Mitigating Hallucination in Multi-Modal RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20136v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents the technical solution developed by team CRUISE for the KDD Cup 2025 Meta Comprehensive RAG Benchmark for Multi-modal, Multi-turn (CRAG-MM) challenge. The challenge aims to address a critical limitation of modern Vision Language Models (VLMs): their propensity to hallucinate, especially when faced with egocentric imagery, long-tail entities, and complex, multi-hop questions. This issue is particularly problematic in real-world applications where users pose fact-seeking queries that demand high factual accuracy across diverse modalities. To tackle this, we propose a robust, multi-stage framework that prioritizes factual accuracy and truthfulness over completeness. Our solution integrates a lightweight query router for efficiency, a query-aware retrieval and summarization pipeline, a dual-pathways generation and a post-hoc verification. This conservative strategy is designed to minimize hallucinations, which incur a severe penalty in the competition's scoring metric. Our approach achieved 3rd place in Task 1, demonstrating the effectiveness of prioritizing answer reliability in complex multi-modal RAG systems. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/Breezelled/KDD-Cup-2025-Meta-CRAG-MM .</p></details> | <details><summary>KDD C...</summary><p>KDD Cup 2025 Meta CRAG-MM Challenge</p></details> |

While RAG demonstrates strong performance on benchmarks largely derived from general-domain corpora like Wikipedia, its effectiveness under realistic, diverse retrieval scenarios remains underexplored. We evaluated RAG systems using MassiveDS, a large-scale datastore with mixture of knowledge, and identified critical limitations: retrieval mainly benefits smaller models, rerankers add minimal value, and no single retrieval source consistently excels. Moreover, current LLMs struggle to route queries across heterogeneous knowledge sources. These findings highlight the need for adaptive retrieval strategies before deploying RAG in real-world settings. Our code and data can be found at https://github.com/ritaranx/RAG_in_the_Wild.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in Progress.

| **[Towards More Robust Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Evaluating RAG Under Adversarial Poisoning Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16708v2)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have emerged as a promising solution to mitigate LLM hallucinations and enhance their performance in knowledge-intensive domains. However, these systems are vulnerable to adversarial poisoning attacks, where malicious passages injected into the retrieval corpus can mislead models into producing factually incorrect outputs. In this paper, we present a rigorously controlled empirical study of how RAG systems behave under such attacks and how their robustness can be improved. On the generation side, we introduce a structured taxonomy of context types-adversarial, untouched, and guiding-and systematically analyze their individual and combined effects on model outputs. On the retrieval side, we evaluate several retrievers to measure how easily they expose LLMs to adversarial contexts. Our findings also reveal that "skeptical prompting" can activate LLMs' internal reasoning, enabling partial self-defense against adversarial passages, though its effectiveness depends strongly on the model's reasoning capacity. Together, our experiments (code available at https://github.com/JinyanSu1/eval_PoisonRaG) and analysis provide actionable insights for designing safer and more resilient RAG systems, paving the way for more reliable real-world deployments.</p></details> |  |
| **[AquiLLM: a RAG Tool for Capturing Tacit Knowledge in Research Groups](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05648v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research groups face persistent challenges in capturing, storing, and retrieving knowledge that is distributed across team members. Although structured data intended for analysis and publication is often well managed, much of a group's collective knowledge remains informal, fragmented, or undocumented--often passed down orally through meetings, mentoring, and day-to-day collaboration. This includes private resources such as emails, meeting notes, training materials, and ad hoc documentation. Together, these reflect the group's tacit knowledge--the informal, experience-based expertise that underlies much of their work. Accessing this knowledge can be difficult, requiring significant time and insider understanding. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems offer promising solutions by enabling users to query and generate responses grounded in relevant source material. However, most current RAG-LLM systems are oriented toward public documents and overlook the privacy concerns of internal research materials. We introduce AquiLLM (pronounced ah-quill-em), a lightweight, modular RAG system designed to meet the needs of research groups. AquiLLM supports varied document types and configurable privacy settings, enabling more effective access to both formal and informal knowledge within scholarly groups.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to US Research Software Engineer Association (US-RSE) 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Systematic Review of Key Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems: Progress, Gaps, and Future Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18910v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) represents a major advancement in natural language processing (NLP), combining large language models (LLMs) with information retrieval systems to enhance factual grounding, accuracy, and contextual relevance. This paper presents a comprehensive systematic review of RAG, tracing its evolution from early developments in open domain question answering to recent state-of-the-art implementations across diverse applications. The review begins by outlining the motivations behind RAG, particularly its ability to mitigate hallucinations and outdated knowledge in parametric models. Core technical components-retrieval mechanisms, sequence-to-sequence generation models, and fusion strategies are examined in detail. A year-by-year analysis highlights key milestones and research trends, providing insight into RAG's rapid growth. The paper further explores the deployment of RAG in enterprise systems, addressing practical challenges related to retrieval of proprietary data, security, and scalability. A comparative evaluation of RAG implementations is conducted, benchmarking performance on retrieval accuracy, generation fluency, latency, and computational efficiency. Persistent challenges such as retrieval quality, privacy concerns, and integration overhead are critically assessed. Finally, the review highlights emerging solutions, including hybrid retrieval approaches, privacy-preserving techniques, optimized fusion strategies, and agentic RAG architectures. These innovations point toward a future of more reliable, efficient, and context-aware knowledge-intensive NLP systems.</p></details> | 33 pages, 2 figures |
